/* bench_rusage.c — the external stopwatch, OUTSIDE both engines.
 *
 * WHY: Lon's directive s200 ("what can we do to get CPU time versus elapsed time -- actually we
 * want both; there were special system calls with nanosecond clocks, why are we not using that")
 * landed on a credibility defect, not a precision one: the cross-engine benchmark harness measured
 * each engine with ITS OWN clock (harness.inc's TIME(), self-reported -- ZT = TIME() ... ZE =
 * TIME() - ZT). Worse, the two engines' TIME() are not even the same KIND of clock: SPITBOL's is
 * CPU time (scripts/build_spitbol_oracle.sh patches zystm() to CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID, and
 * scripts/util_bench_snobol4_engines.sh has documented this since s13 as "patched: CPU-time ms"),
 * while SCRIP's own _TIME_ (src/runtime/core/core.c) is wall-clock (CLOCK_MONOTONIC). A "ms" figure
 * from one engine was never commensurable with a "ms" figure from the other, and self-timing is
 * the first thing hostile scrutiny attacks regardless of whose clock it is. This tool is the fix:
 * ONE external instrument, blind to which engine it is timing, that forks the target unchanged and
 * reads wait4()'s rusage on the way out -- sbl and scrip alike, same code path, same units.
 *
 * WHAT: forks argv[1..], execvp's it verbatim (the child's stdout/stderr are inherited untouched,
 * so a caller diffing a benchmark's stdout against a .ref file, or grepping a self-reported "ms:"
 * line out of it, sees nothing different), and on exit prints ONE line to ITS OWN stderr:
 *   BENCH_RUSAGE: elapsed_ns=<N> user_us=<N> sys_us=<N> maxrss_kb=<N> nivcsw=<N> nvcsw=<N> exit=<N>
 * elapsed_ns is CLOCK_MONOTONIC bracketing the fork/wait4 pair; user_us/sys_us/maxrss_kb/nivcsw/
 * nvcsw come straight out of wait4()'s rusage output for exactly this one child -- not a post-hoc
 * getrusage(RUSAGE_CHILDREN) call, which would accumulate across every child a process has ever
 * reaped rather than naming this one. nivcsw (involuntary context switches) is the load-
 * contamination signal: a run the scheduler preempted mid-flight racks these up, and elapsed time
 * alone cannot tell a contaminated run from a clean one -- CPU time and nivcsw together can.
 *
 * HONEST LIMITS: (a) this measures ONE process invocation, not one loop iteration -- it is the
 * right layer for "how long did the whole benchmark run take", not a replacement for harness.inc's
 * internal iteration counter, which still answers "how much work got done in a fixed budget." Use
 * both, never one in place of the other. (b) maxrss_kb is the CHILD's peak alone, in kilobytes on
 * Linux (BSD reports bytes -- this tool is not tested there). (c) a single sample is one sample;
 * run it under bench_min_of_n.sh or equivalent for a number worth quoting.
 *
 * Build: gcc -O2 -o bench_rusage bench_rusage.c
 * Use:   ./bench_rusage ./scrip --run prog.sno < /dev/null       (elapsed+CPU for SCRIP)
 *        ./bench_rusage ../x64/bin/sbl -bf prog.sno < /dev/null  (elapsed+CPU for the oracle)
