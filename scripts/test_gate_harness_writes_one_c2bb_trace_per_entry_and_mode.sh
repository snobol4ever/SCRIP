# test_gate_harness_writes_one_c2bb_trace_per_entry_and_mode.sh -- WITH S4E_ENTRY_TRACE_DIR SET, THE HARNESS GIVES EVERY ENTRY AND MODE
# ITS OWN SCRIP_C2BB_TRACE FILE, AND util_c2bb_trace_census.py COUNTS A DIRECTORY OF THEM BY MARK (the coo 2026-10-09, the cfo's ask for
# the rank-0 row gc-rt-c-c-to-bb-entries-leave-no-emitted-code-...; the reading it made is .github/findings/2026-10-09-coo-c2bb-trace-reading.md).
# MEASURED: rt_c2bb_hit appends to the ONE path SCRIP_C2BB_TRACE names, so a suite run under one path cannot say which entry entered a
# box from C -- the question the row asks of every mark.
# THE FIXTURE (mktemp, two SNOBOL4 programs, graded through corpus_suite_harness.run_all_modes itself, both modes):
#   apply_witness  APPLY(.SIZE,'abc') -- a builtin applied by name, the rungs' apply.open witness (apply_omitted_args_1)
#   plain_witness  OUTPUT = 'hi' -- enters nothing from C
#   ARM 1  both witnesses PASS in both modes (the hook changes no verdict)
#   ARM 2  apply_witness leaves apply_witness.m3.trace and .m4.trace, each naming apply.open; plain_witness leaves no file
#   ARM 3  the hook leaves no SCRIP_C2BB_TRACE behind in the harness's environment
#   ARM 4  FAIL-ONCE: without S4E_ENTRY_TRACE_DIR no trace file is written anywhere in the fixture
#   ARM 5  the census counts apply.open on 1 entry, m3 1 and m4 1, witness apply_witness; on an empty directory it REFUSES rc=2
# EXIT: 0 all arms pass · 1 an arm failed · 2 could not measure.
