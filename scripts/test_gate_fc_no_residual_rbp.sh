# ZB-VAL-8b GATE (s182, closes s181 FINDING-2026-07-26f HEADLINE 6 "THE FALLBACK IS SILENT").
#
# THE HAZARD: x86_fc_hit(off) returns false when a GRANTED box's flat offset falls outside its own
# fc window, and FR()/FRQ() then QUIETLY emit [rbp+off] instead of [rsp+off-base].  An undersized
# window does not crash and does not emit a wrong address -- it just leaves the box on rbp.  So
# "I converted it" and "it converted" are different facts and nothing in the build distinguished
# them.  Given per-graph flat layout (lt1 and lt2 allocate the SAME construct at different offsets),
# mis-sizing is near-certain at least once as the conversion widens.
#
# WHAT THIS ASSERTS: compile the corpus with SCRIP_FC_AUDIT=1 and count [FC-MISS] events.  A miss is
# emitted by x86_fc_hit exactly when the box IS granted (w>0, base>=0) but the offset misses the
# window -- i.e. precisely the silent fallback, not merely "an rbp reference exists" (ungranted boxes
# legitimately speak rbp; grepping the .s for '[rbp+' cannot tell the two apart, which is why this
# gate reads the COMPILER's own verdict instead of the emitted text).
#
# ================================ s184 CORRECTION -- READ THIS ================================
# The header formerly claimed "BASELINE AT LANDING (s182): 0 misses across 52 demo+feat programs".
# THAT NUMBER WAS NEVER TRUE OF THIS SCRIPT.  Three independent defects made the old headline an
# artifact rather than a measurement, all fixed here:
#
#   (1) TIMEOUT COUNTED AS DATA.  The old body piped `timeout 20 $SCRIP` straight into grep -c, so
#       the pipeline exit status was grep's and timeout's 124 was DISCARDED.  beauty.sno does not
#       terminate in bounded compile time, so its contribution measured WALL-CLOCK PATIENCE, not the
#       compiler: 3,984 misses @20s -> 26,088 @120s, still killed.  Any "total" including it is
#       unreproducible across machines and across sessions (s183 read ~5,600 total where s184 read
#       5,328 on the identical tree -- same compiler, different truncation point).
#   (2) FAILED COMPILES SCORED AS CLEAN.  A program that emits "no code generated" contributes zero
#       misses and was indistinguishable from a program that compiled perfectly.  Two of the 52 were
#       in this state, one of them hiding the single LARGEST miss population in the corpus.
#   (3) INCLUDES NEVER RESOLVED.  demo/expression.sno -INCLUDEs three files that live in
#       snobol4/beauty_suite/.  The gate set no search path, so it silently took defect (2)
#       and scored 0.  With SNO_LIB seeded it compiles clean and reports 11,662 misses -- a
#       population that was invisible for the whole life of the old gate.  (Note REPO-corpus.md
#       documents an include dir demo/inc/ that does not exist in the tree; beauty_suite/ is real.)
#
# MEASURED BASELINE (s184, tree at e5ce9f12+c98ce1c9, deterministic across repeated passes):
#       OK       50 programs   13,006 misses   <-- the ratchet, byte-stable run to run
#       TIMEOUT   1 program    beauty.sno      <-- unbounded compile, QUARANTINED, contributes nothing
#       NOCODE    1 program    f13_eval_code.sno (direct-goto ":< C >" parse defect, see below)
#
# THE GATE IS A RATCHET, NOT A ZERO-ASSERT.  1,344 of those misses sit outside expression.sno and are
# the number s183 measured; the conversion is mid-flight and zero is not yet reachable, so asserting
# 0 would leave the gate permanently red and therefore ignored.  It fails on REGRESSION ABOVE
# BASELINE, and on any NEW timeout / NEW failed compile.  Lower FC_BASELINE as the conversion widens.
#
# ---- RECLASSIFIED (this session): 13,006 WAS 99.1% CORRECT-BY-DESIGN BEHAVIOUR. TRUE RESIDUE = 108 ----
# The counter fired on ANY granted box whose offset left its window, which conflates three events:
#   OWN + full-cell  -> a box with an fc_geom cell addressing its OWN field outside it. THE DEFECT.
#   OWN + window-only-> IR_MATCH_BEGIN. op_fc_wbytes is DOCUMENTED as a partial window (cell-resident
#                       cursor/zeta_mark/zls2_mark at +0/+8/+16; head.end/dcap_mark/incoming_rbp are
#                       "FLAT on both paths -- post-unwind lifetime", read by RELEASE/REPLACE AFTER the
#                       cell dies). Those accesses MUST land on rbp. Counting them made zero unreachable.
#   CROSS            -> the offset belongs to ANOTHER node (op_own_ci is that node's extent end).
#                       Reading a neighbour's flat slot is normal emitter behaviour, never a fallback.
# MEASURED on demo/expression.sno (11,662 of the old 13,006): OWN/full-cell 108 | OWN/HEAD 6,936
# | CROSS 4,618. Corpus-wide the new count is 108 -- i.e. EVERY other program's misses were by-design,
# and s183's 1,344 "non-expression" misses were too. x86_fc_hit now counts only the defect class; its
# RETURN VALUE is untouched, proven by expression.sno's .s being md5-identical across the change.
# ---- SUPERSEDED SAME SESSION: THE RESIDUAL 108 WERE ALSO A MEASUREMENT ARTIFACT. TRUE COUNT = 0 ----
# The 108 were 2 boxes reading +20/+24 past a 16-byte cell.  Tracing them: IR_MATCH_BREAK, result@63792
# + break.cnt/cur@63808, so its storage truly ENDS at 63824 -- but the reads were at 63828/63832, inside
# the NEXT node's result quad.  They are neighbour reads (every consumer reads its operand's slot), not
# this box's own field falling back.  They scored OWN only because op_own_ci said BREAK ran to 63840:
# zls_off() returns e->loff (the SHIFTED locals base for the zls_locals_shifted family) while
# zls_node_bytes() measures from e->off (the RESULT base), so loff+bytes overstates every shifted node's
# end by exactly the shift.  Same base-convention class as the ZLS-CALL-BASE defect.  emit.cpp now
# computes C_i from zls_result_off(); default-port codegen is unaffected (C_i's only other consumer is
# the dormant ZC_PORT_OWNED arm) -- proven by expression.sno's .s staying md5-identical across BOTH
# changes.  Corpus count is now 0 and FC_BASELINE is 0: a real zero-assert at last.
# ---- WHAT ZERO DOES *NOT* MEAN ----
# It means no GRANTED box addresses its OWN field outside its cell.  It does NOT mean the FORTH
# conversion is complete: fc_geom still grants cells to an enumerated registry only, and IR_MATCH_BEGIN
# (570 local fields/160 programs), IR_CALL (405), SEQUENCE (66), DEFER (64), FENCE1 (32), ARBNO (30)
# and VALUE (6) remain unconverted.  Coverage is tracked by fc_geom's list, never by this counter.
