# test_gate_score_v_clause_carries_its_fraction.sh -- the invariant gate for the V-cell CLAUSE
# TRUNCATION class (row score-v-clause-truncation-publishes-a-graded-package-as-ungraded, hq_T
# 2026-09-05; standing rule recorded as ceo CEO-297, "IN A PACKAGE CLAUSE, THE FRACTION LEADS").
#
# WHAT IT PROTECTS. The PROGRESS percent reads the September-10 grid's V column only, and
# util_score_row.py's counted_fractions() reads each package BY CLAUSE: from the package's name to
# the first ` · `, ` -- ` or `; ` after it. A clause with no countable fraction inside that window
# scores ZERO OF THE PACKAGE'S WHOLE POPULATION, visible only under `progress --verbose` -- so a
# cell that is merely WRITTEN WELL (the leaderboard doctrine invites provenance and explanation in a
# cell) publishes a confidently wrong headline the moment that explanation lands BEFORE the number.
#
# MEASURED WITNESS (hq_T, 2026-09-05 18:26-18:34 CDT): folding a fresh INRIA reading into the prolog
# V cell, an em-dash landed before the number, INRIA read NOT YET RUN-GRADED at zero of 445, and the
# board published pl 12% when the truth was 60% (ALL 13% vs 22%) for eight minutes. Same class as
# the snoflake incident already recorded in util_score_row.py (103/180 published as 0/180). Two more
# instances were live when this row was minted and are reconciled by this same landing: prolog `gnu`
# (measured in prose -- "9 of 10 runnable" -- never a slash-fraction, and stale against a fresh
# re-confirmation) and pascal `PAT` (the grid clause flatly asserted "NOT VENDORED, NO RUNNER" while
# the standardized display carried a clean, current 298/427 · 284/427). A fourth, snobol4 `csnobol4`,
# surfaced only once the instrument existed: a real, both-tables-agreed 60/119 · 59/119 sat one
# middot past `total=119`, and PROGRESS_COUNTED's declared populations had not caught up to 119
# either. A fifth, icon `ipl`, was found and cured independently by hq_T in the same window (fold
# icon 96de7361) -- this gate proves it stayed cured, not that it fixed it.
#
# THE INSTRUMENT ITSELF is util_score_row.py's clause_fraction_audit()/`clause-check` subcommand: for
# every package PROGRESS_COUNTED lists, it asks whether counted_fractions' narrow clause window
# genuinely found nothing, or whether a countable `pass/total` fraction exists for that package
# EITHER wider in the same grid cell (past the separator the narrow reader stops at) OR in the
# package's standardized-display twin -- the three-way discipline this project uses everywhere else
# (lib_gate.sh's own three exit codes; counted_fractions' own FOUND/UNREADABLE/ABSENT split) applied
# to this one question: is a zero here GENUINE (stays quiet, no conviction) or a zero the clause
# window was BLINDSIDED into (convicted, named, quoted, with the percent the language would read once
# the clause carries what already exists elsewhere)? ⛔ It REFUSES rc=2 -- die()'s own contract, the
# same one find_grid/find_table use everywhere -- when it cannot read the September-10 grid's row for
# a language PROGRESS_COUNTED lists, rather than reporting CLEAN over a partial read (the vacuous-gate
# class cmd_agree's own header names).
