# util_rtx_count_syms.sh — DYNAMIC CALL COUNT FOR *ARBITRARY* SYMBOLS, PRE-PORT.
#
# Minted s217 (2026-07-29).  Closes the scope gap named in GOAL-SNOBOL4-RTX.md:
# util_rtx_arm_census.sh derives its symbol list from RTX_FUNC(...) names in
# src/runtime/rtx/*.s, so it can only see symbols that are ALREADY ported — it
# is the POST-port confirmation.  ARCH §7 step 0(d) has to run BEFORE any asm is
# written, on a symbol that is still pure C and therefore invisible to that
# tool.  This script takes the symbol names on the command line instead of
# deriving them, so it works at any stage.
#
# It answers 0(d) ONLY (entries to a symbol, and whether the count SCALES).  It
# CANNOT answer 0(f) pre-port: with no c_* fallback in the tree yet there is no
# bail edge to count, so a symbol with cold arms still reads as pure entries.
# 0(f) pre-port remains a source-reading obligation — read the C body and prove
# the arms, then confirm with util_rtx_arm_census.sh after the port lands.
#
# FIXED s221 (2026-07-29) — THE rc=139 SEGFAULT ON rt_dcap_lazy_init.  Root cause
# was NOT "an invalid RTLD_NEXT resolution" as the ladder guessed: resolution had
# not happened AT ALL yet.  glibc initialises libscrip_rt.so (a DT_NEEDED of
# scrip) BEFORE it runs an LD_PRELOAD object's constructor, so a symbol called
# during the runtime's own init reaches this thunk while real_<sym> is still 0 and
# `jmp qword ptr [rip+real_<sym>]` jumps to address 0.  Proof: a diagnostic build
# whose constructor printed on entry produced NO output before the crash.  The
# fix is lazy self-resolution IN the thunk (test real_, resolve on first call,
# then forward), preserving the full SysV argument set — the 6 integer arg regs,
# rax (varargs count), r10 (static chain), r11, and xmm0-7 — so it still forwards
# ANY signature without knowing it.  Push count is ODD by design (9) so rsp is
# 16-byte aligned at the `call`.  The constructor is RETAINED as a fast path for
# symbols that are not called that early; the EARLY-INIT column reports which
# symbols resolved lazily, so a future session sees WHY a symbol was special
# instead of rediscovering it.  A symbol with no downstream definition now aborts
# LOUDLY rather than jumping to NULL.
#
# Machinery is lifted verbatim from util_rtx_arm_census.sh (s216) so its three
# hard-won defect fixes are inherited rather than re-earned:
#   * counters are visibility("hidden") => `inc [rip+cnt]` is legal inside a .so
#     (an exported data symbol would need @GOTPCREL — ARCH §7 step 0(c))
#   * the thunk is `inc` + `jmp *ptr`: clobbers EFLAGS only, never an argument
#     register, so it forwards ANY signature without knowing it
#   * arming is conditional on libscrip_rt.so being loaded in THIS process,
#     because scrip's run spawns a second process with no runtime whose
#     destructor would otherwise overwrite the census with zeros
#
# Usage: bash scripts/util_rtx_count_syms.sh <prog.sno> <sym> [sym...]
#        SCRIP_RTX_<FAM> env vars pass through.
#        COUNTSYMS_IN=<file> feeds the program's stdin (default /dev/null).
#
# ⛔ THE STDIN REDIRECT IS LOAD-BEARING (added s221, after a 500 s timeout).  As
# minted this line had NO redirect at all, so scrip inherited the caller's stdin.
# On any program that slurps stdin via plain INPUT -- json.sno is the one in the
# tree, and its own line 262 says raw mode "never signals EOF under scrip, so it
# spins forever" -- the measurement HANGS instead of failing, which reads as "the
# tool is slow" rather than "the tool is wrong".  RULES.md line 80 already
# mandated `< /dev/null` on scrip calls; this is the same defect the s220
# kill-switch gate had, inverted (there stdin leaked IN and swallowed a find
# list; here its absence hung the run).  Default is /dev/null per that rule, and
# COUNTSYMS_IN is the explicit opt-in for the stdin-driven case -- 0(d) on
# json.sno genuinely needs `COUNTSYMS_IN=twitter.json`, so a blanket redirect
# would have removed a measurement the ladder depends on.
