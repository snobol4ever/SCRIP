# test_gate_p7_prolog_setjmp_gone.sh -- the DONE-WHEN of P7 (PROLOG REDESIGN, ARCH-PROLOG-THREE-ZETAS.md § 4; hq_P).
#
# ⭐ WHAT P7 DELETES, and why it is a deletion rather than a fix: Prolog failure and cut are control, and control belongs on the PORTS. Failure is β and cut is ω -- wired jumps decided at compile
# time -- so the C machinery that implements them by unwinding the C stack has no job left. Section 4's row: the three live setjmp barriers, g_plw_unwind_floor, g_plw_floor_bypass,
# rt_plw_floor_bypass_on, dop_call_nothrow and its two wrappers, at by_name_dispatch.c:1486-1600, 4872-4875, 4911, 5064.
#
# ⛔ IT GRADES BOTH HALVES, BECAUSE EITHER ALONE IS PASSABLE BY A CHANGE THAT DID NOT HAPPEN: the symbol must be gone from src/ AND absent from `nm -D out/libscrip_rt.so`. A source deletion that
# leaves an exported symbol means something still links it; an unexported symbol still named in src/ means the deletion was cosmetic. The section 4 form is "absent from src/ AND from nm -D" for
# exactly this reason and it is followed here literally.
#
# ⛔⛔ AND IT GRADES "BOARDS NOT WORSE" WITH THE INSTRUMENT THAT CAN ACTUALLY SAY SO. Deleting a stack-unwinding barrier is precisely the change that converts a caught corruption into a crash, so
# the van Roy board is not decoration here -- it is the safety half of this row. ⛔ It is called through test_gate_vanroy_prolog_acceptance.sh, which grades REFUSE 0 **and** CRASH 0 **and** a pinned
# CLEAN floor over worst-of-N: a bare "REFUSE 0" would be SATISFIED by these very deletions turning refusals into crashes (.github FINDING 5c7d2254). Do not swap it for a cheaper check.
# ⭐ SEQUENCING: P7 lands AFTER PZ-4 → PZ-5 → C36 (§ 6). Before the frame exists, deleting the barrier removes the only thing catching the corruption -- the board would get worse and this gate
# would correctly say so. A red here BEFORE the frame lands is the sequence being violated, not the cure being wrong.
