"""util_mem_scope.py -- ONE CGROUP SCOPE BOUNDS RESIDENT MEMORY AT THE OUTERMOST RUNNER, AND A CGROUP KILL IS A
REFUSAL, NEVER A RED (row instrument-698-runners-bound-the-clock-and-zero-bound-memory-one-cgroup-scope-bounds-
resident-pages-and-a-cgroup-kill-is-a-refusal-not-a-red, the ceo's ruling on the cfo's measurement; the coo 2026-09-23).

THE ASYMMETRY IT CLOSES: 698 files under scripts/ bounded the WALL CLOCK and zero bounded MEMORY, on one box shared by
ten seats. The cfo measured one process at 23,343 MB RSS eighteen seconds in, with 1 GB left on a 30 GB box, and three
of their background jobs were reaped as a direct consequence -- the cost of an unbounded runaway is ANOTHER SEAT'S JOBS.

⛔ THE SHAPE IS RULED: BOUND THE SCOPE, NOT THE CALL. A cgroup scope is inherited by every child, so ONE scope at the
OUTERMOST invocation bounds everything beneath it. Three entry points enter it, each through enter() below and nowhere
else: lib_one_runner.sh (every board runner that sources it from its own top), run_blocking_set.sh (make test, on the
real declaration) and corpus_suite_harness.py run (on a corpus population). A nested runner finds itself inside the
scope already and enters nothing.

⭐ THE MECHANISM, EVERY PROPERTY LOAD-BEARING AND EACH MEASURED ON THIS BOX (systemd 255, cgroup v2):
  systemd-run --user --scope -p MemoryMax=<cap> -p MemorySwapMax=0 -p OOMPolicy=continue
  - MemoryMax bounds RESIDENT pages; the collector's 4096 MB PROT_NONE MAP_NORESERVE reserve is address space and passes
    untouched (a real witness under a 256 MB cap is rc=0). ⛔ ulimit -v / RLIMIT_AS are FORBIDDEN: they count reserved
    address space, so the reserve aborts the process before its first line (the cfo tested it and retracted it).
  - MemorySwapMax=0 is MANDATORY: under MemoryMax alone a 512 MB allocation at a 256 MB cap SUCCEEDED BY SWAPPING
    (rc=0, "allocated 536870912") -- a runaway would degrade every seat without ever tripping the cap.
  - OOMPolicy=continue is MANDATORY and it is the coo's addition, measured 2026-09-23: under the default policy systemd
    STOPS THE WHOLE SCOPE after the kernel kills the runaway, so the supervisor below dies with it (rc=143, SIGTERM) and
    nothing is left to read memory.events or to say what happened -- the kill would reach the caller as a TERM, a
    phantom red. With continue, the kernel kills only its victim and the supervisor survives to classify it.
  - After the scope ends, systemd 255 forgets it (show -p Result reads "success", MemoryPeak "[not set]"), so the peak
    and the kill count are read INSIDE the scope, by supervise(), before it exits.

⛔ A CGROUP KILL IS COULD-NOT-MEASURE, THE rc=2 FAMILY, NEVER A RED (the ceo's clause): the supervisor exits 2 naming
the cap and the peak; corpus_suite_harness._run_raw grades a program the cgroup killed UNPROVEN, not CRASH; the blocking
set refuses an arm whose window saw a kill; util_score_row.py writes no row over a run a kill cut.

⭐ THE CAP IS DERIVED, NOT GUESSED -- see CAP_MB below for the measured high-water each default rests on and its
headroom. S4E_MEM_CAP_MB overrides it for one run and the supervisor's line says so.

# ⭐ THE DEFAULT CAPS, DERIVED (the coo 2026-09-23, clean origin bda7691cc, load 10-24 on 16 cores). Each is a measured
# tree-wide high-water -- the cgroup's own memory.peak, the object the cap bounds, never one process's maxrss (CEO-1136) --
# times a stated headroom, rounded up to a whole GB. Both measured numbers are declared here, as the row requires.
#   blocking-set: `make test` (411 arms, six shards) inside one uncapped scope peaked at 6322 MB (anon high-water 5927 MB,
#     page cache 1574 MB), and THAT PEAK WAS A SCHEDULING ACCIDENT: each arm alone in its own scope showed one arm at 4556 MB
#     (progress_configuration_declarations_do_not_regress -- util_progress_flips.py --ratchet holding the whole live progress
#     table, 619 MB / 4.13M rows) and seven at 684-716 MB (the util_suite_banner.py load behind every score-row write), every
#     other arm under 215 MB, and the serial phase's GC and timing arms under 296 MB together. The 4556 MB arm is therefore
#     DECLARED SERIAL in blocking_set_serial_arms.txt, so the worst case is max(4556 alone, six banner arms at once = 4296)
#     = 4.6 GB, and the cap is 2x that: 10 GB.
#   board: no lane's board peak is on record but the Pascal master's 81,572 KB (hq_pascal, CEO-1136); the heaviest step a
#     board takes that this seat can measure is its row write's banner load, 716 MB, and the heaviest SCRIP workloads in the
#     tree (the serial GC arms) stay under 296 MB. With less known, the headroom is larger -- 4x 716 MB -- so 3 GB.
# ⛔ BOTH GROW WITH THE PROGRESS TABLE (about 4 percent a day), so at that rate the blocking-set worst case reaches its cap in
#   about three weeks: the cure is those two readers streaming the table, and the caps are re-derived from the peaks every
#   scoped run now prints (the supervisor's line) the day either reader changes or a lane's board reports a heavier peak.
# ⭐ LATER THE SAME DAY THE TWO READERS STREAMED (the coo, CEO-1212): 4556 MB -> 14 MB and 716 MB -> 146 MB, answers identical
#   (test_gate_progress_readers_stream_and_answer_the_same.sh), and the 4556 MB arm left the serial list. Both caps are therefore
#   LOOSE now, never tight: they stand until the next scoped make test prints its peak ([mem_scope] ... peak=), and the re-derivation
#   uses that number, not these.
# ⛔⭐ THE BOARD CAP IS RE-DERIVED FOR SPITBOL'S DEFAULTS (ceo CEO-1261, 2026-09-25): every program may now reach SPITBOL's -d128m
#   heap where the 3 GB above was derived under a 4 MB default cap, and the SWI board -- twelve parallel jobs, each a scrip process
#   beside its swipl oracle -- reached peak=3072 MB and lost a process to the cgroup kill on its first pass at the new default (the
#   row was refused, as it must be). Twelve jobs x (128 MB of heap + stack and image) + twelve oracles is about 4 GB; the cap is 2x that.
