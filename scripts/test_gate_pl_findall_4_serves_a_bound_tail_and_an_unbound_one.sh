# findall/4's FOURTH ARGUMENT IS READ AS AN INPUT AND BOUND AS AN OUTPUT, and one operand kind serves both halves only
# because the runtime dereferences the tail WHEN IT IS BOUND and keeps the reference when it is not. Each half fails on
# its own, and THE TWO HALVES FAIL ON DIFFERENT WITNESSES, which is the whole reason this gate has two blocks:
#   the LOWERING half  -- a value read (IR_VAR) of an UNBOUND tail is detached from the slot, so the unification that
#                         should bind Tail binds a copy and Tail stays unbound. Fails on the STATIC shapes below.
#   the RUNTIME half   -- a raw reference consed onto the solutions keeps a pointer into the activation frame, so a
#                         BOUND tail reads back as whatever goal later reused that slot: a tail that spells itself 'nl'.
# ⛔ THE RUNTIME HALF IS INVISIBLE TO EVERY STATIC SHAPE, AND THIS GATE'S FIRST CUT PROVED IT THE HARD WAY -- it shipped
# with seven static witnesses, went GREEN against a tree with the deref removed, and was a false green for the exact
# defect it was written to pin. The frame slot is only reused early enough to be observed when the goal is META-CALLED
# THROUGH A VARIABLE (pl_meta_call_dyn): `run(G) :- call(G)`, `catch(G,_,true)`, or a goal built into a variable first.
# `call((findall(...), ...))` on a LITERAL conjunction is lowered statically and does NOT reproduce it -- which is also
# why the row that found this symptom mis-attributed it to the static meta path.
# ⛔ AND logtalk_iso CANNOT SEE THE RUNTIME HALF EITHER: --group findall_4 reads 15/15 with the tail consed raw, so the
# trade is invisible to the suite and a seat grading only the suite would land it.
# The expectation is CUT FROM THE ORACLE at run time, never from our own output, and both modes must print it.
