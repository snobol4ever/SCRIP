#!/usr/bin/env bash
# A match-with-REPLACEMENT whose subject needs a post-match store chain (an ARRAY ELEMENT, a TABLE element) leaves
# that chain's spine carve unreleased at the statement's gamma exit.  zd_exit_pop_s() released down to the MATCH
# watermark, which is the right answer only when nothing outlives the match region -- true for a plain-variable
# subject, whose one post-match slot IR_MATCH_REPLACE frees itself, and false the moment a store chain follows.
# TWO FACES, ONE DEFECT, and the gate grades both because either alone reads as a different bug:
#   (1) inside a DEFINE body the leaked spine is consumed by :(RETURN), which reads its port off a corrupted rsp
#       and jumps to a non-code address -- SIGSEGV in both modes, the four gimpel drivers hq_S rowed.
#   (2) at top level the same statement prints the RIGHT ANSWER and leaks per execution, so it is invisible to
#       every answer-grading arm we own and only a capacity arm can see it.
# The loop arm therefore pins its OWN ulimit -s in a subshell: an environment variable that decides the verdict is
# part of the criterion or the criterion is not one.
