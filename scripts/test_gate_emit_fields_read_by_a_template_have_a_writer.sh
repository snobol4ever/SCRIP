#
# WHAT IT GATES.  A FIELD WITH A READER AND NO WRITER IS INVISIBLE.  `g_emit` (emit.h) is the one
# channel from the emitter's per-node prepare into the x86 templates: the drive in emit.cpp WRITES
# `g_emit.op_*`, and a template READS the same field as `_.op_*`.  When a landing deletes the write
# and leaves the read, NOTHING SAYS SO: it compiles clean, the field still greps as present-and-used,
# and the template's own ternary default supplies a plausible answer forever.
#
# ⛔ THE MEASURED CASE THIS GATE EXISTS FOR (hq_B's bisect, 2026-09-10).  The cfo's cset-bit-table
# PERF landing `539af6946` also deleted three lines that were not perf, among them the assignment of
# the activation's procedure name into `g_emit.op_activate_proc`.  `op_activate_proc` stayed DECLARED
# in emit.h and READ by bb_activate, and was WRITTEN BY NOBODY.  Every co-expression activation trace
# event then fell to the template's `main` default: 67 of arizona transmit.std's 104 lines named
# `main` where the oracle names `output`, `word` and `reader`, and 28 of those also carried the
# enclosing `while` line instead of the activation site's own.  Nothing failed to build.  The cure was
# `4257407de`; this gate is the cheap census that would have caught it AT LANDING TIME rather than
# after a bisect, and it is a grep, not a run: no build, no oracle, no corpus.
#
# ⭐ WHY A PINNED FLOOR AND NOT ZERO.  Three fields are read with no writer TODAY and are not this
# defect: they are dead weight from templates the driver no longer reaches.  Deleting them is a
# separate cleanup with its own control arms, so they are named here and the census may not GROW
# past them.  Lower the floor in the commit that removes one; never raise it.
#
#   op_bounded     — read once (a template arm gated on it, so the arm never fires)
#   op_kind        — read once; the only assignment anywhere is emit_per_kind_audit.c setting it NULL
#   op_parts_lbl   — read by bb_idx_get (a template bb_templates.h declares and emit.cpp never calls)
#                    and by three gvar-arith arms whose IF therefore never fires
#
# ⛔ HOW TO CONTROL-ARM IT, AND THE WRONG WAY THAT LOOKS RIGHT.  Remove every writer of a field and it
# must go RED naming that field.  ⛔ Rename the write to a name that SHARES ITS PREFIX and the census
# still sees it: the pattern takes the longest run of [a-z0-9_], so `g_emit.op_activate_procZZ` yields
# the token `op_activate_proc` and the gate stays green.  That is how this gate first "passed" its own
# control arm; rename to something disjoint (`g_emit.op_zzdead`) instead.  Measured green-then-red on
# `op_activate_proc` 2026-09-10 before wiring.
#
# ⛔ WHAT IT CANNOT SEE.  A field written on ONE drive path and read on ANOTHER is still invisible on
# the second path; this gate only proves that SOMEBODY writes it somewhere.  It is a floor under the
# whole class, not a proof for any one node.
