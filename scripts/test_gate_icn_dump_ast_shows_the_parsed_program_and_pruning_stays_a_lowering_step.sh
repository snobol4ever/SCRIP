# test_gate_icn_dump_ast_shows_the_parsed_program_and_pruning_stays_a_lowering_step.sh -- --dump-ast prints what was parsed even when no procedure is reachable from main, and the unreachable-procedure prune still happens for a single Icon compiland but never across languages (ceo CEO-658).
#
# MEASURED 2026-09-13 on ea0c83883: 13 of the Icon master's ast-graded entries printed NOTHING under --dump-ast
# (procedure_write_89/91/92/94, procedure_36/40/43, procedure_suspend_1, procedure_fail_write_1,
# procedure_suspend_write_1/2, procedure_every_to_replace_6, procedure_every_suspend_5) -- every one a program with no
# `main`. icn_prune_unreachable_procs ran inside icon_compile, in the FRONTEND, keeping only what is reachable from main
# or invocable; with no main it emptied the program before the dump. The same call also emptied the Icon block of a
# polyglot program, whose caller lives in another language: test_smoke_polyglot.sh was a STANDING RED (0/2 both modes,
# "TRI: DOUBLE(21) = 42" missing) for exactly this reason. Cure: the prune is a LOWERING step -- the driver calls it
# before RECORD_SEG and only when the program is ONE source file; the polyglot path never calls it.
# ARMS: (1) three no-main programs dump their parse; (2) an unreachable procedure is still absent from a single-file
# compiland's emitted asm (the optimization is not silently deleted); (3) a procedure called from another language
# survives -- run through test_smoke_polyglot.sh's own witnesses. FAIL_ONCE=1 empties the first dump.
