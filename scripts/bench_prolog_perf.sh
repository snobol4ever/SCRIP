# bench_prolog_perf.sh — ANGLE 3 of the Prolog three-angle triangulation: THE PROCESS WRAPPER.
#
# TWO BASES, PRINTED SEPARATELY AND NEVER SUBTRACTED ACROSS (RULES.md FACT RULE, apples-to-apples):
#
#   (A) PROCESS TOTALS, wall ms, median of RUNS, over the PRISTINE kernel — the table this harness has
#       always printed.  Columns: GNU (gprolog --consult-file, bytecode consult mode) · SWI (swipl -q -g
#       halt, script mode) · m3 (scrip --run: in-process x86 codegen + execution, end to end) · m4r (the
#       precompiled scrip --compile binary, execution only) · m4c (scrip --compile + as + gcc, one-shot
#       compile+link).  Single-shot, so small entries are startup-dominated — stated up front, and that
#       IS this angle's subject: m4c exists on no other angle.
#
#   (B) ⭐ THE TWO-NUMBER WORK/OVERHEAD BASIS, over the GENERATED WRAPPED FORM — the CEO-567 DONE-WHEN
#       clause "the three angles run over the wrapped form with the process wrapper's numbers printed
#       beside the self-measured ones".  Angle 1 (test_bench_prolog_timed.sh) and angle 2
#       (bench_prolog_fixed_iter.sh) have carried these two grids since 2026-09-13; this angle was the
#       last of the three without them, so the row's own DONE-WHEN could not close.  ELAPSED comes from
#       tools/bench_rusage OUTSIDE the process, WORK from the generated bracket INSIDE it, and
#       OVERHEAD is the difference — the startup + consult/codegen + teardown the kernel never did,
#       which on a single-shot angle is most of the wall clock and is the whole point of measuring here.
#
# ⛔⛔ (A) AND (B) MEASURE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS AND A READER MUST NOT SUBTRACT ONE FROM THE OTHER.
#   (A) runs corpus/benchmarks/prolog/bench/<k>.pl verbatim; (B) runs the generated wrapper, which for a
#   rival also inlines its prelude (wall_us/1, wall_ms/1).  The two differ by a timing bracket and, on
#   gnu/swi, by a consulted prelude.  Each table states its own program; neither is the other's control.
#
# ⛔ THE PAIR IN (B) COMES FROM ONE RUN, NEVER FROM TWO MEDIANS.  OVERHEAD = ELAPSED − WORK is a
#   difference taken inside a single process; median-of-elapsed and median-of-work can come from
#   different runs, and their difference is then a number no process ever exhibited.  So the runs are
#   ranked by ELAPSED and the MEDIAN RUN's own (elapsed, work) pair is what is printed — both cells of a
#   row are the same process, always.
#
# ⛔⛔ WALL MINUS WALL (the same law angles 1 and 2 carry).  bench_rusage reports BOTH elapsed_ns
#   (CLOCK_MONOTONIC) and user_us+sys_us (CPU); wall_us/1 inside the bracket is CLOCK_MONOTONIC.  So
#   OVERHEAD uses elapsed_ns and never the CPU pair — subtracting across the two instruments publishes
#   the difference of two clocks as an overhead, and goes NEGATIVE on a loaded box, which is the tell.
#
# ⛔⭐ THE CLOCK FLOOR IS A REFUSAL, NOT A FOOTNOTE (hq_P's ruling to the ceo, row CEO-567 conversion).
#   gprolog's wall_us is real_time/1 × 1000 — a UNIT CONVERSION of a 1 ms tick, which prelude_gplc.pl
#   says in its own header.  On this angle the work is ONE iteration, so most kernels' true work is far
#   under one gnu tick: MEASURED here, gnu reports work_us=0 for query.  A zero silently moves the whole
#   elapsed into the OVERHEAD column and reads as "this engine did no work", which is readable and
#   wrong.  A cell whose work is under FLOOR_TICKS ticks of ITS OWN engine's clock therefore prints
#   TICK-FLOOR(<what it read>) in both grids: what it read, and no number built on it.
#   ⭐ A TICK-FLOOR CELL IS A MEASUREMENT, NOT A DARK CELL, and it does not make the grid refuse -- the
#   caller knows its subject is below its instrument and says so in its own words, which is precisely the
#   case lib_perf_fmt.sh THE DARK-CELL LAW exempts.  Counting it would also refuse this grid on every run
#   for a permanent and correct reason, and a verdict that is always red is a verdict nobody reads.
#   ⭐ That refusal is this angle's honest finding, not its failure: one iteration is below gprolog's
#   resolution BY CONSTRUCTION, which is exactly why angles 1 and 2 loop N times before dividing.
#
# Only programs whose 4-way CORRECTNESS is consensus-green are timed; a FAIL in any engine prints SKIP
# for that row (timing wrong answers is meaningless).
