# test_gate_pas_two_routines_of_one_name_get_distinct_assembler_labels.sh -- a program that declares two routines with the same name (an
# overload pair differing in result type, or a routine nested inside one of its own name) assembles in mode 4 and runs, as fpc's.
#
# MEASURED 2026-10-04 by hq_pascal on FPC test_tover7 and webtbs_tw24129: mode 3 passed (the duplicate went unnoticed) and mode 4 died in the
# assembler, `symbol FN__test is already defined`, because every graph's labels derive from its routine's bare name.
#
# CURE: lower_pascal_stage2 renames the table entry of a routine whose name an earlier entry already holds to name$dup<index> after its graph is
# lowered, so its labels are distinct; the graph's own body (built before the rename) keeps its result variable. LIMIT, stated and not claimed: a CALL
# still resolves by the bare name to the first routine, so a nested routine that shadows an outer one WITH BODIES still calls the outer one in both modes
# (it called the inner one in mode 3 before) -- scope-correct resolution of shadowed and overloaded names is a separate mechanism (this parser has no
# `overload` directive and keys its routine tables by bare name).
#
# ARMS, both modes, expectations cut LIVE from fpc: (over) the tover7 shape, same scope, differing result types; (nest) the tw24129 shape, a routine
# nested twice inside routines of its own name. FAIL_ONCE=1 corrupts the nest arm's ref.
