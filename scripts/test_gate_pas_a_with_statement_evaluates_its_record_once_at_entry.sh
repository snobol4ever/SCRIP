# test_gate_pas_a_with_statement_evaluates_its_record_once_at_entry.sh -- the record-variable of a with-statement is accessed once, before the statement, and every field name in the body refers to that record however the body changes the pointer or the index (ISO 7185 6.8.3.10).
#
# MEASURED 2026-10-09 by hq_pascal against fpc -Miso: `with p^ do begin p := next; writeln(n) end` printed the second record's n where fpc prints the first's, in both modes, because every field reference in the body cloned the selector `p^` and so re-read p; the same for `with a[i] do begin i := 2; n := 5 end`
# (the write went to a[2]), for a nested `with p^, next^`, and for `with g, g.t^ do begin t := nx; ... nx ... end`. Found running Pascal-P5's compiler: pcom's `with gattr, typtr^ do ... typtr := eltype; ... taggedrec(eltype)` read the new record's field, so every tagged record behind a pointer got the plain
# `chka` check where the native compiler emits `ckla`, and the P-code differed from the native compiler's.
# CURE (pascal.y only; no new global): pas_with_capture rewrites the selector of each with element so that the pointer of a dereference and the index of an array element are read once into hidden per-routine locals (__pas_wpN, pas_local_add, so a recursive routine's activations do not share them;
# a pointer temporary is registered with the target record type so the field names still resolve) before the statement; pas_with_finish emits those assignments ahead of the body. The original selector stays on the with stack for the 6.5.4 dispose check.
#
# ARMS, both modes: two controls cut LIVE from fpc -Miso that must be byte-identical: a list walk that moves the pointer inside `with p^`, an array element whose index changes inside `with a[i]`, a nested `with p^, next^` and a body that sets the pointer to nil; and a variant record reached through a
# record field that the body reassigns (`with g, g.t^ do begin t := nx; ... end`). FAIL_ONCE=1 corrupts the first control's ref.
