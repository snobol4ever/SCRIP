# test_gate_pas_record_variables_are_scoped_to_their_procedure.sh -- a record variable declared in a procedure does not leak into the next procedure
#
# MEASURED 2026-09-13 by the coo on origin 24f1ec353, while taking the P5 self-host row: the parser's record-variable
# table was keyed by NAME ALONE, with no scope, and every lookup took the FIRST entry it found. Pascal-P5's pint.pas
# declares a local "var r: record ..." in eight different procedures, so putrel's "r.r := f" resolved against putint's
# "r", found no field called r there, fell through as an unresolved raw field node, and the lowerer dereferenced a NULL
# name: SCRIP SEGFAULTED compiling pint.pas, in mode 3 and mode 4 alike. A thirty-line witness reproduces it with two
# procedures. This is a CRASH, not a wrong answer, and it stood between SCRIP and the second Pascal milestone.
#
# Cure, entirely in the Pascal frontend: the record-variable table gets the same scope stack the pointer-variable table
# has had all along -- marked at pv_mark, released at every one of the five procedure and function exits -- and its three
# name lookups scan NEWEST FIRST so an inner declaration shadows an outer one for as long as it is in scope. The lowerer
# also stops dereferencing a NULL assignment target, so a future unresolved name is a bad program, never a segfault.
#
# ARMS: one program in both modes, byte-identical to fpc -Miso. A global record variable r, then three procedures each
# declaring their OWN local r with different fields (a variant record, a record whose field shares the variable's name,
# and a two-char record), then the global r read again after all three return to prove the outer declaration survived.
# On the parent tree this witness DUMPS CORE. FAIL_ONCE=1 corrupts the first line to prove the diff arm trips.
