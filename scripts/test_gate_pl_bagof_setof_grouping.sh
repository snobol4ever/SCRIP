# test_gate_pl_bagof_setof_grouping.sh — bagof/3 and setof/3 group by their FREE VARIABLES and share variable
# IDENTITY with the caller (ladder rung 8b; row prolog-inria-bagof-setof-free-var-identity-and-grouping-broken,
# hq_R 2026-09-07).
#
# WHAT THIS PINS. ISO/IEC 13211-1 § 8.10.2 / § 8.10.3. bagof/setof are NOT findall-with-a-sort: the variables of the
# Goal that appear neither in the Template nor under a `^` are the WITNESS, and the builtin backtracks once per
# distinct witness binding, yielding that group's Templates. SCRIP shipped them as literally findall + "fail if
# empty" + "sort" — no witness was computed, nothing was grouped, and `^` was a rung-8 compile refusal. Two visible
# consequences, both cured here:
#   (1) IDENTITY. bagof(X,(X=Y;X=Z),L) must bind L to the CALLER's Y and Z cells, so a later Y=hello, Z=world makes
#       L == [hello,world]. SCRIP returned two fresh unrelated variables and the later bindings never reached L.
#   (2) GROUPING. setof(1,(Y=2;Y=1),_) must backtrack over Y, binding it to 1 and to 2. SCRIP never bound it at all.
#
# ⛔⭐ GROUPING IS BY VARIANT, NOT BY `==`, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE DIFFICULTY. In bagof(X,(X=Y;X=Z),L) BOTH solutions
# carry a witness that is a pair of distinct fresh variables. Those two witnesses are NOT `==` (different variable
# identities), so an `==` grouping splits them into two groups and answers [Y] and [Z] — plausible, and wrong. They
# ARE variants, so the cure needed a real variant test; the engine had no `=@=`, and one was written for this
# (rt_pl_variant_cells, a structural walk carrying a variable BIJECTION, in unification.c).
#
# ⛔ THE CALLER'S WITNESS IS UNIFIED WITH **EVERY** MEMBER OF THE GROUP, NOT WITH THE GROUP'S FIRST WITNESS. Each
# solution is copied independently (findall's collector freshens variables per item), so each member's Template
# refers to ITS OWN copy's cells. Unifying only the representative leaves every later member's Template dangling —
# measured: it produced bagof_fail on ARM A's first row while every other row passed. Unifying all members coalesces
# the copies onto the caller's cells, which is what makes identity work.
#
# ⭐ ARM D IS THE REGRESSION CONTROL AND IT IS THE POINT OF THE WHOLE DESIGN: findall/3 must go on IGNORING free
# variables (findall(X,(X=Y;X=Z),L) is two fresh variables, never a group), and bagof with NO free variables must
# keep its old behaviour. The lowering therefore takes the witness path ONLY when the free-variable set is non-empty,
# so every program without free variables keeps its previous codegen — that is the blast-radius control, stated as a
# test rather than as an intention.
#
# ⛔ EVERY EXPECTATION IS ORACLE-CUT from BOTH swipl 9.x and gprolog 1.4.5, measured 2026-09-07 through a CONSULTED
# FILE. The two agree exactly on every row this gate counts.
