# test_gate_icn_the_cset_registry_is_weak_so_a_dead_computed_cset_leaves_the_collector.sh -- hq_icon, 2026-09-24, MODE DECTET.
#
# WHAT WAS THERE. The cset registry (keywords.c) keeps a cset's length and bits keyed by its pointer, and kw_cset_intern
# appends every DISTINCT computed cset to it. kw_cset_gc_roots rooted every entry, so a computed cset never died: deal
# -h 1000 m4 on 8b6cb3607 ended with about 3000 of them, and at the shipped 128 KB window each of about 3600 collections
# visited, marked, slot-registered and slid all of them -- 1248 ms of CPU against iconx's 38, 40 percent of it under
# kw_cset_gc_roots (perf, the generic-kernel binary).
#
# WHAT IS HERE. The unnamed entries are WEAK. kw_cset_gc_roots roots only the named keyword csets; once per collection,
# after the mark drain and before forwarding, gc_collect_ex calls kw_cset_gc_weak, which keeps and slot-registers an
# entry whose block is marked (or is not in the heap) through rt_gc_weak_keep and tombstones the rest (ptr NULL, so no
# forwarding, index rebuild or content probe ever reads it); the registry compacts and re-indexes on its next lookup.
# A cset is a value: an unnamed interned result no root reaches is unobservable, and the next intern of the same content
# makes a fresh block holding the same value (the cto's ruling on the ASK, CEO-812 permits it: no conservative visit).
#
# ARMS. (1) deal -h 1000 answers byte-identical to iconx in both media at the shipped window. (2) The plant
# SCRIP_GC_PLANT_CSET_STRONG=1 restores the strong rooting, proves it applied by its once-per-process line, and still
# answers identically. (3) RETENTION DOES NOT GROW WITH WORK: under SCRIP_GC_STRESS=1 (a collection at every opportunity, so the
# live set at exit is exact and no pacing enters it) the weak run's live blocks at exit are EQUAL at -h 50 and -h 100 and the
# plant's GROW (ceo 2026-09-25, CEO-1264: this arm read the plant's collection count against 3x the weak run's, and that was the
# half-window pacing's thrash -- since the collector spends a window before collecting it and grows one that a collection leaves
# under 15 percent free, a retaining registry gets a larger window instead of more collections: 230 weak vs 384 plant at 128 KB,
# 823 vs 428 at 64 KB, while the stress-1 reading is 524 blocks weak at both hands vs 1065 -> 1410 plant, identical on the
# pre-pacing tree d566528fa), and (4) its live bytes at exit are
# higher -- both deterministic, read off the [GC-EXERCISE] line. (5) Its CPU (user+sys, bench_rusage) is at least 2x.
# Measured at landing (load 30-47, so CPU is quoted for its ratio only): weak 434 collections, 49856 live bytes, ~180 ms;
# plant 3020 collections, 172464 live bytes, ~2800 ms. Arms 3-5 are the plant proving the gate can see the regression.
# (6) THE TOMBSTONE IS NEVER READ: a witness that keeps some computed csets live in a list and a table, lets the rest die,
# and holds a NUL-carrying complement whose length only the registry knows, runs in both media under
# SCRIP_GC_PLANT_FLIP=1 at stress 1 -- every live block copied to disjoint ground and all old ground PROT_NONE, so a
# dangling registry entry read by forwarding, the index rebuild or a content probe FAULTS where it is used. Its answers
# must equal iconx's, the flip plant's proof line must print, and no [ZGC-STALE] report may appear (the cto's condition).
# Measured at landing: 11765 collections, 529 compactions that removed tombstones, about 3 s a medium.
# RUN FIRST THEN WIRED (CEO-381): on the control tree 8b6cb3607 (strong registry, no plant) arms 2-5 read RED.
