# test_gate_raku_zframe.sh — RK-ZC-8: Raku ζ-frame regime pin gate.
#
# DOCTRINE: lower_raku.c sets zframe_graph=1 on every Raku IR graph (RK-ZC-2, mirrors ICN-FR-2).
# This gate asserts two invariants so a future regime migration cannot silently leave Raku behind:
#
#   INVARIANT A — THE REGIME IS DERIVED AND LOAD-BEARING (RECUT 2026-09-16, hq_raku).
#   ⛔ THE KILLSWITCH FORM OF THIS ARM IS DEAD BY LAW, NOT BY CHOICE. It read: with SCRIP_RK_ZFRAME=0
#   both witnesses must exit nonzero. That switch was DELETED on 2026-09-09 by `709a755df` (CEO-447,
#   Lon 09-09 09:2x: "Get rid of enumerated shape class now!!!") along with the other 28 frame-placement
#   switches, and `test_gate_no_zeta_frame_switches.sh` was wired BLOCKING in the same commit to keep
#   every such name out of src/ forever. So the old arm could only be greened by re-adding a getenv that
#   a blocking gate exists to forbid: the two gates were in direct contradiction and the law wins.
#   ⭐ MEASURED, AND THE REASON THIS IS WRITTEN DOWN: with nothing reading the name, `SCRIP_RK_ZFRAME=0`
#   is an ordinary default-regime run. The witness ran CORRECTLY and exited 0, and the arm read that as
#   "zframe_graph not disabling correctly" — so this gate has been RED ON A CLEAN TREE since 2026-09-09,
#   for the seven days nobody ran it. An env switch is a TERRIBLE thing to pin a gate to: when the switch
#   is deleted, the gate does not refuse and does not go dark, it goes RED while the tree is perfectly
#   healthy, and it accuses the code of the instrument's own obsolescence.
#   WHAT REPLACES IT, keeping the content and dropping the switch: A1 is BEHAVIOURAL — the class-b witness
#   (a user sub called with an argument, the shape that needs the ζ-frame entry's γ/ω wires) must print
#   the right answer in BOTH modes; A2 is a SOURCE CENSUS — lower_raku.c must put every Raku graph on the
#   zframe regime UNCONDITIONALLY, with no getenv between the decision and the graph. A1 proves the regime
#   carries the construct; A2 proves it is derived, never selected. Neither can be satisfied by a switch.
#   Witness 1 (class a — ζ-cell ret-pop): `say 42;`  — correct output then SIGSEGV (rc nonzero).
#   Witness 2 (class b — no-return-wires): `sub f($a){return $a*2} say f(21);` — dies rc=1.
#
#   INVARIANT B — FULL SUITE CLEAN: with the default (zframe_graph=1), test_smoke_raku.sh exits 0.
#   This re-runs the suite rather than trusting the watermark so drift is caught the same session it
#   is introduced.
#
# Usage: bash scripts/test_gate_raku_zframe.sh
# Exit 0 = gate PASS.  Exit 1 = gate FAIL with reason.
