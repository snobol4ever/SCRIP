# ⭐ THE PROOF BEHIND CEO-571's UPPERCASE CONVERSION OF corpus/packages/snobol4/spitbol_x64_tests.
#
# WHY.  SPITBOL folds case by default; our one mandated arm is `sbl -bf` and `-f` turns folding OFF, because
# that is the arm SCRIP's case-sensitive SNOBOL4 matches (lib_oracle_flags.sh, s189).  29 of these 36 vendored
# programs are written in SPITBOL's lower-case idiom and `-bf` refused them with "No END statement found".
# CEO-571 ruled the cure is to convert the SOURCE in the repo, once -- never at grade time.  A conversion is
# only legitimate if it did not change what the program MEANS, and that is what this gate measures:
#
#   for every *.sbl in the package:   sbl ORIGINAL (folding, upstream's own invocation, vendored tree)
#                             vs      sbl -bf CURRENT (our converted tree)
#   must agree BYTE-FOR-BYTE on stdout AND stderr AND on the exit code.
#
# ⛔ rc ALONE IS NOT THE VERDICT.  Measured during CEO-571: the math tests changed one line each yet diverged,
# because their `-INCLUDE` was still lower case and the `-bf` run then printed NOTHING AT ALL while still
# exiting 0.  A silent empty run reads green to any check that only reads `$?`.  Hence stdout+stderr+rc.
#
# ⛔ EACH PROGRAM RUNS IN ITS OWN FRESH COPY OF ITS OWN TREE.  These programs write files into cwd (save.spx,
# module.out, arcput's archive, &dump output).  Sharing one run directory across programs makes a program's
# verdict depend on which programs ran before it, and the two arms do not hold the same files to begin with.
#
# ⛔ REFUSES (rc=2) rather than reporting a result it could not take: missing oracle, missing package, missing
# vendored baseline.  A test that cannot measure never reports green.

# ⛔⭐ ONE NAMED NORMALIZATION, AND IT EXISTS BECAUSE ONE PROGRAM PRINTS THINGS NO CASE CONVERSION CAN REACH.
# `gcbuster.sbl` sets `&DUMP = 1`, so SPITBOL dumps the symbol table and every keyword on exit.  Two cells in
# that dump are outside any source edit's reach, both MEASURED, not argued:
#   (1) `&CASE` IS THE FOLDING FLAG THE TWO ARMS DIFFER IN BY CONSTRUCTION -- the folding arm prints `&CASE = 1`
#       and the `-bf` arm prints `&CASE = 0`.  A program that reports the invocation cannot be made invariant
#       under the invocation; converting its source harder never closes this line.
#   (2) `BASEMEM` / `TOPMEM` are `HOST(-1,2)` / `HOST(-1,3)`, RAW HEAP ADDRESSES UNDER ASLR.  Measured: three
#       consecutive runs of the UNMODIFIED vendored source under the SAME binary print three different values,
#       so the ORIGINAL arm is not byte-identical TO ITSELF here.  No `.ref` could pin this either.
# ⛔ THE NORMALIZATION IS APPLIED TO BOTH ARMS, IS ANCHORED TO WHOLE LINES, AND IS PRINTED IN THE VERDICT -- a
# silent filter is how a gate stops measuring.  Everything else in that dump (all ten natural variable names,
# their values, the other 23 keywords) is compared byte-for-byte, which is what caught the user identifiers:
# under folding the dump reads `BASEMEM`, under `-bf` it read `basemem`, so gcbuster's user names ARE
# observable output and had to be converted too -- the one file in this package where that is true.
