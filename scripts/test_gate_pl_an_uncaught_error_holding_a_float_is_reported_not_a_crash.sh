# THE DEFECT (the cfo 2026-10-07, found working prolog-swi-ieee-float-flags-and-the-evaluables-ceil-lgamma-powm): a Prolog
# program whose goal raised an uncaught error died of SIGSEGV in mode 3 whenever the ball held a float -- in snprintf's
# aligned SSE store, under rt_pl_root_omega -> rt_pl_ball_report. The pinned root's omega wire was rt_pl_root_omega itself,
# a C function entered by a jump with no return address pushed, so its body ran 8 bytes off the ABI's alignment; the
# other roots' exit wires are naked stubs that align first. Mode 4's root omega called it without aligning either and
# survived only where the landing happened to be aligned.
# THE CURE: mode 3's wire is the naked stub pl_root_ω (and $-16, %rsp; push $0; jmp), mode 4's omega aligns before its call.
#
# Four programs x two modes: the report line swipl-style SCRIP prints, rc 2, never a signal.
# rc=0 clean · rc=1 a divergence · rc=2 REFUSAL.
