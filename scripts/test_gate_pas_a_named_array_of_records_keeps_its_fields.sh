# test_gate_pas_a_named_array_of_records_keeps_its_fields.sh -- a variable of a NAMED array-of-record type reads back its fields
#
# MEASURED 2026-09-23 by hq_pascal on SCRIP 70bea131d, both modes, row pascal-all-test-suites-of-the-language-read-100-percent-on-the-
# suite-table-the-home-stretch. A WRONG ANSWER, found writing a control for the 6.4.1 gate: with type row = array [1..3] of pt (pt a
# record), var r: row; r[2].v := 7; writeln(r[2].v:1) printed NOTHING in m3 at rc=0 while fpc -Miso prints 7, and var r: array
# [1..3] of pt printed 7. Cause, by diffing the two ASTs: simple_type's IDENT arm returned a named ARRAY type's bound and never loaded
# its element record's fields into the pending field list (pas_rectype_to_pend ran only in the non-array arm), so var_decl saw no
# fields, skipped the flattened array-of-record registration, and r[2].v became a generic TT_FIELD that reads nothing. type_decl had
# already registered row with pt's fields, so the arm now loads them too; the named form then builds the IDENTICAL AST to the inline
# form. No suite cell moved (no PAT, FPC, master or benchmark program declares a variable through a named array-of-record type).
# ⛔ NAMED, NOT CURED HERE: a record nested inside an arrayed record (r[2].b.x) still reads back empty -- its own landing.
#
# ARMS: one program cut LIVE from fpc -Miso and required byte-identical in BOTH modes (m4 compiles, links and runs): a two-field record
# in a named array type and in an alias of it, filled in a loop and read back. It FAILS on the parent tree. FAIL_ONCE=1 corrupts the
# ref to prove the arm can fail.
