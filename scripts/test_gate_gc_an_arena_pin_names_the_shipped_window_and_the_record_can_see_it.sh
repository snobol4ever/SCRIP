# ⛔⭐⭐ THE GATE THAT HOLDS THE CEO-1146 ARENA SWEEP, and it exists because the sweep's own census had neither a
# selftest nor a recipe that ran it -- the identical pair of holes COO-150 had just cured in util_gc_acceptance.py,
# one instrument later.
#
# WHAT THE SWEEP WAS.  Since CEO-1095 took the shipped arena to 128 KB (GC_HEAP_KB, compiled in, on Lon's word), the
# spelling `SCRIP_HEAP_MB=1` names a 1024 KB window -- EIGHT TIMES the window we ship.  Eighteen gates pinned it
# believing it tightened the arena.  MEASURED HERE over six witnesses at four arenas: MB=1 runs the collector ZERO
# times on four of them and once or twice on the other two, so those gates were grading their stress-0 arms with the
# collector switched off, and the cfo independently caught jcon args.icn reading collections=0 at MB=1 while it is
# RED at the shipped arena with collections=3 -- a live defect the mandated "tiny" arena is blind to.
#
# ⛔ WHY THE SHIPPED 128 KB AND NOT THE 64 KB FLOOR, which is where this sweep was first drafted and where the cto's
# nine went.  64 collects MORE on all six witnesses (50/11/2/1/3/80 against 22/3/1/0/1/26), so exasperation alone
# argues for it -- but on hb_bignum_length.icn a 64 KB pin reads grew=16 and the cfo measured grew=8 on args.icn:
# THE WINDOW GREW, so the run was not the size its own label claims.  A pin the runtime overrides is a false label,
# which is the exact defect class this row exists to close; I printed grew=16 in my own output and read past it, and
# the cfo's message is what sent me back to it.  The deciding law is the THIRTY-THIRD BATCH'S FIRST CLAUSE: the
# exasperation knob is STRESS, NEVER THE ARENA.  So the arena's job is to be the window we ship (CEO-939: a landing
# gate must grade what we ship; SCRIP_HEAP_KB_TINY is already 128; grew is 0 there on all six) and SCRIP_GC_STRESS
# does the exasperating.
#
# ARMS.  (a) the sweep is COMPLETE -- the census of record reads zero gates left to sweep.  (b) THE CENSUS PROVES
# ITSELF on a planted witness per spelling, because a DONE-WHEN that trusts a reader to say ZERO is only as good as
# that reader: the shipped regex read `=1` and `${VAR:-1}` but NOT `${VAR:=1}` and under-reported its own population
# by two gates.  (c) that selftest CAN FAIL.  (d) a KB-pinned run DECLARES ITS ARENA to the progress record -- it did
# not, and sweeping onto a knob the record cannot see would have traded a wrong arena for an invisible one.
# (e) THE KNOB IS A REQUEST AND COLLECTIONS ARE THE EVIDENCE (33rd batch clause 5), measured live on this binary.
# (f) the window the pin asks for is the window the runtime delivers -- grew=0, the disqualifier that chose 128.
# ⛔⭐ SINCE CEO-1261 (Lon 2026-09-25: "Let's set our default stack size and heap size for SCRIP to be the same as SPITBOL.") THE
# SHIPPED WINDOW IS SPITBOL'S -i1m, which is the 1024 KB an MB pin of 1 names, so the swept pins now name the GC-TESTING arena
# (the Makefile's SCRIP_HEAP_KB_TINY, 128 KB -- the literal 24 swept gates pin) rather than the shipped window: arms (e) and (f) read that
# arena out of the Makefile and grade it, and the shipped window is printed beside it, never repeated here.
