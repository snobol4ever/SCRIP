# ⛔⭐⭐ THE REFUSED ARM — A REFUSING PROGRAM'S COMMITTED .s IS A PRE-CUT SNAPSHOT, NOT AN ARTIFACT (hq_P 2026-09-02,
# ceo row regen-demo-s-artifacts-writes-a-refused-marker-for-a-refusing-program).  The graceful-skip above is right for a
# CRASH — a flaky failure must never erase a good .s — but it is WRONG for a construct-ladder REFUSAL, because a refusal
# is not a transient: the compiler ran, understood the program, and declined it by name.  Leaving the last-good .s in
# place then publishes asm that NO CURRENT COMPILER EMITS.  Measured at the rung-6 landing: the four Prolog demo .s
# carried 214 `rt_call_arr_bl` by-name calls that the by-name dispatcher no longer generates at all.
# ⭐ THE DISCRIMINATOR IS POSITIVE EVIDENCE IN STDERR, never an exit code: `is not on the ladder yet` is printed only by
# the ladder's own refusal path, exactly as util_regen_prolog_bench_s_artifacts.sh keys its .s.REFUSED arm (23 markers
# since rung 0).  Only THERE is the destructive delete of a committed .s legitimate.  Everything else — timeout, crash,
# empty emit, assembler-reject — keeps the graceful-skip and leaves the .s untouched.
# ⛔ THE MARKER IS SELF-RETIRING: the first run after that rung lands sees real asm, removes the marker and writes the
# .s, so the tree converges on honest output without anyone remembering to clean up.

# THE SANCTIONED SET (widened 2026-07-26 by Lon directive: "get them all but porter stemmer can be excluded";

# Was the s151 five (roman wordcount claws5 treebank-list treebank-array) — which silently left hello.s and four
# other legacy artifacts frozen at 2026-06-25 while the compiler moved a month underneath them, and left the ten
# s158 working-set programs with no artifact at all.  TWO PROGRAMS ARE DELIBERATELY ABSENT ON SIZE, NOT ON
# HEALTH — porter (~37k lines of stemmer pattern tables) and expression (~36k) both compile clean and assemble
# clean; they are out because committing them churns ~73k lines on every codegen commit.  Their .s files are
# NOT left behind stale: a name dropped from this list must have its artifact deleted in the same commit, which
# is the whole lesson of the hello.s fossil.  Re-add a name here if the churn is ever wanted.  Largest member
# now is json at ~18k; that is the standing ceiling unless Lon rules otherwise.

# ⛔⭐⭐ RESOLVE EACH NAME TO ITS PATH -- THE FLAT `$f.sno` LOOKUP THIS REPLACED HAD BEEN SILENTLY
# REGENERATING NOTHING SINCE THE s272 CORPUS RE-GRID (hq_P, 2026-08-27).  The re-grid moved demos from
# corpus/demos/<name>.sno to corpus/demos/snobol4/<family>/<name>.sno.  This loop cd'd to corpus/demos and
# tested `[ -f "$f.sno" ]`, so after the move EVERY one of the 21 sanctioned names failed that test, took
# the `continue`, and the script then printed "No changes -- demo artifacts already current."
# ⛔ THAT IS A FALSE GREEN, NOT A GAP: the script reported SUCCESS while doing NOTHING, so the handoff rule
# "if the session touched codegen, regenerate the .s artifacts" has been a no-op for every seat since the
# re-grid, and the committed demo .s files silently froze while the compiler moved underneath them -- the
# exact hello.s fossil this script's own header was written to prevent, reintroduced by a path change.
# MEASURED at the time of the fix: a fresh --compile of calculator-1-match differs from its committed .s
# by 1,749 diff lines, none of them from tonight's cure (it is another seat's label-prefix change).
# ⭐ THE CLASS, and it is the third instance this month: A GUARD OR A LOOKUP KEYED ON A PATH IS NOT KEYED
# ON THE THING, IT IS KEYED ON A COINCIDENCE THAT A REORGANISATION CAN END -- same shape as the inert
# */programs/lon/* guards in util_oracle_flag_sweep.sh and test_gate_argnote_sweep.sh.  Resolving by SEARCH
# and REFUSING on an unresolvable member ties the script to the FILE rather than to its address.
# ⛔ AND THE SKIP IS NOW A REFUSAL, per RULES.md: a tool that cannot do its job exits non-zero rather than
# reporting success.  These 21 names are the SANCTIONED SET -- a member that does not resolve is a real
# error (a renamed or deleted demo), never something to pass over quietly.

# described the four stale Prolog demo .s as the graceful-skip declining to overwrite them.  ⛔ THAT MECHANISM WAS WRONG,
# AND THE TRUE ONE IS WORSE: the sanctioned set above is 21 SNOBOL4 names resolved as `$f.sno`, so corpus/demos/prolog/**
# was never a candidate for regeneration in the first place -- not skipped, NOT LOOKED AT.  The three chain scripts
# between them walk corpus/benchmarks/snobol4, corpus/demos (the 21 names) and corpus/benchmarks/prolog/bench; the Prolog
# DEMO tree fell in the gap between them and its artifacts had not been regenerated since they were first committed.
# ⭐ SO THIS ARM ENUMERATES BY SEARCH, NOT BY A LIST: every *.pl under $DEMO/prolog, recursively (family_net/ is nested),
# which is the same resolve-by-search discipline the SNOBOL4 arm learned from the re-grid.  A hardcoded roster is what
# put this tree in the gap; adding a second roster would only move the gap.
# ⛔ AND AN ABSENT OR EMPTY TREE IS A REFUSAL, NOT A QUIET SKIP -- that is precisely the false green this file's own
# history is a monument to: if a future re-grid moves the Prolog demos, this arm must say so loudly rather than report
# "artifacts already current" while regenerating nothing.
