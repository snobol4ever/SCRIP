# THE ROW (the remainder of ceo CEO-1533, minted 2026-10-09): an ACCESS trace handler -- TRACE(name,'ACCESS',tag,fn) -- was entered from NV_GET_fn: the variable read box
# called the C reader, which raised rt_trace_event(TRK_ACCESS) and ran the handler through APPLY_fn with the C frames live for the handler's whole life (the C2BB trace
# read descr.tiny TF rt_call_proc_descr, once per read). THE CURE, the pattern of the VALUE tap (SCRIP e18f52cbb): in a trace build the generic path of bb_var_global
# carves a trace_pend_t on the spine and calls NV_GET_open, which reads the variable exactly as NV_GET_fn does and, where a handler is due, FILLS the pend (and keeps
# the value in its cell) instead of calling it; the box enters the handler through bb_glue_trace_pend_run (rt_apply_open, the c2bb glue, rt_apply_land) as a box call,
# closes the pend (trace state restored) and reloads the value from the cell, which the collector relocates. A handler the open road declines runs in C as before.
# ARMS, each both modes, expectations cut from sbl -bf AT RUN TIME: (A) the C2BB trace of the first program holds an apply.open line (the box entered) and no C-entered
# line -- REFUSED when SCRIP_C2BB_TRACE writes nothing; (B) a tag and several reads; (C) a handler that allocates 25 KB per event under SCRIP_GC_STRESS=1 (the value
# survives the handler); (D) a handler that FRETURNs and reads the traced name itself (no nested event fires).
# NOT COVERED, NAMED: the LABEL, KEYWORD and FUNCTION kinds, and the two bb_rev_assign_global reads. The CALL and RETURN handlers of the DEFINE shim are
# test_gate_sno_a_call_and_return_trace_handler_is_entered_by_the_define_shim_box_and_its_chain_reads_clean.sh.
# FAIL-ONCE, MEASURED: on the trace-callback witness (CALL, RETURN and ACCESS handlers, X read once) the C2BB trace read 3 descr.tiny lines before this landing and 2 after (the ACCESS one
# gone, an apply.open in its place); arm A reads 0 C-entered lines and an apply.open per read on a program with an ACCESS handler alone.
# rc=0 clean · rc=1 a divergence · rc=2 REFUSAL.
