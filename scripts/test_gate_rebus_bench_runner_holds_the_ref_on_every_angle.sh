# test_gate_rebus_bench_runner_holds_the_ref_on_every_angle.sh -- THE REBUS BENCHMARK RUNNER FAILS WHAT A SINGLE-RUN TEST WOULD PASS.
#
# test_rebus_bench_suite.sh grades each benchmark under three angles in both modes (the process wrapper on the pristine kernel, then
# the program bench_wrap_rebus.py generates: fixed iterations and fixed time), the REF checked on every run and, in the generated
# angles, every repetition's VALUE held to the first and to the REF (row rebus-benchmarks-double-as-tests-..., the coo, CEO-1227).
# Lon, verbatim: "The reason to force a benchmark to also be a test is to guarantee it is not vacuous." This gate plants a fixture
# OUTSIDE the corpus tree (not a board, CEO-547: graded, nothing appended, nothing written) and requires the verdicts to be exactly:
#   good   `string_concat` copied from the corpus with its REF          -> PASS in m3 and m4
#   drift  prints 1 (its REF) on the first run, then each repetition computes another value -> the process angle PASSES and the
#          iteration and time angles FAIL naming `mismatched` -- the case a one-run test grades green
#   badref a correct kernel beside a wrong REF                           -> FAIL on all three angles, naming the value it computed
# and the board line all_pass=1 all_n=3. Needs the build (it runs scrip in both modes); ~5 s at BENCH_BUD_MS=50.
