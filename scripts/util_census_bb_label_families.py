"""util_census_bb_label_families.py -- census every label DEFINITION in one or more emitted TEXT-mode
.s files, split into greek-port-suffixed (conforming shape: name ends in alpha/beta/gamma/omega) vs
everything else, and bucket the "everything else" into FAMILIES (digits/graph-names generalized) so a
census reads as ~40 shapes instead of thousands of individual label names.

Row: bb-label-prefix-uniform (Lon's widened ruling, 2026-08-28: "ALL labels emitted in the ALPHA and
BETA block must change... EVERY variation of labels gets unified into ONE COMMON PREFIX for all in
each block"). This is step 1 (CENSUS) of that row's ## NEXT plan.

⛔ WHY THIS EXISTS RATHER THAN A ONE-LINE grep: an ASCII-only pattern (`[A-Za-z0-9_]*:`) silently drops
every Greek-suffixed label -- RULES.md INSTRUMENT LAW #15 ("an ASCII regex over UTF-8-labeled emission
is not a narrower measurement, it is a wrong one") documents this exact class already, and building
this census with grep the naive way reproduced it (seat03, 2026-08-29): a first attempt read the
massive nN_<kind>_bx family as if it were the whole non-conforming population, having silently
discarded every real n<N>_<kind>_alpha/beta label because the regex's character class stopped at the
first Greek byte. Verified against the fixed version by checking actual UTF-8 byte sequences directly
(grep -P '\\xce\\xb1' etc.) before trusting either count.
