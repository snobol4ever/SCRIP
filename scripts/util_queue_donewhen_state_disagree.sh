# util_queue_donewhen_state_disagree.sh -- row `perf-roman-8x` umbrella (hq_P 2026-08-27 rank0-picker-livelock), cure (1), minted on hq_B's measured witness 2026-08-29.
#
# ⛔⭐ THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS FOR: A ROW'S DONE-WHEN IS PROSE THE PICKER NEVER READS; ITS STATE COLUMN IS WHAT THE PICKER OBEYS; AND NOTHING CHECKS THEY AGREE.
# `icon-bench-correct-suspend-residue`'s DONE-WHEN began "after N-2 lands" while its state column read FREE.  The picker served it, correctly by its own rules, to NINE
# consecutive sessions on 2026-08-29 (11:42 12:07 12:18 12:37 14:55 15:08 15:13 15:24 15:29) -- all zero-cure, ten NEXT blocks, ten "not worked" markers.
# ⭐ AND THE LOSS ACCELERATES, WHICH IS THE PART WORTH UNDERSTANDING: a rank-0 FREE row is the top free row for a share of the fleet that GROWS as other rows get claimed,
# so the pump runs FASTEST exactly when the fleet is busiest -- the measured curve was 4-in-55min, then 5-in-34min.  Witness + arithmetic: hq_B, .github 43061128.
#
# ⛔ THIS SCRIPT ONLY REPORTS.  It never edits QUEUE.tsv and never touches a claim -- parking a row is a judgement call with an owner, and an audit that silently re-states
# the queue would be a second uncheckable authority over the same column.  Fix the row, or fix the DONE-WHEN.

  # ⛔⭐ SECOND, INDEPENDENT, STRICTLY CHEAPER DETECTOR (hq_P, found while negative-testing the first): a DONE-WHEN that is a hard-coded refusal --
  # `echo "...not mintable until X..." >&2; false` -- is UNSATISFIABLE BY CONSTRUCTION.  It needs no topic vocabulary to detect and it is a stronger
  # signal than naming a live topic: the row is not merely blocked, it has DECLARED ITSELF UNCLOSABLE and is still advertising FREE to the picker.
  # ⭐ Both rows the vocabulary check found turned out to be this shape too, which is what surfaced it.  Kept as its own class so the two are never conflated.
  # ⛔⭐ THIRD DETECTOR, AND IT IS THE ONE THAT CATCHES hq_B's ACTUAL WITNESS -- ADDED ONLY BECAUSE THE POSITIVE CONTROL FAILED.
  # The vocabulary check above misses `icon-bench-correct-suspend-residue` entirely: its DONE-WHEN opens "after N-2 lands", which is HUMAN SHORTHAND, not
  # the topic name `icon-n2-generator-activation-frames`.  ⭐ An audit built for a witness that does not fire on that witness is worse than none -- it reports
  # a clean board over the exact defect it was minted for.  Found by running the control, not by reading the code.
  # ⭐ Deliberately a NARROW prose shape, not a parser (hq_B scoped a grep): "DONE-WHEN: after|once|when ... lands|landed|is DONE|completes".
  # MEASURED before adopting: matches the witness, and hits ZERO of the 159 live FREE rows -- so it is adding signal, not noise.
