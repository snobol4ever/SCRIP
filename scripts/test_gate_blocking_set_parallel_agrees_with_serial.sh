# test_gate_blocking_set_parallel_agrees_with_serial.sh -- THE PARALLEL BLOCKING SET AGREES WITH THE SERIAL ONE
# ARM FOR ARM, AND AN ARM THAT RACED ANOTHER ARM IS rc=2 AND NEVER A RED.
# (coo 2026-09-20, row instruments-the-blocking-set-is-367-serial-arms-and-it-caps-every-seat-in-the-fleet,
# minted by the ceo on Lon's TENET condition 2.)
#
# THE MEASUREMENT THIS EXISTS FOR.  The blocking set declares 370 arms, all of them blocking, and it is
# essentially SERIAL: the cfo read 227 arms after 22 minutes at load 4.5-5.0, 850 arm-seconds inside 862
# seconds of wall at the halfway mark.  Ten seats on one 16-core box do not make a serial set faster, they
# QUEUE through it -- and on 2026-09-20 two seats independently claimed the same row inside one hour, which is
# the fleet feeling one wall from two directions.  run_blocking_set.sh --shards N already fans the set out.
# What was missing is the thing that makes a fan-out SAFE TO BELIEVE.
#
# ⛔⭐ AND THE REFUSAL MATTERS MORE THAN THE SPEED, which is the clause this gate is built around.  A parallel
# set that turns a COLLISION into a RED manufactures an UNATTRIBUTABLE FINDING: the arm does not reproduce
# serially, so a seat either chases a defect that is not there or learns to discount reds.  Under ten seats
# that is unaffordable.  So a raced arm is rc=2 COULD-NOT-MEASURE, named with the other arm and the path --
# and the two failure directions of that rule are BOTH measured here in every run, not asserted:
#   M1 UNWIRED -- the race reads as a flaky red (the state this row cures)
#   M2 GREEDY  -- convicting on time alone buries an innocent red or green under a refusal, and a set that
#                 cannot report a defect any more is worth less than the slow one it replaced.
#
# THE ARMS
#   (a) ARM FOR ARM: sequential and --shards 3 produce the IDENTICAL arm->rc map over one fixture, and the
#       same exit code.  Name sets agree AND every arm's own verdict agrees -- two readings can agree on a
#       count and disagree on membership (CEO-825 clause 1), and on membership while disagreeing per arm.
#   (b) A RACE IS REFUSED AND NAMES BOTH ARMS: two arms that rendezvous and move the same watched path are
#       BOTH rc=2, both named with the path, and the run exits 2 (UNPROVEN) rather than 1 (RED).
#   (c) A GENUINE RED SURVIVES A RACE: an independent red arm in the same run is still RED and still decides
#       the exit code.  A detector that buries reds is the worse defect.
#   (d) NO FALSE COLLISION: two concurrent arms that touch NOTHING on the watched surface stay GREEN, exit 0.
#   (e) THE MUTANTS, RUN AND MEASURED HERE: M1 reds the race; M2 refuses the innocent pair.
#   (f) THE REAL DECLARATION PARTITIONS: every declared arm is in exactly one shard or is declared serial --
#       which is what carries (a)'s fixture result onto the 370 arms nobody can run twice inside a gate.
#   (g) BOTH SHAPES STAMP wall, load, tree and detector state, spelled identically, so "both arms of the same
#       tree" is checkable by a reader instead of remembered by a runner.
#   (h) AN UNREADABLE SURFACE DECLARATION REFUSES rc=2, and a MISSING one turns the detector off and SAYS SO.
#       "I could not read the hazard list" and "the hazard list is empty" are facts a driver must never conflate.
#
# FAIL_ONCE=1 runs the primary arms against M1 (detector unwired) -- (b) and (c) must fail.
# FAIL_ONCE=2 runs them against M2 (greedy) -- (d) must fail.
# A mutant that does not mutate proves nothing, so a sed that matches no anchor REFUSES rc=2.
