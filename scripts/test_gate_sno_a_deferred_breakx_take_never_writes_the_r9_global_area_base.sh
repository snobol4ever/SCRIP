# test_gate_sno_a_deferred_breakx_take_never_writes_the_r9_global_area_base.sh -- a deferred BREAKX whose argument calls an
# undefined function fails its statement and the program runs on, as sbl -bf does, in both modes. Row
# snobol4-a-deferred-breakx-whose-argument-calls-an-undefined-function-crashes-both-modes (cto 2026-10-09). THE BRACKET: the fault was
# the NEXT statement's assignment V = 'b', n25_assign_bx's mov qword ptr [r9], rax with r9 = 0 (both modes, SIGSEGV at a null
# address). r9 is the pinned base of the global-variable area (RTCC_GLOBAL_R9_GVA; the veneer re-establishes it after a call), and
# bb_match_breakx.cpp's deferred arms loaded the take's length into r9d as scratch before copying it to edx; on the take's error
# road (js to omega, F undefined) no later call ran, so r9 left the statement holding a length. The cure loads the take's pointer
# and length straight into rsi and edx, and the template never writes r9.
# ARMS: (1) the witness in mode 3 prints sbl's lines, rc 0; (2) the same in mode 4; (3) mode 3 under SCRIP_GC_STRESS=1 the same;
# (4) STATIC: bb_match_breakx.cpp never writes r9 (a mov, lea, pop or xor naming r9 or r9d as its destination; r8 is ordinary scratch).
# FAIL_ONCE=1 greps the static arm for rsi instead of r9, which the template does write, so arm 4 must red.
