# test_gate_gc_dt_data_names_one_pointed_at_shape.sh -- F6 STEP 5, THE HEAP HALF (cfo; ceo CEO-887/888).
#
# ⛔ THE DEFECT.  DT_DATA carried TWO unrelated pointed-at shapes under ONE tag: the .u arm is a DATINST_t (a
# record instance) and the .ptr arm is a raw DESCR_t element vector (an Icon list's frame_elems backing store).
# Both were minted with slen 0, so NOTHING IN THE DESCRIPTOR SAID WHICH.  Every reader guessed from context and
# the COLLECTOR guessed by strcmp-ing an owner's field name -- gc_visit_datinst asked whether the record's
# first field was called "frame_elems".  A reader that guessed wrong read a DATBLK_t* out of the first element
# of a descriptor array: a SILENT WRONG ANSWER, not a crash, which is the worst failure shape we have.
#
# ⭐ THE CURE IS DT_N's OWN SCHEME, ALREADY IN THIS HEADER (DT_N slen 0 char*, 1 DESCR_t*, 2 VCELL_t*; DT_E's
# PROCVAL_*_SLEN; DT_S's 0xFFFFFFFF CSET): slen arbitrates DT_DATA too -- DATA_INST_SLEN 0, DATA_ELEMS_SLEN 1,
# pinned by a _Static_assert beside PROCVAL's so a future third meaning cannot quietly reuse one.
#
# ⛔ THE ceo's TWO CONDITIONS ARE ARMS 1 AND 3 HERE, AND CONDITION (2) IS THE WHOLE JOB: "the readers are the
# whole job, not the writers -- a reader that checks only the tag after this lands is a silent wrong answer
# rather than a crash".  Arm 1 is that population and it must read ZERO.
#
# ⛛⭐ ARM 5 IS THE ONLY ARM THAT CAN SEE A COLLECTOR DEFECT, written the way the coo's decidable test taught:
# a green suite is evidence about the collector ONLY if something FORCES it to run, FORCES the heap to slide
# under a live value, and then READS THAT VALUE BACK.  It WALKS the band rather than sampling it, because the
# failure band is ragged -- the cfo's cset defect was RED at 1,2,3,4,5,8,10 and GREEN at 0,15,20,30,50,100, so
# a two-point DONE-WHEN at 30 and 200 reads clean and banks the defect (CEO-807/876).
#
# ⛛ WHAT THIS ROW DID NOT LAND, AND WHY THE REMAINDER IS PRINTED RATHER THAN GRADED TO ZERO.  The natural next
# move is retyping the list element vectors from rt_ws_alloc (HB_WS) to rt_ws_alloc_descr (HB_DVEC), so the
# element COUNT comes from the block header instead of the owner's frame_size and the conservative interior
# scan can stop walking them.  THAT IS HELD ON A MEASURED REGRESSION, BISECTED TO ONE SITE: with only
# by_name_dispatch.c's put-growth vector retyped, the vendored Arizona gc2 witness goes from 0 of 5 red to 5 of
# 5 red in BOTH modes -- SIGSEGV in FIELD_GET_fn with the record's type block reading 0xDB poison.  The cause is
# NOT lost conservative coverage: an 8-byte-stride audit of every retyped block found ZERO heap-pointing words
# outside a 16-byte-aligned DESCR payload whose tag declares it.  So the remainder is a MEASURED OPEN QUESTION
# with a named starting point, not an estimate.
#
# ⛛ ONE RUN IS NOT A MEASUREMENT AND IT ALMOST GOT BANKED AS ONE: restoring the conservative scan on top of the
# precise walk made gc2 pass ONCE, which looked like the explanation; repeated five times it passed ZERO times.
# This defect is intermittent, which is why a COUNT is the verdict and a single green is discarded.
#
# ⛛ IT REFUSES rc=2 RATHER THAN PASSING when no collection ran, nothing moved, or the element arm was never
# reached: a band green because the collector never ran is the 320-entry reading, not evidence, and no later
# landing may green this gate by making the collector quiet or by taking the witness off the path it grades.
