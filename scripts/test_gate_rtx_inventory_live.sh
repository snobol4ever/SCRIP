#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (RTX-2/RTX-3, s163): section 5's family table is hand-written and ROTS.
# RTX-2 was aimed at blk_alloc/blk_free, which have no definition in src/ and no live call
# site; the STR row then turned out to name rt_concat/rt_lcomp/rt_acomp, which do not exist
# either. A rung pointed at a ghost burns a session before anyone notices, so the check that
# would have caught it in two minutes is now mechanical and repeatable.
#
# For every symbol: does src/ define it, and does the LIVE compiler emit calls to it?
#   DEF+CALLED  defined in the runtime AND called by live blobs
#   DEF-ONLY    defined, reached only from inside the runtime (NOT a defect -- see below)
#   PHANTOM     absent from the linked runtime -> never put a rung on this
# DEF-ONLY is NOT a defect: rt_gcheap_alloc is DEF-ONLY and underlies every mint. A static
# blob->runtime count ranks the CALL BOUNDARY, not the hot path (RTX-2 finding, consequence a).
#
# ⚠ ADVISORY, NOT A HARD GATE (downgraded s163, the same session it was written). This script
# gave TWO false verdicts before it gave a true one: a src/ regex called rt_proc_call_epilogue_
# (178 call sites) a phantom, and after switching the oracle to nm the name STILL missed because
# the inventory was truncating Greek port suffixes. It now agrees with the linker on everything
# checked, but it has been wrong twice and its symbol list is hand-maintained, so it REPORTS and
# never blocks. Treat a PHANTOM row as "go verify this", not as proof. Exit is always 0.
