# test_gate_sno_a_fence_before_a_run_or_inside_an_arbno_body_retries_what_follows_it.sh -- FENCE(P) COMMITS P, NOT WHAT
# FOLLOWS IT: after a one-argument FENCE succeeds, an alternation, an ARBNO or an ARB to its RIGHT is still retried when a
# later element fails, exactly as SPITBOL does (hq_snocone 2026-09-27, found under the Snocone and Pascal self-hosted parsers;
# Lon 2026-09-27: "Get the parser_*.sc programs to 100%.").
#
# MECHANISM, measured by ASM-DIFF between a passing and a failing sibling in one mode: src/lower/lower_snobol4.c's TT_SEQ
# lowering builds a fenced sequence RIGHT TO LEFT and, after building FENCE1, re-routes the right-hand run's failure exit into
# the FENCE's beta through right_tail. For a MULTI-element run right_tail held the run's LAST element (its resume node), so the
# last element's omega jumped straight to match_fence1_beta and every alternative between the FENCE and it was skipped:
#     'xabc' ? FENCE('x') ('a' | 'ab') 'c'          SPITBOL succeeds, SCRIP failed in m3 and m4.
# And TT_ARBNO takes its body range (operands 1 and 2, which the emitter scans for the body's tail beta) as the first and the
# last node BUILT, which for a right-to-left fenced body is the wrong end, so resuming an iteration fell to the body's FIRST
# element instead of the inner ARBNO that could grow:
#     '{c:bb}' ? POS(0) '{' ARBNO('c' FENCE('') ':' ARBNO('b')) '}' RPOS(0)       SPITBOL succeeds, SCRIP failed.
# CURE: right_tail is the run's FIRST element for a multi-element run; the fenced TT_SEQ publishes the last node built for its
# rightmost segment with the entry it returns, and ARBNO uses it (entry and that node) when the entry is its own body's.
# AND THE SAME CURE CLOSES hq_snocone's 2026-09-16 row runtime-built-fence-with-an-argument-under-a-nested-arbno-fails-a-match-spitbol-makes
# (witness 11, the finding at .github 9ac79865b): F = FENCE('0'), T = F ARBNO('*' F), X = T ARBNO('+' T) built through INDIRECT
# assignment targets, '0*0' ? POS(0) X RPOS(0) -- SPITBOL matches; SCRIP failed in m3 and m4 on the unpatched tree (A/B on one base).
# STILL OPEN, not armed here (with the cto): ARBNO(P) with the fenced sequence held in a VARIABLE (a PAT$ graph whose fenced
# body root meets the zeta seam-tier check): P1 = 'c' FENCE('+' | '') ':' ARBNO('b'); '{c:bb}' ? POS(0) '{' ARBNO(P1) '}' RPOS(0).
#
# AND WITNESS 12 (hq_snobol4's bisect of rungs entry arbno_fence_span_branch_7 to cc0e5a2a6): ARBNO(FENCE('+') SPAN(d) . L1),
# a fenced body whose rightmost segment ends in a conditional capture -- the ARBNO's range operands must span the WHOLE body in
# the emitter's order (a gamma-first DFS from the body entry), and its resume operand is the body's rightmost tail, or the capture
# record is read as outside the ARBNO (rt_dcap_pump: CORRUPT CAPTURE ENTRY) and the match fails.
# ARMS: (1) mode 3 and (2) mode 4 run one witness program of twelve statements, each printing a YES or NO line; the ref is CUT FROM
# THE ORACLE at run time and every line must match byte for byte. Two control lines (no FENCE; nested ARBNO without a FENCE)
# were green before the cure and must stay green.
