# test_gate_icon_shipped_trees_compile_under_icont.sh -- THE SHIPPED-TREE GRADABILITY GATE (CEO-489, hq_V
# 2026-09-10). The widening the ceo granted of test_gate_icon_master_entries_compile_under_icont.sh, whose
# criterion this file carries onto EVERY SHIPPED .icn rather than only the ones the Icon master stores.
#
# THE CRITERION, in the ceo's words (CEO-489): every shipped `.icn` under corpus packages/icon, tests/icon,
# benchmarks/icon and demos/icon compiles under `icont -s -c`; the SEMICOLON CLASS is reported SEPARATELY from
# the jcon preprocessor and declaration forms, and THE TWO ARE NEVER SUMMED. hq_B's CEO-488 repair row
# (`icon-every-shipped-icn-file-our-conversion-added-semicolons-that-icont-refuses-are-removed-so-icont-
# compiles-it`) closes on THIS gate reading ZERO semicolon-class refusals.
#
# ⛔⭐ WHY THE CLASS SPLIT IS THE WHOLE INSTRUMENT, AND WHY A SINGLE "41 REFUSED" IS WORSE THAN NO NUMBER.
# The two classes have two different owners and two different truths. The semicolon class is OURS: our
# conversion added a statement terminator that Arizona icont refuses, so every carrying file is a file we
# broke and hq_B can repair. The other class is NOT ours and is NOT repairable by deleting anything: it is
# jcon preprocessor and declaration forms (`$undef` arity, `import`, `$ifdef` arity, `=` at declaration
# position, an `inconsistent redeclaration`) that the vendored jcon dialect accepts and Arizona icont never
# did. Summing them produces a number that falls as hq_B works and STILL never reaches zero, so the row's
# DONE-WHEN could never fire and a reader would route vendored-dialect files to hq_B's lane forever.
#
# ⛔⛔ THE CLASSIFIER IS MEASURED, NOT ASSERTED, AND THAT IS NOT GOLD-PLATING -- A MESSAGE-SHAPE CLASSIFIER IS
# MEASURABLY WRONG ON THIS POPULATION. The obvious rule is "the token icont quotes is a `;`". It misfiles
# packages/icon/jcon_tests/prepro.icn, which is a DELIBERATE preprocessor-error fixture: it raises
# `$undef: too many arguments` AND five `";": missing right parenthesis` in one compile, so a token-shape rule
# hands hq_B a vendored fixture whose semicolons cannot be removed and whose refusal cannot be cured. It also
# cannot see the `"}": invalid case clause` shape at all, where the offending `;` sits on the PREVIOUS line and
# the token icont names is the brace. So a file is called SEMICOLON-CLASS here only when this gate has
# DEMONSTRATED, by re-running the oracle, that deleting `;` BYTES AND NOTHING ELSE makes icont accept it --
# which is precisely the property hq_B's DONE-WHEN asserts per file (bytes removed == semicolons removed).
# Every deletion is at a position ICONT ITSELF FLAGGED; this gate never scans for semicolons it likes the look
# of, and it never writes a repair back to the tree -- it measures in a private temp dir and reports.
#
# ⛔ THREE OUTCOMES, NEVER SUMMED -- the CEO-483 lesson applied a second time. semicolon-class refusals,
# other-form refusals, and UNDECIDED (the probe was still deleting semicolons when the iteration cap hit) are
# three diagnoses with three owners. UNDECIDED is rc=2 COULD-NOT-MEASURE and never rc=1, because a probe that
# ran out of budget has proven nothing about the file and must not be delivered to hq_B as work.
#
# ⛔ STAGING IS BY SYMLINK INTO A TEMP TREE, ONE DIRECTORY AT A TIME, AND THE REASON IS CORRECTNESS BEFORE
# SPEED. `icont -s -c` writes `.u1`/`.u2` beside the source, so compiling 1379 files IN PLACE would drop ~2700
# artifacts into the corpus working tree -- and a dirty tree is refused by every runner we own (CEO-174), so
# the gate would break the next seat's measurement rather than its own. Symlinking the whole directory (not
# the one file) is what makes `$include` resolve exactly as it does in the tree: the CEO-483 retraction turned
# on a companion that was present and declared the whole time and that the instrument simply was not staging,
# and the ceo's own slower census carries that same defect -- it reports `"prepro.dat": cannot open` as a
# refusal where this gate compiles the file. Artifacts land as REAL files in temp; the corpus stays clean,
# asserted below rather than assumed.
#
# ⛔ THIS GATE GRADES SHIPPED TEXT, NOT SCRIP. It never runs ./scrip and no compiler change can move it.
# A red here means we ship Icon source Arizona icont refuses.
#
# ⛔ NOT WIRED INTO `make test` WHILE IT IS RED. It reads FAIL(1) with 18 semicolon-class files named until
# hq_B's CEO-488 row lands, and wiring a known-red arm blocking would turn `make test` red for all thirteen
# seats and make every other seat pay for one open row (CEO-463). IT WIRES BLOCKING THE MOMENT IT READS ZERO,
# and it must -- the conversion is a WRITER, and a writer that regresses re-manufactures the class silently,
# which is the identical argument that keeps the master gate wired.
