# test_gate_gc_the_asm_allocator_carves_reused_ground_after_a_collection.sh -- THE ARMED ASM CARVE (rtx_alloc.s) USED TO REFUSE ANY
# BLOCK BELOW THE VIRGIN MARK, so after the first collection EVERY allocation of the process fell to c_rt_gcheap_alloc: table_access
# at the shipped 128 KB arena made 398,079 allocations and the C entry answered 398,079 of them, ~250 Ir each against ~35 in the
# armed path (ceo 2026-09-25, CEO-1256; callgrind of the 60-iteration twin). Since this landing the armed path carves reused ground
# too: it zeroes the payload in line (the tail 32 bytes of a string, the whole payload otherwise, exactly as rt_gcheap_carve does),
# keeps the virgin mark the maximum it ever was, and stops at g_hp_fr.line, which is now the LOWER of the pacing line and the
# quarantine's low bound (gc_fr_line_sync), so it can never carve into PROT_NONE ground; C is reached only at a line or quarantine
# boundary. THE MEASUREMENT: gdb counts the C entry's hits over a churning witness at 128 KB (a breakpoint with an ignore count)
# beside the collection count; the bound is a few C entries per collection, where the old behaviour is one per allocation.
# ARMS: (1) the witness prints the oracle's answer under the shipped arena; (2) collections >= 50 (else the population is a
# refusal); (3) C entry hits <= 8 * collections + 64. FAIL_ONCE (recorded): the pre-cure runtime at 0f560a28e read 398,079 hits
# over 2,482 collections; this tree reads 4,965 (two per collection: the pacing line and the quarantine boundary).
# EXIT 0 all arms; 1 a red (named); 2 REFUSED (gdb, sbl or the build missing, or too few collections to grade).
