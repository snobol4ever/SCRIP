# test_gate_pas_a_boolean_tag_field_prints_as_a_boolean_and_new_assigns_a_pointer_field_of_a_variant_arm.sh -- write of a Boolean tag-field prints true or false, and new(r.p) stores the new pointer in a field of a variant arm of a record variable (ISO 7185 6.9.3.3, 6.6.5.3).
#
# MEASURED 2026-10-09 by hq_pascal against fpc -Miso: `type valu = record case intval: boolean of true: (ival: integer); false: (valp: ^integer) end; ... v.intval := false; writeln(v.intval)` printed 0 where fpc prints false, in both modes (the tag field was registered with no Boolean class: the type of a tag is not
# parsed through the field rule that sets it); and `x.t := true; new(x.b); x.b^ := 2` for a record VARIABLE x with a pointer field b in a variant arm died with "the pointer-variable of an identified-variable is undefined", because the argument of new arrives wrapped in the variant read-check and new assigned into the wrapper, not the field
# (the same through a pointer, y^.b, worked). Found running Pascal-P5's compiler, whose valu and attr records are exactly these.
# CURE (pascal.y only; no new global): the tag field of a variant part is registered with the Boolean class of its type (the pending flag is set from the tag's type for that one pas_pend_add and restored); the new() call unwraps the variant read-check from its argument, assigns the allocation to the bare field and keeps the check (the tag must select that arm).
#
# ARMS, both modes: two controls cut LIVE from fpc -Miso that must be byte-identical: a Boolean tag printed after each assignment in a bare variant record and in a record with a leading field; new() of a plain pointer field, of a pointer field in a variant arm of a record variable and of the same through a pointer, then reads through them, and the tag printed. FAIL_ONCE=1 corrupts the first control's ref.
