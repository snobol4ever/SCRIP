# POPULATION: every git-tracked file in the sibling repos SCRIP, corpus and .github, corpus/packages/ INCLUDED since Lon's
# word of 2026-10-02 (in-chat to the ceo, verbatim: "Get rid of all DOS line-endings; just say no to CR-LF."; ceo CEO-1414: 59
# vendored files converted in one corpus commit, two Gimpel oracle rejections cured by it), MINUS generated flex/bison outputs
# and MINUS the files lf_gate_crlf_is_the_subject.tsv declares -- files whose carriage returns ARE what a test measures, each
# with its reason; a declared file that is gone or holds no CR reds as STALE. (Until 2026-10-02 corpus/packages/ was excluded
# whole, on FINDING-2026-08-20-s183's measurement that curing gimpel's CRLF lowered its score then.)
# WHAT IT COUNTS: a CR at END OF LINE (\r$). A CR byte inside a string literal (benchmarks/icon/geddump.s carries
# "\t\n\r " as DATA in a .string directive) is not a line ending and is not counted.
# WHY IT EXISTS: Python's csv.writer defaults lineterminator to "\r\n", so util_build_rungs_suite.py re-minted every
# ALL.csv as CRLF on each rebuild; tests/prolog/ALL.csv was converted by hand (corpus 1feca4aa4) and the other five were
# not, and a seat then RESTORED snobol4's CRLF (corpus 40441ed53) applying the binary-read rule with no law to read
# against -- RULES.md carried no LF rule until 2026-09-04. A rule with no instrument is a memo; this is the instrument.
# rc=0 clean (population printed) / rc=1 red (every offender named) / rc=2 cannot measure (never a silent zero).
# FAIL-ONCE PROOF: LF_GATE_REPOS="<dir> ..." overrides the repo list; point it at a scratch git repo holding one
# CRLF file and the gate must print RED rc=1, then LF the file and it must print PASS rc=0.
