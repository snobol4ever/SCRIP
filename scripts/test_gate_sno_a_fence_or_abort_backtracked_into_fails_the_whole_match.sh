# test_gate_sno_a_fence_or_abort_backtracked_into_fails_the_whole_match.sh -- backtracking into a bare FENCE, or reaching ABORT, fails
# the WHOLE pattern match -- no other alternative and no later start position is tried -- when the FENCE ends an alternation arm, and
# when the FENCE or ABORT sits in a pattern held in a variable (inlined, deferred *P, or a recursive thunk), in both modes, as SPITBOL
# answers it.
#
# ⛔ THE DEFECTS (two, one class; Flake kalah-opening-search error 239 and fullscan-palindrome, graded reds, both modes).
#   (A) INLINE: TT_SEQ lowered the FIRST bare FENCE of a sequence with its omega on the sequence's LOCAL failure (the first_f0 rule),
#       so a FENCE ending an alternation arm backtracked into the next arm: 'XAYAC' ('A' FENCE | 'Q') 'C' -> sbl fails, SCRIP matched
#       at cursor 3. A stored R = 'A' FENCE inlined as R 'C' or *R 'C' is the same shape.
#   (B) THUNK: a pattern that is not inlined (ABORT inside it, or recursion such as kalah's INITBRD_PAT = FENCE ... *INITBRD_PAT) is a
#       thunk whose seal was its OWN failure exit, so ABORT or a sealed FENCE failed only the thunk and the unanchored scan moved on:
#       P = ('B' | ABORT) / 'SNOBOL' P -> sbl fails, SCRIP matched; kalah called *INITBRD1(P) at a later cursor with P = '' and died
#       on $'' (error 239).
# THE CURE (SNOBOL4's own nodes): (A) a bare FENCE's own omega is the enclosing pat_seal; (B) every pattern-thunk builder seals to a
# SNOBOL4-only IR_MATCH_ABORT marker (literal payload 1) that sets r14d = -2 -- an impossible cursor -- and leaves by the thunk's
# failure; each IR_MATCH_DEFER carries its enclosing seal as an operand, resolved into the t1 target port, and at its omega return
# tests r14d == -2 and jumps there, so an abort chains outward through nested thunks to the statement.
# MONITOR BRACKET (kalah, 2026-09-25): step 527 stno 219 -- spl LABEL 209 after RETURN INITBRD1, scr resumes the scan and assigns P.
#
# THE ARMS (expectations cut from sbl -bf AT RUN TIME):
#   1-2  m3 / m4: the diverging shapes -- a FENCE ending an arm (inline, stored, deferred), a stored and a nested-thunk ABORT, a
#        recursive FENCE-led stored pattern calling a function at match time                                        -- RED on base
#   3    m3: Flake kalah-opening-search with its @input block                                                        -- RED on base
#   4    m3: Flake fullscan-palindrome with its @input block                                                         -- RED on base
#   5-6  CONTROL m3 / m4: shapes base already answers -- FENCE inside one sequence, FENCE(P), ARBNO with FENCE or ABORT, a
#        leading FENCE, a plain stored pattern that still retries at the next cursor
# EXIT: 0 all arms pass · 1 an arm failed · 2 REFUSED (no binary, no oracle, no Flake package, the oracle's answer moved).
