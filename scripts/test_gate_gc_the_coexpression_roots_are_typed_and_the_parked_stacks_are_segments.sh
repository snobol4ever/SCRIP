# GUESSES NOTHING, CEO-812; Lon 2026-09-19 in-chat: "r13 for SNOBOL4 and Icon points to the subject string, &subject").
#
# WHAT WAS THERE. gc_coexpr_roots swept SEVEN regions word by word with gc_zeta_frame: the parked main thread's whole
# [stack] mapping, the root context's gc_spill[6] and xmit[2], every linked context's gc_spill[6], xmit[2] and
# entry_arg+8..56, and every parked co-expression's whole 8 MB thread stack (which rt_coexpr.c ALSO registered as a
# GC root range, so it was swept twice). MEASURED FROM THE CODE, NOT FROM THE BATON'S READING: gc_spill was not a
# DESCR array -- scrip_coswitch's inline asm stored rbx, rbp, r12, r13, r14, r15, the raw callee-saved register file
# at the switch -- and NOTHING ever reloaded a register from it, so the collector's rewrite of those six words never
# reached a register: a conservative visit that could keep a dead block alive and could not keep a live pointer
# right. xmit IS one DESCR (bb_activate stages rsi:rdx, bb_coret rdi:rsi, the runtime writes exactly those words).
# entry_arg is TWO records: the Icon create package (r12,r13,r14,r15,rbx,csav5 at +8..+56) and rt.c's generator-
# thread record rt_genp_s (rbx,r12,r13,r14,r15 at +8..+48, co.thread at +48).
#
# WHAT IS HERE. (1) xmit is a DESCR_t field visited by rt_gc_visit_descr -- typed by its own tag. (2) gc_spill is
# DELETED; scrip_coswitch records park_sp (the parked thread's rsp) instead. (3) the generator record is tagged
# sigma_live at creation (scan_depth > 0: the creator was inside a string scan, so the marshalled r13 IS a heap
# subject pointer) and only then is its r13 word visited raw -- the generator record's word at +24 (pinned by rt.c's own _Static_assert offsetof(regs)==8 and its `movq 24(%rdi), %r13`; arm 7
# reads both lines because rt.c is another seat's file). (4) the parked stacks are SEGMENTS of the same population
# as the running stack: one iterator hands every segment (parked main, each parked co-expression, then the running
# thread from the poll's floor) to the ONE remaining stack-walker call, reported under pop=parked; the walker row
# replaces that call by the mapped walk. gc_zeta_frame_calls 11 -> 4 (the registered ranges, the segments, the
# pz seam, the heap interior); the rt_coexpr.c stack root range is gone. (5) THE SWITCH RELOADS THE GLOBAL
# (bb_activate, bb_coret; row icon-a-co-expression-that-changes-the-subject-its-activator-scans-..., hq_icon
# 2026-10-08 on the cfo's 2026-09-27 ruling): iconx keeps &subject and &pos global across a co-expression switch, so
# after every switch r13/r15 are reloaded from the rooted global scan_subj and its length cache (rt_scan_live_regs,
# visited raw by gen_gc_roots) and r14 from scan_pos. The 2026-09-19 SWITCH RECORD -- r13 spilled as one tagged DESCR
# cell across the switch and restored after it -- is DELETED: it kept the subject right under motion but restored
# the activator's OWN subject, so an activator never saw a subject its co-expression assigned (w1: iconx zz 1, the
# record abc 1). The Icon create package's seeded r13/r15 and their sigma_live visit are DELETED with it: the
# trampoline loads both from the global at the body's first entry.
#
# THE ACCIDENT THIS GATE NAMES (measured with gdb and objdump on 2026-09-19): the subject block of hb_coexpr_sigma
# moved 0x7ffe6d61b200 -> 0x7ffe6d61b1b0 under SCRIP_GC_STRESS=8 and r13 FOLLOWED it, although no frame of ours saves
# r13 on the switch path (scrip_coswitch, scrip_coexpr_activate, scrip_coret push rbp only). glibc's sem_wait slow
# path (libc.so.6 +0xa5000) pushes rbp, r13, r12, rbx: the parked thread's r13 lived in a libc stack word, the
# whole-stack sweep rewrote it, and `pop %r13` on wake restored the relocated pointer. So the register survived a
# collection across a co-expression switch ONLY through glibc's register allocation plus a sweep of libc's frames.
# The switch record replaces the accident with the design (section 6.5: registers are made visible as tagged cells).
#
# THE INSTRUMENT THAT MAKES THE FAIL-ONCES DETERMINISTIC: SCRIP_GC_PLANT_SHIFT=N forwards EVERY live block N bytes up
# at EVERY collection over a kept fill at the arena start (two-pass slide: down-movers ascending, up-movers
# descending), so a stale copy of any heap address is wrong after every collection. Without it a conservative
# regime keeps dead blocks alive through stale frame slots and the subject rarely slides (six witness shapes, one
# 80-byte slide in one cadence). Every arm below runs under it. It is a plant, default off, no effect when unset.
#
# ARMS. (1) census + structure: gc_zeta_frame_calls <= 4, gc_spill absent, no stack root range in rt_coexpr.c.
# (2) the three witnesses match their iconx-cut refs at SCRIP_GC_STRESS=1,3,5,8 under the shift plant in BOTH modes
# (band printed). (3) EMISSION: every `call scrip_coexpr_activate` and `call scrip_coret` in the sigma witness's
# mode-4 asm is followed by the global reload (call rt_scan_live_regs, then mov r13, rax and mov r15, rdx) and
# carries no r13 spill before it. (4) THE GLOBAL'S VISIT IS LOAD-BEARING: with the parked sweep bounded at park_sp
# (SCRIP_GC_COEXPR_PLANT=2 -- glibc's words excluded, the accident switched off) the sigma witness matches its ref,
# and with gen_gc_roots' scan_subj visit dropped (SCRIP_GC_COEXPR_PLANT=3) it does not, both modes. (5) THE PACKAGE
# HOLDS NO SUBJECT WORD: scrip_coexpr_entry_pkg_t has no r13/r15 field and no visitor reads one; hb_coexpr_create
# (a co-expression created inside a scan, first activated after collections) matches its ref at every stress and
# loses it at some stress per mode under SCRIP_GC_COEXPR_PLANT=3, so its inherited subject rides on the global.
# (6) the reporter prints [GC-COEXPR] with sigma=0 on both witnesses (no Icon package holds a subject word; only the
# generator record can) and reports the parked population. (7) the cross-file pin for the generator record's r13 word.
#
# MEASURED AND RECORDED, NOT HIDDEN. (a) The parked segments are still swept over their WHOLE mappings (8 MB each;
# the reporter read 617 MB over 98 ranges on the sigma witness) because every runtime call that can park a thread
# (the by-name generator call, rt_call_value_gen_h -> rt_proc_call_gen_h) still relies on glibc's words for its
# caller's r13; the bound at park_sp is the polls row's step once every parking site carries a record -- Lon
# 2026-09-19: do not let optimization stand in the way of a working GC. (b) Arizona transmit.icn and coexpr.icn lose
# their &errout trace output under SCRIP_GC_STRESS=5 on origin acbb36b00 (12 -> 2 and 18 -> 0 lines, rc 0), the
# same on a clean base build and on this tree -- pre-existing, handed to the ceo's Icon seat.
