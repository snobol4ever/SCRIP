# test_gate_port_exit_value_contract.sh — THE PORT-EXIT VALUE CONTRACT gate.
# Row: port-exit-value-contract-untagged-rax-forges-dt-fail (hq_P-owned; class triaged by hq_C from
# seat09's Pascal root-cause).  Built by seat02 2026-09-01 as that row's CENSUS+GATE rung.
#
# THE CONTRACT: a procedure-level success exit (`<proc>_γ:` opening `mov rdi, rax` / `mov rsi, rdx`)
# forwards rax:rdx as the procedure's DESCR_t return value, and the caller detects a failed nested
# call with `cmp al, 104` (DT_FAIL = 0x68; DESCR_t.v is uint8_t, so the tag IS rax's low byte).
# EVERY transfer reaching such an exit must therefore arrive with a real DESCR_t in rax:rdx.
# A transfer arriving with an untagged value forges DT_FAIL whenever that value's low byte is 104 —
# a silent, data-dependent (or, for a `lea`'d code address, LINK-LAYOUT-dependent) wrong answer that
# cascades a spurious ω one frame at a time up the entire live call chain.
#
# ⭐ IT IS A GENERATION-TIME CHECK, DELIBERATELY, per the row's DONE-WHEN: the defect is
# data-dependent, so a runtime assert fires only on the inputs that already broke.  This reads the
# emitted mode-4 TEXT and answers the question for every path, including unexercised ones.
# ⛔ MODE-SCOPED (MODES MAY DIVERGE, Lon 2026-08-28): this reads mode-4 TEXT and binds mode 4 only.

# ⭐⭐ TWO INDEPENDENT INSTRUMENTS MUST AGREE, AND BOTH ARE PRINTED FROM THIS ONE COMMAND (RULES.md
# INSTRUMENT LAWS thirteenth batch: an invariant that lives in the gap between two sites is held by
# neither; a probe that prints both sides turns a future divergence into a run instead of a re-derivation).
#   SIDE A -- the EMITTER's own view: x86_port_hook fires [PORT-EXIT-PROMOTION] under SCRIP_PORT_EXIT_AUDIT=1
#             at the one chokepoint every port transfer passes, when the target IS the chain's own γ label.
#   SIDE B -- the post-hoc TEXT scan above, which finds procedure exits by their `mov rdi, rax` promotion.
# They are derived from completely different evidence, so agreement is real cross-validation and a
# DISAGREEMENT IS ITSELF A FINDING -- it means one of the two has drifted from what the compiler does.
# ⛔⭐ IT IS A SUBSET CHECK, NOT AN EQUALITY, AND THAT ASYMMETRY IS MEASURED RATHER THAN ASSUMED.
# The emitter side is KNOWN INCOMPLETE: `g_emit.flat_lcl_proc` is true for most callable chains but not
# all. Measured 2026-09-01 over this witness set -- emitter 31 vs TEXT 36, the whole gap inside fbench.pas
# (`transitxsurface_γ` 4 + `initialise_γ` 1), two procedures whose γ exits DO marshal rax:rdx but whose
# chains do not carry that flag. Gating on EQUALITY against a known-incomplete instrument would print
# UNPROVEN forever, which is a refusal that has stopped meaning anything.
# ⭐ SO THE DIRECTION IS WHAT MATTERS: the emitter seeing a promotion-site transfer the TEXT scan MISSED is
# a real divergence and refuses (the TEXT scan would have a blind spot in the dangerous direction).
# The reverse is the characterized shortfall above and is reported as coverage, not as a verdict.
