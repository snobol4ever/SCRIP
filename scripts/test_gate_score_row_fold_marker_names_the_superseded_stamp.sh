# test_gate_score_row_fold_marker_names_the_superseded_stamp.sh -- A FOLDED TAIL NAMES ITS OWN DATE AND TREE, MACHINE-INSERTED
# (coo 2026-09-16; hq_prolog's third observation the same day, row util-score-row-board-write-folds-the-replaced-cells-tail-forward-
# as-provenance-without-a-machine-marker).
#
# THE DEFECT: util_score_row.py write folds the tail of the cell it replaces forward as provenance (CEO-475's one-archived-reading
# bound) under a fixed marker that says the tail is not asserted -- but not WHEN it was true or on WHICH tree.  hq_prolog's fresh
# master 542/563 shipped glued to prose reading '334 is DOWN from 340' from 2026-09-05, which a reader meets as current, and they
# hand-labelled the retained tail 'RETAINED PROVENANCE FROM THE SUPERSEDED 2026-09-05 READING (b812fb6d1)'.  A seat remembering to
# write that label is the failure mode.
#
# THE CURE UNDER TEST: supersede_marker() reads the replaced reading's own `<key>:` provenance clause and puts its hash, date and
# measurer into the marker, beside the fold's own date and writer -- so the tail reads 'superseded <today> by <seat>; the reading
# below was stamped <key>: SCRIP <hash> on <date> by <seat>' without anyone writing it.
#
# ARMS (the writer's own selftest, which plants a rebus floor cell, writes a lossy replacement over it and reads the fold back):
#   (a) the selftest proves the marker names the superseded reading's stamp and the fold's date
#   (b) the writer defines supersede_marker and the fold site calls it (the fixed SUPERSEDE_MARKER alone is the defect)
#   (c) the selftest wrote nothing to the real .github/SCORE.md
# FAIL_ONCE=1 blanks the selftest's proof line before arm (a) asserts, to prove the arm trips.
