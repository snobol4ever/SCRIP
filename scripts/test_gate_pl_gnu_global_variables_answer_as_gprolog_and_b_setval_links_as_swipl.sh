# test_gate_pl_gnu_global_variables_answer_as_gprolog_and_b_setval_links_as_swipl.sh -- GNU Prolog's global
# variables (g_assign, g_assignb, g_link, g_read, g_array_size, g_inc/g_dec/g_inco/g_deco, the bit predicates and the
# g_array/g_array_auto/g_array_extend arrays with their index and argument-selector paths) answer as GNU Prolog does,
# and b_setval/2 LINKS its value as swipl does (cfo 2026-10-08, row prolog-gnu-drivers-find-wrong-answers-bagof-setof-
# through-call-findall-4-for-3-name-2-g-read-and-tell-user, chunk 2).
#
# WHAT THIS PINS. (1) GNU's own driver corpus/packages/prolog/gnu_prolog/BipsPl/g_var_inl_driver.pl against its
# gprolog ref (65 lines: link, copy and array cells, nested arrays, auto-extension to the next power of two, an index
# that is another gvar's integer, Name-K selectors, and the instantiation, type and domain errors in GNU's order), in
# m3 and m4. The family is prelude Prolog over nb_setval/nb_getval/b_setval in the key namespace '$gv:'+Name
# (PL_PRELUDE_SRC in src/parsers/prolog/prolog_parse.c). (2) b_setval/2 stores a LINK to the value, not a copy: a
# variable bound after the store is seen by b_getval, a variable bound through b_getval is the stored one, the store
# is undone on backtracking to the old value, and a run-time key takes the same road (rt_pl_b_set in
# src/runtime/unification.c; the two lowerings in src/lower/lower_prolog.c pass the value as an lvalue).
#
# THE REFS. (1) is the corpus ref beside the driver. (2) is swipl's output, carried here; the gate re-cuts it when
# swipl is on the box and refuses rc=2 on disagreement -- re-cut it from the oracle, never from SCRIP.
#
# RED BEFORE (measured on SCRIP cfcfaf46d, m3 and m4 alike): the driver 15 of 65 lines equal by position (g_assign and
# g_read were a two-clause stub over assertz and a catch with no name check, every other g_* predicate an existence
# error) and the link witness 3 of 9, printing a(f(_G0)): b_setval copied. GREEN AFTER: m3 and m4 byte-identical to
# both refs.
