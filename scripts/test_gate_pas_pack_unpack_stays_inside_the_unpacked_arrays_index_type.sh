# test_gate_pas_pack_unpack_stays_inside_the_unpacked_arrays_index_type.sh -- ISO 7185 6.6.5.4, refused at compile time
#
# MEASURED 2026-09-13 by the coo on origin 93b4d8ed4, both modes, taking row pascal-pat-array-pack-unpack-bounds.
# EIGHT PAT rejection tests were ACCEPTED SILENTLY, rc=0 with no output: pack/unpack given a starting index that is not
# assignment-compatible with the unpacked array's index-type (1726, 1729), a starting index below the array's low bound
# (1867, 1868), a copy that runs off the end mid-way (1728, 1731), and a copy that overruns the end entirely (1869, 1870).
#
# ⛔ SIX OF THE EIGHT ARE MY OWN REGRESSION AND THAT IS WHY THEY ARE HERE: before `0a6e5520a` implemented pack/unpack at
# all, these programs were refused for the unrelated reason that the procedures did not exist, and PAT -- a suite of
# REJECTION tests -- scored that refusal as a PASS. Implementing the feature without its error conditions turned eight
# accidental passes into honest failures. A capability landing owes its ISO error conditions in the same breath.
#
# THE CURE, and why it costs nothing at run time: the Pascal array table never recorded a declared LOW bound (only the
# high), so the pack lowering assumed 1 and could not compare a starting index against the real index-type at all. The
# table now carries `low`, the lowering uses it, and the call site refuses when the touched range [start, start+count-1]
# lies outside [low, high] of the unpacked array, or when the ordinal parameter is a char where the index-type is
# integer. Every witness here has a literal starting index, so every one of these is decided in the parser and no
# generated code changes. ⛔ A RUNTIME check for a VARIABLE index (PAT 1828) is deliberately NOT in this cure: it would
# put a call on every Pascal array access, which is CONCERN 2's surface and an ask to hq_P, not a thing to bolt on here.
#
# ARMS: eight programs from the vendored PAT suite, each required to be REFUSED with a non-empty diagnostic in BOTH
# modes -- the suite's own criterion. A ninth arm proves the cure DISCRIMINATES rather than refusing everything: a legal
# pack over exactly the array's own range still compiles and runs, byte-identical to fpc -Miso. FAIL_ONCE=1 flips the
# first witness's expectation to prove the arm can fail.
