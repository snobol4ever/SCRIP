# Icon large-integer arithmetic, RUNG 0: a fixed integer that OVERFLOWS must promote to a large
# integer rather than wrap in silence. Row icon-bignum-large-integer-arithmetic-ported-from-iconx-rlrgint
# (CEO-318, Lon: "the bignum is just a port of iconx"), ladder rung 39, arizona bignum class.
#
# Measured 2026-09-06 against iconx: `write(2^100)` prints 1267650600228229401496703205376 and SCRIP
# printed 0 -- a WRAP, not a refusal, so every downstream number was quietly wrong. `3^40 * 3^40` printed
# 4389419161382147137 where the oracle prints a 39-digit value.
#
# ⛔ RUNG 0 IS DELIBERATELY NOT THE WHOLE PORT, and the boundary is stated so nobody reads a green here as
# bignum-complete: this rung covers PROMOTION on overflow for + - * ^, decimal rendering, size and
# comparison, and DEMOTION when a result fits again. Rung 1 owns division and remainder (Knuth D), large
# integer LITERALS (the lexer wraps a 20-digit constant today), radix conversion, &random and real
# conversion. Each has its own witnesses cut from iconx; none of them is graded here.
#
# ⭐ THE CONTROL ARMS ARE THE POINT, as with every arithmetic cure: a value that still FITS must print
# exactly as it does today and must not acquire a large-integer spelling. 2^62, plain sums and negative
# products are graded on every run, so a promotion that fires too eagerly is caught here rather than on
# a board. Expectations come from a LIVE iconx run, never hardcoded.
# ⛔ REFUSES rc=2 unless all 18 runs (9 witnesses x 2 modes) are graded, and rc=2 if the oracle is absent.
