"""util_gate_wiring.py -- THE ONE POPULATION OF GATES, and the RATCHET over it.

WHAT IT PROTECTS (row requested by hq_S 2026-09-06, routed by the ceo as CEO-326 because it is a
handoff_status check rather than law).  hq_S's measured case, verbatim: test_gate_sno_fence_body_dynamic_
operand.sh landed on disk IN THE SAME PUSH as the cure it grades, and was never added to the recipe.  For a
day the ONE instrument that can grade that cure was run by nothing.  Nothing could have noticed: the gate was
green when run by hand, ls found it, the commit that added it looked complete, and every board was
byte-identical with and without the cure BY CONSTRUCTION, so no suite could miss it either.  AN UNWIRED GATE
IS INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM A WIRED ONE BY EVERY CHECK EXCEPT READING THE RECIPE.  This is that check.

WHY A RATCHET AND NOT THE CENSUS THAT WAS ASKED FOR.  Measured before a line of it was written: 279
scripts/test_gate_*.sh on disk, 64 reachable from `make test` + `make test-postoffice`.  UNWIRED IS THE NORM,
roughly four out of five.  The check as originally specified -- assert reachable, or exempted with a reason --
would have emitted 215 violations on its first run inside handoff_status.sh, which is a check nobody reads
twice, and a muted check is worse than no check because it looks like coverage.  So it fires on the
TRANSITION, never on the backlog: hq_S's own case is the transition case, and it is the only moment anyone can
act cheaply -- the author is still there, the commit is still open, and wiring it is one line.  Once it is in
the backlog it is a stranger's debt about a cure they did not write.  The backlog is a NUMBER THAT CAN ONLY GO
DOWN (TASK-CEILING), not an alarm.

⭐ THE FLOOR IS A SET OF NAMES, NEVER A COUNT (hq_S's constraint, and it is the one that would have been got
wrong).  169 to 168 with a different name added and an old one dropped is a GREEN RATCHET OVER A REAL
REGRESSION -- the same defect as a board whose total holds while its FAIL set changes underneath.  So the
floor is the sorted NAME SET, and every refusal NAMES the gates that moved.

⭐ AND IT PRINTS THE DIFFERENCE, NOT JUST THE REFUSAL (hq_S, 2026-09-06).  "gate X left the reachable set" is
actionable in one line; "the floor moved" sends its reader to diff two files by hand, and the reader who has
to do that is the reader who mutes the check.  Every refusal class below prints one line per NAME with its own
cure command.

⛔ ONE FILE WITH A CLASS COLUMN, NOT TWO FILES.  hq_S asked for the split by analogy to UNGRADABLE vs UNGRADED
(a gate deliberately out of make test is a RULING -- nobody owes work; a gate nobody has wired yet is a TASK --
somebody can pick it up) and offered either two files or one file with a class column.  ONE FILE, and the
reason decides it: THE FAILURE WE BOTH FEAR IS A NAME THAT APPEARS IN NEITHER LIST, and two files make that
state easy to reach and hard to see.  The property worth protecting is not "each list is right", it is "every
name is in exactly one bucket" -- and only a single population can check that.  Arm SUM is that check.

  WIRED   reachable from the recipe today.  MEASURED, so it carries no reason and needs no declarer.
  RULING  deliberately out of make test.  ⛔ REASON REQUIRED AND REFUSED IF EMPTY, taken at the moment of
          exemption from the person exempting it -- otherwise the exemption list quietly becomes the new
          silent backlog with a tidier name and the same shape as the 215.
  TASK    unwired, nobody has ruled.  This is the debt.  Its size is capped by TASK-CEILING, which `adopt`
          lowers and never raises, so a NEWLY LANDED UNWIRED GATE cannot join it silently -- the author's two
          honest options are WIRE IT or RULE IT WITH A REASON.  Raising the ceiling is a deliberate hand edit
          that leaves a fingerprint in the diff.

⛔ REACHABILITY MEANS EXECUTION, AND THE CLOSURE FOLLOWS LITERAL NAMES ONLY.  A gate reached only because some
census GLOBS scripts/test_gate_*.sh and READS the files (test_gate_runners_refuse_on_a_stale_binary.sh does
exactly this, twice) is not run by anything, and counting it would be the instrument lying in the
comfortable direction.  Comment text is stripped from every line before names are taken, in the Makefile
expansion as well as in the scripts: `make -n` echoes a recipe line's trailing `# ...` comment verbatim
because the shell, not make, owns that `#`, and the first draft of this file scored a gate REACHABLE that
exists only inside such a comment.  Lines beginning `echo`/`printf` are skipped for the same reason -- a gate
NAMED in a diagnostic is not a gate RUN.
