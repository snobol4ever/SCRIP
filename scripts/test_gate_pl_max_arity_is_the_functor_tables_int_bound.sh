# test_gate_pl_max_arity_is_the_functor_tables_int_bound.sh -- the max_arity flag reads 2147483647, the functor table's own
# int bound, and every term-building builtin builds up to it: no fixed cap of 1024 (cfo 2026-10-08, row prolog-max-arity-
# is-a-fixed-cap-of-1024-where-swipl-reads-unbounded-and-builds-an-arity-2000-term; the ceo's ruling CEO-1540, reading B).
#
# WHAT THIS PINS, m3 and m4. The flag and its enumeration read 2147483647 (PROLOG_MAX_ARITY = INT_MAX, rt/prolog_atom.h);
# functor/3 builds arity 2000 and 5000, =../2 builds and takes apart arity 3000 and 5000, copy_term/2 copies arity 4000;
# one past the bound, as an integer and as a bignum, is representation_error(max_arity) from functor/3 and abolish/1 (the
# INRIA goals functor#229, functor-bis#247, abolish#3); set_prolog_flag(max_arity, _) is permission_error(modify, flag,
# max_arity); abolish(foo/2000) succeeds.
#
# THE REF IS THE RULING'S, NOT AN ORACLE'S. swipl 9 builds the same terms but reads the flag as the atom unbounded (so its
# A + 1 is a type_error), names its bignum error size_t, and refuses abolish(foo/2000) with its own max_procedure_arity;
# CEO-1540 chose the integer bound so the INRIA goals stay green, and ISO states the representation and permission errors
# this ref carries.
#
# RED BEFORE (SCRIP 82db2d5aa, the parent): the flag reads 1024 and functor/3 at 2000, =../2 at 3000 and 5000 and
# copy_term at 4000 raise representation_error(max_arity). GREEN AFTER: m3 and m4 byte-identical to the ref.
