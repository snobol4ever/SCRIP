# icon-deal-the-shuffle-and-random-path-is-twenty-times-slower-than-iconx-in-both-modes (step 2, deal's own compute).
#
# WHAT WAS THERE. deal's shuffle is every !x :=: ?x, and rt_swap_var did it as two full substring assignments: dereference
# both sides (each a fresh one-character string), rebuild the whole subject for the first side, rebuild it again for the
# second, copy each right-hand side only to return it, then dereference the left side once more -- nine heap blocks and
# about 1900 instructions per swap, 29% of deal's instructions at a 256 MB arena. Separately, the swap's same-variable test
# looked only through a trap-form variable reference, so two sections of one local of unequal length (s[1:3] :=: s[4:5])
# never had the second position shifted by the first assignment, and the result differed from iconx's.
#
# WHAT IS HERE. A one-character trapped substring reads as the constant one-character string for its byte (a 256-entry
# static table; a trap of any other length still copies). Two one-character traps over the same variable cell -- a local,
# a global, a list slot, reached through either form of variable reference -- are swapped by building ONE new
# subject with the two bytes exchanged and storing it once; every other shape takes the two-assignment path, whose
# same-variable test now reads the base cell through either form too.
#
# ARMS. (1) STRUCTURE: the one-character read, the same-cell fast path and the widened same-variable test are present.
# (2) BEHAVIOUR, both media, against the LIVE oracle (icont/iconx 9.5.25a): a witness of 30 swaps over locals, a global, list
# elements, a table element, sections of unequal length, a NUL-carrying subject, equal positions, swaps between two
# variables, a shuffle procedure and a seeded random loop -- stdout byte-identical. (3) ALLOCATION, both media: the heap's
# own block count (no collection in a 256 MB arena) grows by exactly 3 per swap of ?s :=: ?s -- the two traps and the one
# new subject; it was 9 before.
