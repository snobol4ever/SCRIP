# scripts/lib_raku_roast_bucket.sh -- THE ONE BUCKET AUTHORITY FOR THE RAKU ROAST TREE (hq_raku 2026-09-16).
# Extracted VERBATIM from raku_roast_scoreboard.sh's --inventory arm on the lib_ladder.sh / lib_port_trace.sh
# precedent: one body, sourced, never a second copy. It exists because the ABLATION RANKER must decide
# "did this file move into a GRADED bucket" using the SAME rule the inventory used to say it was dark --
# and a ranker carrying its own private copy of that rule would be free to disagree with the census it is
# ranking, silently and in the flattering direction.
# ⛔ WHY AN EXTRACTION AND NOT A REIMPLEMENTATION: the measurement this feeds is "files moved into a graded
# bucket", which is a DIFFERENCE between two classifications. A difference taken across two copies of a
# classifier measures the copies as much as the cure -- so the two arms must be the same bytes, not merely
# the same intent (CLAUDE.md § Testing: shared authorities are sourced rather than reimplemented).
# Contract: classify <stdout> <stderr> <rc> -> PASS|FAIL|PARSE-FAIL|CRASH|NO-TAP  (the TAP verdict)
#           roast_bucket <stdout> <stderr> <rc> -> GRADED-PASS|GRADED-FAIL|UNGRADED-PARSE|UNGRADED-LEX|UNGRADED-EMITTER|
#                                                  UNGRADED-NO-TAP|UNGRADED-OTHER|UNGRADABLE-TIMEOUT

  # ⛔⭐⭐ A LEX FAILURE IS A FRONT-END FAILURE AND THIS FUNCTION HAD NO NAME FOR IT, SO 61 FILES SAT IN
  # BUCKETS THAT DESCRIBED A LATER STAGE (hq_raku 2026-09-16, found by the parse census this landed beside:
  # its OTHER class -- rc!=0 with no "parse error" text -- came back 61 files, and every one of them has
  # `raku lex error` on the first line of stderr).
  # ⛔ WHERE THEY WERE AND WHY THE NAME LIES. MEASURED over exactly those 61 under --run, before and after
  # this arm: all 61 read UNGRADED-OTHER, and all 61 now read UNGRADED-LEX. UNGRADED-OTHER reads "it failed
  # some way we have no name for" about a class we can name exactly, so a reader triaging that bucket goes
  # looking for a defect in a stage the file never reached.
  # ⛔⭐⭐ AND THE NUMBER IN THIS COMMENT WAS WRONG ONCE BEFORE IT WAS RIGHT, FOR A REASON WORTH MORE THAN
  # THE CURE. It first read "53 UNGRADED-OTHER and 8 UNGRADED-NO-TAP", measured by sourcing this file into
  # the measuring session's OWN shell and calling roast_bucket there. That shell had a `grep` SHELL FUNCTION
  # (the agent harness routes grep to ugrep -I), and ugrep -I calls a line carrying an invalid UTF-8 byte
  # BINARY and answers NO MATCH -- so seven lex diagnostics about invalid bytes silently failed to match the
  # ASCII words `lex error`. A child process never sees a shell function: every script here gets /usr/bin/grep
  # (GNU 3.11), which matches them all. The split was an artifact of the measuring environment and existed
  # nowhere in the tree; re-measured through `bash <probe>` the answer is 61 and 0.
  # ⭐ THE REUSABLE PART: SOURCING A LIBRARY INTO YOUR OWN SHELL IS NOT RUNNING IT. It inherits your
  # functions, aliases and locale, so it can answer differently than it ever will in production -- and it
  # answers plausibly, which is why nothing looked wrong. Measure a script the way the script runs: in a
  # child process. This was nearly landed as a 20-line `grep -a` cure with a fabricated witness attached.
  # ⭐ THIS IS THE CTO'S OWN RULING BITING THE FUNCTION THAT PROVOKED IT (2026-09-16): a bucket named for a
  # stage names what it CAN RECOGNISE, not what the program REACHED. The same shape is already recorded two
  # comments down (`rc -ge 124` filing every SIGSEGV under a bucket named for the clock) and it is recorded
  # in the baton as the reason parse coverage was published as 143 when it was 66 -- because the complement
  # of UNGRADED-PARSE counted as "parsed" every file that failed for a reason this rule had no name for.
  # Three instances, one function: the cure is always to give the unnamed class its own name.
  # ⛔ IT MOVES NO TOTAL AND NO FRACTION: UNGRADED-LEX carries the UNGRADED- prefix, so the inventory's
  # graded/ungraded/ungradable split, its closing identity and every published number are byte-for-byte what
  # they were. Only the 61 files' NAME changes, which is the whole point -- they were never miscounted, they
  # were misdescribed, and a misdescribed file is one nobody can triage.
  # ⛔ IT IS TESTED ON head -1 DELIBERATELY, like the parse arm above it: these files carry `lex error` on
  # line 1 and a bare `parse error in <file>` on line 2, so a whole-stderr grep would file them as parse
  # failures and hand the ablation ranker 61 files whose dying line is not a construct it can ablate.

  # ⛔⭐⭐ A CRASH IS NOT A TIMEOUT, AND THIS LINE CALLED EVERY SIGNAL DEATH A TIMEOUT (hq_raku
  # 2026-09-16, found by doing what the baton said: TIME the three UNGRADABLE-TIMEOUT files before
  # classifying them). `rc -ge 124` is true for 124 (timeout fired) AND for 134 (SIGABRT) AND 139 (SIGSEGV),
  # so every crash landed in a bucket named for the clock. THE MEASUREMENT: all three "timeout" files finish
  # in ~1.4s -- rc=134, rc=139, rc=139. None of them was ever slow. Our front end crashes on them.
  # ⛔ THE CONSEQUENCE IS THE WHOLE POINT, NOT THE LABEL: UNGRADABLE- reads as "not our problem, out of
  # the numerator honestly" (the oracle refuses it, it needs input we do not ship). A compiler that SIGSEGVs
  # is our defect and belongs in the DARK count where it is owed, not in the excused one. Three files were
  # sitting in the excused column with a SIGSEGV behind them.
  # ⭐ AND THE INFORMATION WAS ALREADY IN THE BUILDING: classify() below returns "CRASH" for exactly this
  # condition. The bucket layer re-tested the same rc and overwrote a correct name with a worse one -- which
  # also made classify()'s CRASH arm dead code on the roast path. When two layers classify the same fact,
  # the outer one silently wins, so they must not both decide.

# ⛔⭐ THE POPULATION RESOLVER, SHARED FOR THE SAME REASON THE BUCKET RULE IS (hq_raku 2026-09-16):
# an instrument that RANKS a census must grade the same files the census graded. Resolution order is
# per-root refs/ FIRST (a root still carrying its own gitignored copy keeps grading that copy, so this
# moves no existing measurement), then the shared read-only tree under /home/resources, then an explicit
# env override. ⛔ REFUSES naming every candidate tried, rather than grading a population nobody chose.

  # own fail-once arm). It used to be returned unvalidated, so RAKU_ROAST_TREE=/nonexistent resolved happily
  # and the caller refused several steps later with "censused ZERO files" -- a true refusal naming the wrong
  # cause, which is the shape that sends the next seat to look at the census loop instead of at their env.
