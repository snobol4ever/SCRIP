# test_gate_build_freshness_is_behavioural.sh -- THE BEHAVIOUR PROBE, GATED.
#
# ⛔⭐ THE CLASS (FINDING-2026-09-09-hq_P-a-completed-make-produced-a-binary-that-did-not-match-its-own-templates.md):
# a full `make` reported "Built: scrip" after compiling 198 objects and handed back a compiler that emitted code its own
# template sources do not describe. Three builds on ONE commit produced TWO different compilers. Every freshness check
# on the box PASSED throughout, and two SCORE rows were published from the bad build before an unrelated source edit
# exposed it.
#
# ⛔⭐ WHY THE MTIME GUARD CANNOT SEE IT, WHICH IS STRUCTURAL: the artifacts it stamps are touched by the ACT OF RUNNING
# make, not by the build being right. `scrip`'s only prerequisite is the PHONY `libscrip_rt`, so it relinks on EVERY
# make; `out/libscrip_rt.so` carries FORCE, so its symlink is re-pointed on EVERY make; and $(RT_SO) relinks whenever
# ANY ONE of 269 objects changed. One stale object among 269 therefore leaves every artifact newer than every source.
# ⭐ REPRODUCED DETERMINISTICALLY (hq_T 2026-09-09) and it is arm 6 of this gate: edit a template, make, revert the
# source, touch the object forward so make skips it, touch a second object so the .so relinks -- `make` completes,
# `git status src/` is EMPTY, the binary answers `type=integer image=0` where the tree says `null / &null`, and
# util_require_fresh's mtime half returns rc=0. The probe returns rc=2.
#
# ⭐ WHAT THE PROBE PROVES, STATED HONESTLY: it is a SELF-PIN in exactly the sense CEO-395 draws for master refs -- the
# emitted code HAS NOT MOVED under a tree that HAS NOT MOVED. It says nothing about whether that code is RIGHT; the
# oracle diffs do that. That narrow claim is the one the FINDING needed and could not get.
#
# HERMETIC: arms 1-8 run against a SCRATCH root (tiny src/, a Makefile, scripts/ and scrip symlinked in) so the live
# out/build_behaviour.sig is never written and no rebuild is needed. ~1s, offline.
