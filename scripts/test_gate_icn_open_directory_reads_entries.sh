# Icon open(<directory>) READS THE DIRECTORY'S ENTRIES. Row: the CEO-516 item-2 held three
# (rung36_jcon_recent). Exposed by the jcon suite, cured by hq_I 2026-09-10.
#
# THE DEFECT THIS PINS, in two parts -- the second is the one a plausible cure gets wrong:
#  (1) open(".") SUCCEEDED and then yielded NOTHING. fopen() on a directory succeeds on Linux, so
#      open() returned a healthy handle and every read() off it failed -- "entries read: 0" while
#      type(f) == "file". Not a diagnostic anywhere; the program simply found no files.
#  (2) reads(f, n) ON A DIRECTORY RETURNS ONE ENTRY, truncated to n -- NOT n raw bytes. iconx does
#      not treat a directory as a byte stream. The first cure here snapshotted the entries into a
#      tmpfile, which fixed (1) and left (2) wrong: reads(f,25) then spanned entry boundaries and
#      returned "Makefile\nrecent.dat\nrecen", so a name-membership test found 3 of 5 names instead
#      of 5. rung36_jcon_recent reads in a read/!f/reads rotation and is exactly what caught it --
#      its own comment ("assumes no name longer than 25") is the upstream author saying reads()
#      returns one name.
#
# ⛔ WHY BOTH ARMS RUN IN ONE DIRECTORY, SAME INODE. A directory listing is readdir order, which is
# per-directory: two directories holding the same NAMES can enumerate in different ORDER, and any
# byte-offset-sensitive read over them then diverges legitimately. Grading the oracle in one temp
# dir against SCRIP in another measured that difference and reported it as a defect (3 "missing"
# lines that were nothing of the kind) until both arms were moved into the same directory. The
# oracle's compiled binary is deliberately kept OUTSIDE the run directory, since it would otherwise
# be an entry on one side only -- the same confound wearing a smaller face.
# ⭐ ARM A is order-INDEPENDENT by construction (it collects entries into a set and prints them
# sorted), so it cannot go red on a filesystem that enumerates differently. ARM B is deliberately
# order-SENSITIVE-FREE too: it asserts one entry per reads() by shape (no embedded newline, and the
# set of names complete), never by position.
# ⛔ A GATE THAT CANNOT MEASURE REFUSES rc=2 -- all 4 runs (2 witnesses x 2 modes) must be graded.
# ⭐ NEGATIVE-TESTED AS A DISCRIMINATOR (CEO-510), both parts separately: with rt_dir_snapshot's
# call site removed, ARM A goes RED in both modes ("entries read: 0"); with only the reads() 'd'
# branch removed, ARM A stays GREEN and ARM B goes RED with 25-char chunks carrying newlines --
# which is the point of having two arms, because part (2) is invisible to part (1)'s witness.
