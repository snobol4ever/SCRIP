# test_gate_suite_argv_sidecar.sh — the invariant gate for the suite format's PROGRAM-ARGUMENTS sidecar
# (row `icon-suite-format-has-no-argv-sidecar-so-argv-taking-witnesses-are-ungradable`, hq_T 2026-09-06,
# dispatched by hq_I; found by seat03 on procedure_scan_while_1, both halves verified by hq_B).
#
# WHAT IT PROTECTS. corpus_suite_harness.py's suite format carried a stdin sidecar and a want-rc sidecar
# and NO ARGV SIDECAR, so run_suite_entry() ran every entry with an EMPTY argv and had no way to say
# otherwise. ⛔⭐ THE DAMAGE IS NOT A RED BOARD — IT IS A GREEN ONE. An Icon witness written
# `n := integer(args[1]) | 6` runs to completion with no arguments at all: it takes the `| 6` default,
# prints the expected text, and the suite scores it PASS. The argument handling the witness exists to
# exercise was never executed, and nothing anywhere says so. That is a pass that documents nothing, and
# it is invisible to every gate in the tree — including this file's ancestors — because a criterion that
# is never evaluated looks exactly like a criterion that was satisfied.
#
# ⛔ AND THE FIRST WITNESS WORE THE WRONG EXPLANATION. procedure_scan_while_1 carried an `.xfail` marker
# reading as "the compiler is known-red here" when the compiler was CORRECT — verified: the driver has
# always passed argv (`scrip p.icn -- -n10 foo` -> argc=2, both args in order), and the harness simply
# had nowhere to declare them. A marker naming a defect that does not exist is a FALSE marker, and the
# stale-marker gate cannot see it: it checks whether a marked entry still fails, never whether the
# reason is true. So the sidecar is the cure and this gate is what keeps the cure honest.
#
# ⭐⭐ THE LOAD-BEARING ARM IS ARM 1, AND IT IS WRITTEN THE ONLY WAY THAT PROVES ANYTHING: the SAME
# entry is graded TWICE against the SAME .ref, once with the sidecar present and once with it renamed
# away. The sidecar run must PASS and the sidecar-less run must FAIL. A gate that only asserted "with
# the sidecar it passes" would go green against a harness that ignored the file entirely — the exact
# failure the sidecar was written against, reproduced inside its own gate.
