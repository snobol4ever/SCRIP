# SNOBOL4 IMMEDIATE deferred capture with a target that can never yield a name -- P $ *(N = N + 1) --
# must FAIL THE MATCH, not abort. SPITBOL evaluates the expression and then fails the match; SCRIP
# reached rt_assign_var with a value where a variable is required and died:
#   [IDX] BOMB rt_assign_var: lvalue is not a variable (dtype=3)   rc=134, core dumped
# Row snobol4-immediate-deferred-capture-with-a-non-name-target-bombs-instead-of-failing-the-match.
#
# ⭐ THE CONDITIONAL TWIN IS ALREADY CORRECT AND IS GRADED HERE AS A CONTROL ARM: P . *(N = N + 1)
# agrees with the oracle today (pattern_match.c, `strict && !by_name` sets rc=1 so the match fails
# at END). It is both the model for the cure and the thing a cure must not break -- if the immediate
# form is fixed by making every non-name target abort earlier, this arm goes red and says so.
#
# ⛔⭐⭐ WIDENED 2026-09-05 BY hq_S, AND THE REASON IS THE POINT OF THE INSTRUMENT: the two-witness
# version of this gate WENT GREEN ON A WRONG CURE. Giving the immediate arm the deferred arm's refusal
# and failing the node through the existing rt_cap_fail_retreat retreat path kills the core dump and
# prints NOMATCH -- and is wrong. Measured against sbl -bf: a target that FAILS makes the node RECEDE
# (unanchored, one evaluation per scan position, N=3), while a target that returns a VALUE ABORTS THE
# WHOLE MATCH (N=1 -- the scanner does not advance, an outer alternation is not tried, an ARB does not
# give back). Both print NOMATCH on the original anchored deterministic LEN(1) witness, so NOTHING in
# the two-witness gate could separate them; only the SIDE-EFFECT COUNT differs. The arms below exist to
# make that difference sayable. ⛔ Do not narrow this gate back to "it does not bomb".
#
# ⛔⭐ WITNESSES VERSUS CONTROLS -- READ THIS BEFORE YOU PRUNE A GREEN ARM. The 12 are two kinds and the
# distinction is load-bearing. The 8 WITNESSES were each PROVEN RED on clean main (measured 2026-09-05, SCRIP
# f3f8e252b, gate rc=1, 24 runs graded, 16 red runs) -- an arm that has never been red proves nothing about the
# property it claims. The 4 CONTROLS are GREEN ON MAIN **BY DESIGN** and must stay green after: they exist to
# catch a cure that OVER-REACHES, and the red-once test does not apply to them. ⛔ Do not delete a control for
# being green -- that is the same mistake as narrowing this gate to "it does not bomb", arriving from the other
# side. The measured near-miss they guard against is real: the first cure attempted here made every non-name
# target RETREAT, and `recede_when_target_fails` plus `conditional` are what would have caught the mirror-image
# error of making every non-name target abort earlier, which is the failure hq_B named when handing the row over.
#
# ⛔ AND THE NESTING ARMS ARE NOT DECORATION: a capture target may itself open a match, and the abort of
# an INNER match must not reach the outer one. The first cure passed n_nest_ok and n_nest_inner_ends and
# failed n_nest_inner_dies -- the discriminator is whether the inner match reaches its own END. Per-match
# state stamped with g_cap_gen is NOT enough on its own: nothing restores g_cap_gen across a nested match
# today (zeta_storage.c says head.capgen_save is restored through rt_match_ctx_restore; that function
# ignores its capgen argument entirely -- rtx_match.s). Routed to hq_U; this gate holds the line meanwhile.
#
# The expectation is not hardcoded: the oracle is RUN, so this gate cannot drift from it. sbl needs
# -bf (case-sensitive, matching SCRIP) and a writable listing sink, or it dumps its listing to stdout.
# ⛔ REFUSES rc=2 unless EVERY witness is graded in BOTH modes, and rc=2 if the oracle is absent or its
# own run fails -- a missing oracle prints a full, plausible, entirely false table.
