# test_gate_package_runners_print_the_inventory.sh — the invariant gate for THE PACKAGE LOCKDOWN's
# instrument (row every-package-runner-prints-shipped-graded-ungraded-and-ungradable-and-the-leaderboard-
# carries-the-inventory, hq_T 2026-09-06, rank 0 on the ceo's order; Lon: "Fix the never graded business.
# Let's lock down our package testing and make it complete.").
#
# WHAT IT PROTECTS. Every lockdown row's DONE-WHEN is `ungraded=0`, so the number that criterion reads is
# load-bearing for the whole fleet. ⛔ THE FAILURE IT GUARDS AGAINST IS NOT A WRONG COUNT — it is a
# program that lands in NO bucket at all and therefore never appears in any number. Measured on the first
# run against a real package: icon/ipl ships 852 .icn files, 211 are declared in UNGRADED.tsv, and 641
# were in no bucket whatsoever. Not red, not skipped, not owed — simply absent, which is exactly the
# "never graded business" the order exists to end.
#
# ⭐⭐ SO THE LOAD-BEARING PROPERTY IS THE SUM, NOT ANY BUCKET. graded + ungraded + ungradable must equal
# shipped. Without that, the line is four independent opinions, each individually plausible, and the
# absent 641 are invisible in all four. A gate that only checked "does the runner print a line" would go
# green on an inventory that omits three quarters of the package.
#
# ⭐ AND THE SUM IS WHY `gap=` HAD TO SPLIT. Four runners printed `shipped/graded/gap`; `gap` held both
# "not graded YET" (work owed) and "CANNOT be graded" (a ruling). While an ungradable program sits inside
# gap, `ungraded=0` is UNREACHABLE BY BEING CORRECT — a lane does every piece of real work available and
# still never reaches its own criterion.

# exits at the first match, SIGPIPEs the printf, and the pipeline reports 141. Whether printf finishes
# first is a RACE, so the answer depended on scheduling.
# ⭐⭐ WHY THIS OUTRANKS THE WRONG COUNT: this is the arm that catches a STALE declaration — a ruling
# that no longer names a file. Under the race it accused 211 live files at once, so a real stale entry
# was indistinguishable from the noise, and the honest response to the refusal was to disbelieve it.
# ⛔ AND IT COULD NOT BE SEEN AT FIXTURE SCALE: with three files printf always wins, so every arm above
# passed on the day it landed. hq_I's rule, from the arizona determinism case the same morning: A CHECK
# THAT CANNOT FAIL FOR THE REASON YOU ARE ASKING ABOUT IS NOT A WEAK CHECK. ⭐ This arm was itself written
# wrong once and caught by that rule: at 600 short names it passed against the KNOWN-BAD body, because the
# defect needs the pipe to actually fill. Five INDEPENDENT runs are compared against each other — never a
# back-to-back pair inside one process, hq_I's other measured warning from the same morning.

# BUFFER (800 long names = 72000 bytes) and the declared name must match EARLY, so `grep -q` exits while
# `printf` is still writing. With three short names printf's whole output fits in one buffer, it never
# blocks, EPIPE never happens, and the arm silently grades nothing — which is why eleven arms passed over

# transcribed). Every arm above grades what the RUNNER writes. This one grades what the READER does with it,
# because carriage that nothing reads is not carriage. `inventory_clauses()` is keyed by the runner's token
# and `PROGRESS_COUNTED` by the display label, and three pairs differ today: pat/PAT, gnu_prolog/gnu,
# snoflake_suite/snoflake. A 2026-09-06 cure matched them for the DENOMINATOR and left `name in inv` spelled
# at the other two sites, so the reader printed "⚠ PAT carries NO PACKAGE_INVENTORY clause ... Retrofit the
# runner and paste its own line into the cell" about a clause sitting in the cell it had just parsed -- a
# work item for work already done, issued by the only instrument that could have reported it.
# ⛔ AND THE QUIETER HALF IS THE ONE THIS GATE EXISTS FOR: on a miss the shipped population fell through to
# the PACKAGE_SHIPPED dict, which holds no entry for those languages, so shipped read 0 and THE UNGRADED
# REMAINDER WAS NEVER BOOKED AS NOT-RUN. A package could ship 851 and grade 89 and contribute no inventory
# at all -- the never-graded business, hidden by a spelling, inside the function written to end it.
# ⭐ HERMETIC AND MUTATION-PROVED: the fixture is a V cell built here, never the live board, and the arm was
# confirmed to RED against an ablated reader (the matched join reverted to the spelled one) before landing.

# ⚠ REPORTED, NOT COUNTED, WHILE THE ROW RAMPS: the instrument landed before its callers, so naming them
# is the work list, not a verdict. ⭐ It prints the denominator rather than a boolean for the reason the
# stale-binary gate's census arm does: that arm caught THIS author shipping a gate with no freshness
# guard on the day it landed (gates=97 wired=96 uncovered=1), which a boolean could not have done.
# ⛔⭐⭐ AND IT COUNTS WHAT IT CAN PROVE, IN THREE TIERS, BECAUSE "WIRED" WAS A CLAIM THIS GATE COULD NOT
# SUPPORT (hq_I, 2026-09-06, and they were right). It greps for the stanza, so it counted runners that
# COULD emit a line, not runners that DO -- and those differed for EVERY runner wired so far. jcon is the
# worked case: it sourced the body and called it, the census said wired=1, and it could not emit a line at
# all, because its UNGRADED.tsv was 2-column and its call SWALLOWED the refusal into a warning. A number
# that is wrong for every member of its population is not a census, and the ceo has since made this report
# load-bearing under Lon's order, which is the worst moment to be carrying an unprovable claim.
# ⭐ STATIC ANALYSIS CANNOT PROVE EMISSION -- only running the runner does, and that is board_packages.sh's
# job, not a 2-second mktemp-only gate's. So the honest move is not a cleverer grep: it is to stop printing
# one number, print the three that ARE decidable from the source, and name the gap the gate cannot close.

# ⛔⭐⭐ ARM 19 — THE LIVE BOARD, AND IT IS RATCHETED BY NAME (hq_T 2026-09-10, row package-shipped-per-lane-
# printed-by-the-runner-not-transcribed). ARM 17 grades the CARRIAGE (does the runner splice its clause) and
# ARM 18 grades the READER (does the join find it), and both are hermetic — ARM 18 builds its own V cell and
# deliberately never opens SCORE.md. That is right for a unit arm and it left exactly one thing ungraded:
# THE BOARD ITSELF. ⛔ THE MEASURED WITNESS, and it is why this arm exists: jcon's runner-written clause was
# cured onto the board at .github `9c5f53b5` and was GONE by `03c6ca3a` six hours later — a rebase-conflict
# resolution that took the older side restored the pre-cure prose verbatim, digits and all ("of 91 shipped,
# 76 graded, 15 ungraded"), on a cell whose true reading was 78 graded / 13 not. Every arm above stayed
# green through it: the runner still carried its clause, the reader still joined correctly, and the only
# instrument that could see the loss was the row's own DONE-WHEN, which lives in a baton and runs when a
# seat happens to read it. ⭐ THE GENERAL FORM: a cure that lands in a FILE is protected by the gate that
# grades the file; a cure that lands in a CELL of a file twelve seats rewrite all day is protected by
# nothing unless something re-reads the cell. Carriage that nothing reads is not carriage — and neither is
# carriage that arrives and is then overwritten.
# ⛔ WHY A PIN BY NAME AND NOT A COUNT. Seven of fifteen packages have no clause today and all seven are
# under a PARKED-LON-HOLD language, so a strict arm would red the whole fleet for work nobody is allowed to
# do. A count would also be a number typed into a script — the very defect this row is about — and a wrong
# one passes silently. A pinned NAME is checkable: every name is verified to still be a package of its lane
# in PROGRESS_COUNTED, so a stale pin REFUSES rc=2 instead of passing, and a lost clause is named directly.
# ⭐ The unpinned remainder is printed as the work list with its denominator, never counted into the verdict
# (ARM 11's doctrine: a gate that red-lights on work not yet done gets switched off by the first person it
# blocks for a good reason). A package that GAINS a clause prints the one-line raise instruction.
# ⭐ HERMETIC WHEN IT NEEDS TO BE: the board path is PKGINV_BOARD, defaulting to the live one, so the arm was
# mutation-proved against a doctored copy (jcon's clause deleted -> RED naming jcon; a pin renamed -> rc=2)
# before landing. ⛔ AND THE CURE IS NEVER A HAND EDIT: re-run the package's own runner, which rewrites the
# cell in place. Restoring a clause by typing it back is this row's defect wearing the cure's clothes.

# ⛔⭐⭐ ARM 20 — THE LIVE SIDECARS, AND THE ARMS ABOVE ALL GRADE FIXTURES (hq_T 2026-09-10, row package-
# shipped-per-lane-printed-by-the-runner-not-transcribed). ARMS 1-16 exercise every refusal in
# lib_inventory.sh against mktemp fixtures, exhaustively and correctly; ARM 11 counts which runners reach
# the body; ARM 17/18 grade carriage and reader; ARM 19 grades the board. NOT ONE of them ever points the
# body at the ELEVEN REAL SIDECAR PAIRS the runners actually read. So the body was gated and its data was
# not, and the gap is not theoretical: it swallowed a live defect for four hours on origin this very day.
# ⛔ THE MEASURED WITNESS. Two seats filed the same ceo ruling (CEO-527, cfuncs/extlvals) into
# arizona_tests/UNGRADABLE.tsv four hours apart, so the file held 38 rows for 36 distinct programs. The
# honesty arm fired first -- not on the duplicate but on the older copy's `SCRIP: 'cannot find ...'`
# evidence clause -- and `inventory_line` for arizona returned rc=2 AT ANY GRADED COUNT.
# ⭐ AND THE CONSEQUENCE IS SILENT BY CONSTRUCTION, which is the half worth understanding rather than
# fixing: every runner does `INV_LINE="$(inventory_line ...)"` and warns to stderr, because a bookkeeping
# failure must never red a board (gate_score_row's own doctrine, and it is right). An empty INV_LINE
# contributes nothing to the `--text` splice, so the cell reverts from a runner-written PACKAGE_INVENTORY
# clause to transcribed prose, and the runner's exit status never moves. ⛔ A DATA-FILE WORDING CHANGE
# THEREFORE STRIPS A LEADERBOARD CELL'S PROVENANCE WITH EVERY GATE GREEN. ARM 19 does catch it -- it is how
# arizona and ipl were found -- but only one board pass later, from another seat's tree, naming a symptom
# ("its shipped population is transcribed again") a lane away from the .tsv line that caused it.
# ⭐ THE GENERAL FORM, and it is ARM 19's own lesson one level down: ARM 19 says a cure landing in a CELL is
# protected by nothing unless something re-reads the cell. The sibling is that A REFUSAL DELIBERATELY MADE
# NON-FATAL IS PROTECTED BY NOTHING UNLESS SOMETHING CALLS IT ON PURPOSE. Non-fatal is the correct design
# and it converts a loud instrument into a quiet one at exactly the moment it fires; the cure is not to make
# it fatal in the runner, it is to call the same body somewhere a red is free -- here, hermetically, in <1s.
# ⛔ THIS ARM DELIBERATELY DOES NOT GRADE THE ARITHMETIC, and says so rather than letting a reader assume
# it: the bucket-sum identity needs a GRADED count, which only a real suite pass produces, and under ONE
# RUNNER ONE BOARD (CEO-523) this gate may not run one. So it feeds each package the graded count that makes
# its own sum hold, which lets every OTHER arm of the body speak -- honesty, internal duplicates, both-files,
# missing reason, closed vocabulary, stale name, moved package. The arithmetic stays the runner's to fail.
# ⭐ EXTENSION COMES FROM THE DATA, NEVER FROM A LANG->EXT MAP: each sidecar's own name column carries it
# (`general/cfuncs.icn`), all eleven self-describe exactly one, and each agrees with its runner's INV_EXT.
# A map in this script would be one more number typed into a gate, which is this row's whole subject; a

# ⛔⭐⭐ ARM 21 — THE CAUSE READER (hq_T 2026-09-11, same row). ARM 20 proves the shared body ACCEPTS each
# package's live data. It does not answer the question a reader actually arrives with when a board cell has
# no runner-written clause: WHY NOT. That question was answered by an ENUMERATION inside util_score_row.py
# -- a list of causes, maintained by hand -- and the list has now been wrong twice, in the same direction,
# each time after being cured: it named ONE cause on 2026-09-10 and was wrong for both packages it reported
# (arizona and ipl were wired; their bodies had REFUSED), was cured to TWO, and on 2026-09-11 both named
# causes were wrong for FOUR of the seven it reports -- snobol4's gimpel/aisnobol/dotnet/testpgms are wired
# AND validate, and are prose only because no suite pass has rewritten them since the carriage landed.
# ⭐⭐ THE GENERAL FORM: A DIAGNOSTIC THAT CAN ONLY OBSERVE AN ABSENCE MUST ENUMERATE EVERY CAUSE OF THE
# ABSENCE, AND ENUMERATING FROM MEMORY IS HOW YOU GET TWO OF FOUR. Every list was written by someone who had
# just measured the cause in front of them and generalised; each read as more rigorous than the last and
# stayed wrong. ⛔ A wrong cause is a WORK LIST, not a wording: this row's own baton sent its next reader to
# retrofit four runners whose carriage had been correct and pushed for days.
# ⭐ SO THE CURE WAS TO STOP ENUMERATING AND MEASURE -- util_package_inventory_cause.sh -- and THIS arm is
# what keeps that instrument honest. It is HERMETIC BY CONSTRUCTION and grades the reader's DISCRIMINATION,
# not the live tree: ARM 20 already grades the live sidecars, and the live causes are printed by
# util_package_shipped_is_runner_written.sh, which is this row's DONE-WHEN and where a red is already free.
# ⛔ DELIBERATELY NOT A LIVE SWEEP, and the number is why: calling the cause reader for all 15 declared
# packages costs 7.1s on this box at load ~4 (24.4s before its per-runner grep loop was collapsed to one
# pass), against a gate that already costs 7.7s. An arm that doubles a blocking gate to re-derive what two
# other instruments already print is not diligence.
