# test_gate_gc_mark_worklist_visits_typed_layouts_not_words.sh -- THE MARK WORKLIST VISITS EVERY HEAP BLOCK BY ITS KIND'S LAYOUT,
# NEVER BY SNIFFING ITS WORDS (cfo 2026-10-01; row gc-the-mark-worklist-walks-typed-visitors-not-words-every-heap-block-kind-has-a-layout-
# and-hb-ws-is-split-by-allocation-site; Lon 2026-09-17 CEO-812/815, Rule 2b of ARCH-GC-COMPILE-TIME-FRAME-MAPS.md).
# THE DEFECT IT HOLDS SHUT: on db4a6b1fc the worklist handed every marked HB_WS, HB_DINST, HB_ARR and HB_PLJ payload to the sniffing
# frame scan -- a heap-interior word scan with the 16-byte descriptor sniff -- and hq_raku's witness read DATINST_t.type as 0xdbdbdbdb
# after a slide (benchmark_point_class_add m3 CRASH under the poison fill). The cure landed in pieces (hb_scan_interior deleted, HB_WS
# split into kind-named allocators: HB_WSB raw bytes, HB_WSC chars, HB_DVEC descriptors, HB_PVEC pointers, ...); this gate is what the row
# owed so the shape cannot quietly come back.
# ARMS: (1) KIND COVERAGE, static: every `#define HB_<KIND> <n>` in gc_heap.h is named in the mark loop's dispatch (the region from
# `while (g_gc_mhead)` to `if (g_gc_wln == 0) break;` in gc_heap.c) by an equality, a range, or the pointer-free leaf line -- a kind
# no visitor names would fall to the interior counter; PLANT: the same reader over gc_heap.h plus an injected kind must name it missing.
# (2) NO UNTYPED ALLOCATION, static: zero calls of the retired rt_ws_alloc( spelling, and every rt_gcheap_alloc( / rt_gcheap_grow_block(
# call in src/ outside gc_heap.c passes an HB_ constant as its kind; PLANT: the reader must flag a synthetic call with a variable kind.
# (3) THE DATINST WITNESS BY RATE: scripts/fixtures/gc/datinst_point_bless.raku (point_class_add cut to 12 lines: a class whose add
# returns a fresh bless) under SCRIP_GC_POISON=1 SCRIP_GC_STRESS=1, 3 runs per mode, each byte-identical to the ref cut from Rakudo.
# (4) EVERY collection of those runs prints [GC-COV] interior_words=0, and there are at least 1000 per run (40003 measured), else rc 2:
# a witness that does not collect proves nothing. (5) SENSITIVITY: SCRIP_GC_PLANT_PIN_TYPE=<HB_DINST> SCRIP_GC_PLANT_PIN_SKIP=1 frees the
# first live record instance as if no visitor had marked it, and the witness must then NOT print the ref (it aborts or faults in both
# modes, measured); a witness that still answers is blind and the gate refuses rc 2. The same plant on HB_ARR, a kind the witness does
# not hold, answered correctly when measured -- the witness is specific to HB_DINST.
# rc 0 every arm holds · 1 a kind unvisited, an untyped allocation, a wrong answer or a nonzero interior count · 2 could not measure.
