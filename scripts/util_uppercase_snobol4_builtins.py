"""util_uppercase_snobol4_builtins.py -- uppercase SPITBOL builtin names in a case-folded source.

Lon 2026-09-11, in-chat to ceo (CEO-571): "So for case insensitive sources, the solution is to modify
the test source to use uppercase reserved/key-words."

WHY: SPITBOL folds case by default; our one mandated invocation is `sbl -bf`, and -f is case-SENSITIVE
because that is what SCRIP's SNOBOL4 is. A third-party source written in SPITBOL's default idiom (lower
case `end`, `output`) is refused by -bf with "No END statement found in source file(s)". The cure is to
convert the SOURCE, once, in the repo -- never to fold at grade time, because a transform applied inside
a harness run means the artifact we grade is not the artifact in the repo (CEO-567, CEO-570).

WHAT IT TOUCHES: only bare identifiers that match the SPITBOL builtin list below, at word boundaries,
and only OUTSIDE string literals and comments. User identifiers keep their case -- they are consistent
within a file and case-sensitivity does not disturb them. `&keyword` names are uppercased after the `&`.

⛔ THE LIST IS THE INSTRUMENT, AND A NAME MISSING FROM IT IS A SILENT NO-OP ON THAT NAME, never an error here.
`EXIT` was absent until 2026-09-12 (hq_C, the twelve-resisting row): `module.sbl` is ONE statement, `exit(-3,'module.out')`,
and the converter reported 0 changes on it -- a file it could not convert at all, reported the same way as a file that
needed nothing. The miss surfaces only downstream, as ERROR 022 undefined function under -bf, which is why the oracle
proof and not this script's own count is the verdict. When a conversion leaves a file red, SUSPECT THIS LIST FIRST.

⛔ IT PROVES ITSELF OR IT FAILS. This script does not decide whether its own edit was correct; the caller
runs the oracle both ways and compares (see --check in the runner, and the row's DONE-WHEN):
    sbl        ORIGINAL.sbl   (case folding, upstream's own invocation)
    sbl -bf    CONVERTED.sbl  (our mandated arm)
Byte-identical output is the proof. A file whose two runs differ is REPORTED and left unconverted -- it
is a finding, never a silent acceptance.
