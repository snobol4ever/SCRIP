# test_gate_ir_tmp_slots.sh — GROUND ZERO #5 (GOAL-IR-IMMUTABLE-EMIT) B0 keystone lock.
# Pins the JCON ir_Tmp contract that ir_tmp_slot_assign() establishes in LOWER: every value-PRODUCING
# node carries a result slot and every control node does NOT. Checks STRUCTURE, not exact offsets.
# RE-PINNED 2026-07-12: the slot is displayed as the self-column NAME (sN = zls slot N, nN = no slot);
# the older lhs=/tmp= payload tokens are gone (lhs= died at 19cbedd5 when lhs->tmp landed; tmp= died when
# zls naming absorbed it) — this gate was red against both and nobody noticed. ASSIGN is re-pinned as a
# slot CARRIER: assignment is a value in Icon/SNOBOL4 and today's LOWER grants it one (measured, s64).
# Dump kind names are IR_-prefix-less as of 2026-07-12 (Lon directive); slotless nodes render @LINE (Lon:
# numbers in the dump mean SLOTS — node ids are verbose-only), so the noslot arm matches @, never nN.
