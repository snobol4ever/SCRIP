# test_gate_pas_low_and_high_of_a_string_variable.sh -- low(s) and high(s) of a string-typed variable or formal answer as
# fpc does: low(s) is 1 and high(s) is Length(s) for an ansistring/string/widestring/unicodestring; low(s) is 0 and high(s) is 255
# for a shortstring or an OpenString formal; a variable's own declared type wins over a same-named variable in an enclosing scope.
#
# MEASURED 2026-10-03 by hq_pascal, row pascal-every-suite-to-100-under-nonet-ceo-1266. webtbs_tw14941a (FPC) printed its
# first line and halted rc=1: its procedure P(s: OpenString) tests high(s)<>255, and pascal.y's low/high folding knew only
# arrays and ordinal types, so high(s) fell through to an undefined-routine call (webtbs_tw22936, which also tests
# high(ansistring), additionally needs {$ZEROBASEDSTRINGS ON} and stays red -- a flag a new global would carry).
#
# CURE: pascal.y mk_call's low/high arm asks pas_var_string_kind(name), which reads the declaration VISIBLE at the use (the
# scalar-var-type table now records each entry's scope uid, and value/var formals register their string-family types
# through pas_formal_strtypes beside pas_formal_chararrs). Kind 2 (shortstring, openstring) folds high to 255 and low to 0 (the
# length byte is index 0); kind 1 lowers high(s) to Length(s) of a clone of the variable and low to the literal 1.
#
# ARMS, both modes, each program's expected stdout and exit code cut LIVE from fpc: (ansi) low/high of an ansistring that
# changes length; (open) the tw14941a shape, an OpenString formal; (shadow) a formal OpenString and a local shortstring both
# shadow a global ansistring of the same name -- the global's high stays Length(s) after each routine returns, which a
# latest-declaration-wins lookup answers 255. FAIL_ONCE=1 corrupts the shadow arm's ref.
