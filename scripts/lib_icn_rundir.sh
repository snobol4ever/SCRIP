# lib_icn_rundir.sh -- THE ONE AUTHORITY for the RUN DIRECTORY a corpus/tests/icon witness is graded in.
#
# ⛔⛔ WHY THIS EXISTS: several rung36_jcon_* witnesses are REAL-WORLD I/O PROGRAMS that read their own
# working directory, their own source text, their own environment and their own argv. Graded with none of
# that present they still produce a full, plausible, ORDERLY answer -- they just stop early, at the point
# where they gave up. rung36_jcon_recent starved this way prints 313 lines whose LAST line is
# `can't open recent.dat`, and the oracle starved the same way prints the same 313 lines, so the two
# AGREED and the witness read PASS for months (hq_I, FINDING-2026-09-10). ⭐ AGREEING ABOUT WHERE YOU BOTH
# GAVE UP IS NOT AGREEMENT ABOUT THE PROGRAM, and it is invisible to every check a runner normally makes:
# the output is non-empty, well formed, byte-identical and stable across runs.
#
# ⛔ THE THREE RUNNERS EACH CARRIED THEIR OWN COPY of the one line that looked up the stdin sidecar
# (test_icon_all_rungs.sh, test_icon_rung_suite.sh, test_icon_mode4_rung.sh -- byte-identical `[ -f ... ]
# || ...config/...` in all three). That is the shape lib_icon_ipl_isolation.sh's own header names as how
# test_prolog_ladder.sh and its Raku twin silently diverged. A witness whose ref was cut under a contract
# ONE runner honours and another does not is a ref that grades two different programs, so the contract
# has to be readable from exactly one place -- this file.
#
# ⭐ NO NEW SIDECAR FORMATS. argv and fixture files already have a declared format and a written reader in
# lib_icon_ipl_isolation.sh (NAME.argv, NAME.fixtures/), authored for ipl but keyed only on the .icn path.
# This file SOURCES those readers rather than restating them, so a witness fixture cannot mean one thing
# under ipl and another here. Only NAME.env is new, because nothing yet declared environment.
#
# THE CONTRACT, all four parts OPTIONAL and all resolved beside the .icn (stdin additionally falls back to
# the historical config/ location, which is where every existing tests/icon stdin sidecar lives):
#   NAME.stdin  or config/NAME.stdin   bytes fed on stdin           (absent -> /dev/null)
#   NAME.argv                          one line NAME<TAB>arg<TAB>…  (absent -> no program arguments)
#   NAME.fixtures/                     files copied into the rundir (absent -> an empty rundir)
#   NAME.env                           VAR=value per line           (absent -> the caller's environment)
#
# USAGE:
#   . lib_icn_rundir.sh
#   icn_rundir_stdin "$icn"                    # echoes the stdin path, or /dev/null
#   icn_rundir_make  "$icn" "$parent"          # echoes a FRESH rundir under $parent, fixtures staged
#   icn_rundir_argv  "$icn" ARR                # 0 read / 1 none / 2 malformed
#   icn_rundir_env   "$icn" ARR                # 0 read / 1 none / 2 malformed
#   icn_rundir_declares "$icn"                 # 0 if ANY of stdin/argv/fixtures/env is declared
#
# ⛔ EVERY MALFORMED DECLARATION REFUSES WITH 2 AND NEVER FALLS BACK TO "no contract". A witness graded
# under a contract that silently failed to arm is the starvation defect wearing the cure's clothes -- it
# would print the same orderly wrong answer, and this time with a sidecar on disk saying otherwise.

# ⛔⭐⭐ STDIN IS PART OF THE CONTRACT, AND LEAVING IT OUT MADE THE CONTRACT'S OWN GATE BLIND TO IT (hq_P
# 2026-09-10, on the coo's routed finding from the rung36_jcon_io ref cut). This predicate used to test argv,
# fixtures and env ONLY. Two consequences, and the second is the one nobody would have gone looking for:
#   (1) A WITNESS FED ON STDIN RAN IN THE SHARED SCRATCH. Its answer depends on an input that is not in its
#       source, which is the whole definition of environment-dependent, yet it was not a contract-bearing
#       witness -- so it got the cwd whose contents are whatever ran before it. MEASURED on the live corpus:
#       8 witnesses carry a stdin sidecar, 6 of them declared nothing else, and 4 of those 6 have an answer
#       that PROVABLY changes with stdin (btrees, others, prefix, recogn -- discriminated by running each
#       twice with different stdin, with a same-input control first so nondeterminism could not be reported
#       as dependence). rung36_jcon_io asserts that open("tmp1") FAILS; a sibling's litter is a wrong answer.
#   (2) `test_gate_icn_rundir_contract.sh` DISCOVERS ITS POPULATION WITH THIS PREDICATE (`icn_rundir_declares
#       "$icn" && WITNESSES+=(...)`). So the gate that exists to police the run-directory contract could not
#       see a stdin-only witness AT ALL -- it graded 2 of the 8. ⭐ A guard and its own canary must not share
#       a failure mode; here they were the same line of code, so the blind spot was perfectly silent.
# ⛔ THE NAIVE FIX MATCHES NOTHING AND LOOKS LIKE IT WORKED: `[ -e "$base.stdin" ]` finds ZERO of the eight,
# because every stdin sidecar in tests/icon lives in `config/`. The two-place lookup is stated once, in
# icn_sidecar_path, and this predicate must ask THE SAME QUESTION `icn_rundir_stdin` answers -- or the bus
# feeds a file the contract says is not declared, which is the two-instruments-one-question defect again.
# ⛔⭐ A SUITE CONTAINER IS NOT A WITNESS, AND ITS SIDECARS ARE A DIFFERENT CONTRACT WITH THE SAME EXTENSION
# (hq_V 2026-09-12, CEO-604, on hq_T's census: test_gate_icn_rundir_contract REFUSED rc=2 fleet-wide).
# TWO readers share `.argv` and they disagree by design. `NAME.argv` beside a WITNESS `NAME.icn` is ONE
# program's argv and must name NAME -- ipl_argv_read refuses anything else as a copied sidecar arming the
# wrong program, which is a refusal worth having. `ALL.argv` beside the MASTER `ALL.icn` is the PER-ENTRY
# table read by corpus_suite_harness.read_argv_sidecar, keyed on ENTRY names; it names `ALL` nowhere and
# never could. A master is a CONTAINER, never compiled whole (CLAUDE.md), and the same is true of its
# sidecars -- so pointing the witness reader at one is a category error, not a malformed file.
# ⭐ THE DISCRIMINATOR IS THE ENTRY TABLE, NOT THE NAME "ALL": a container is the thing that ships a
# per-entry provenance table beside it. Measured over corpus/tests/icon -- exactly one of the 9 .icn files
# declaring a contract has a sibling .csv, and it is precisely the one being mis-enumerated. A name-based
# test would have to be re-taught every time a family is renamed; this one cannot drift.
