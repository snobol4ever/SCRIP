# THE DEFECT (the cto 2026-10-02, ceo CEO-1425 row snobol4-a-pattern-match-compiled-after-a-call-into-the-icon-section-of-
# one-scriptix-file-crashes, found by Lon's infinite_snobol4 SCRIPtix demo): in one SCRIPtix .md whose SNOBOL4 section is the
# entry, a call into the Icon section followed by any statically compiled pattern match died of SIGSEGV, both modes -- a
# store into the sealed code slab. The SNOBOL4 side keeps its capture-stack pointer in r12 (home cell [0x70000000]) and the
# match prologue pushes through it; the Icon procedure's call-entered stub (xa_flat_dc_stub, <name>_dcα) popped its return
# address into r12 and left by pop r12; jmp r12, so the caller got its r12 back holding the return address.
# THE CURE: no dc stub touches r12 -- rax carries the return address at entry (dead there in every variant), the Icon and
# zframe stubs leave by ret, and the PL-DC stub carries it in r11, which the C leave function it tail-jumps to clobbers anyway.
#
# Two programs x two modes; the expected lines are the SNOBOL4 and Icon semantics, written out. rc=0 clean · rc=1 a
# divergence · rc=2 REFUSAL.
