# test_gate_template_form_census_names_a_planted_two_form_box.sh — the form census names a box that emits two forms,
# the guard that chooses between them and the break-out it needs, and a kind the emitter hands to two boxes
# (hq_templates, row templates-a-form-census-names-every-box-that-serves-more-than-one-ir-form-and-the-split-each-needs,
# ceo CEO-1321; Lon 2026-09-27: "...to consider having other IR/BB broken out properly by form/pattern").
#
# THE FIXTURE. A scratch copy of this tree's src/templates/bb, src/templates/xa and src/emitter/emit.cpp (the real
# tree is never written), read by the census twice: as copied, and after planting
#   bb_zz_planted_two.cpp  if (_.op_zres) return <form 1>; return <form 2>;       -- TWO live forms
#   bb_zz_planted_one.cpp  a lambda whose ternary is a refusal (alpha + bomb) or one form -- ONE live form, one refusal
# and three case labels at the head of walk_bb_node_inner's switch (nd->op): IR_ZZ_PLANTED_A and _B share a group
# handing both to the two-form box; IR_ZZ_PLANTED_C picks between the two boxes on g_emit.op_zres.
# THE ARMS. The copy names no planted box. The planted copy: the two-form box listed with live=2 forms=2, its three
# kinds and two sites, form 1 guarded by _.op_zres and form 2 the otherwise, the break-out naming two one-form boxes;
# the one-form box NOT listed among multi-form boxes and its TSV row reading one live form and one refusal;
# IR_ZZ_PLANTED_C named as a kind the emitter splits across both boxes; the population up by two files and two
# boxes and the verdict up by one multi-form box and one kind case; rc 1. An empty root refuses rc 2; the real tree
# reads rc 0 or 1 over at least 50 files, never 2.
# ⛔ FAIL-ONCE: TEMPLATE_FORMS=<path> points the gate at another census; the landing's proof ran it on a mutant that
# never splits a return, and the gate read RED.
# Usage: bash scripts/test_gate_template_form_census_names_a_planted_two_form_box.sh
