# snobol4-a-right-sealed-defer-tears-down-its-zeta-frame-twice (cto 2026-09-11, CEO-564: the snobol4-master
# 16 CRASH + 8 HANG class).
#
# THE DEFECT: a MATCH_DEFER whose referenced pattern is RIGHT-SEALED -- its rightmost element is a FENCE, so
# backtracking into it can never yield another alternative (lower_snobol4.c sno_pat_right_sealed -> nd->seal=1)
# -- is given a ζ-ACTIVATION FRAME by bb_match_defer.cpp: α does `push rbp; mov rbp,rsp`, and BOTH of its exits
# tear it down, γ at L(4) and ω at L(5), each `mov rsp,rbp; pop rbp`. The β (recede) port did the teardown A
# SECOND TIME before failing on to ω. ⛔ β IS ONLY EVER ENTERED AFTER γ HAS ALREADY POPPED THE FRAME -- it is
# the consumer downstream of γ receding back into this box -- so by then rbp holds the CALLER's frame base:
# `mov rsp,rbp` moves rsp to a wild place, `pop rbp` takes a word off it, and the box jumps out with rsp and rbp
# both corrupt. The observed crash is a jump into the middle of the mode-3 slab with rbp=0 and rsp still high,
# which is why it never looked like the stack exhaustion an unbounded ARBNO would produce.
#
# ⛔⭐ THIS GATE GRADES OUTPUT AGAINST THE ORACLE, NEVER EXIT STATUS (ceo CEO-564, on hq_S's measurement that a
# crash row had been "cured" into a silent truncation that every rc-based predicate passed). A program here is
# GREEN only when its stdout is byte-identical to spitbol's on the same source, in BOTH modes. An rc-based arm
# could not tell this cure from a silencing, and that is the whole point of the row.
#
# THE CONTROLS ARE LOAD-BEARING: witnesses 2 and 3 are the same shape ONE FENCE apart from witness 1 -- `G0 =
# LEN(0)` takes seal=2 (the memoised-cell arm, no ζ-frame) and the inline `ARBNO(FENCE(LEN(0)))` never builds a
# DEFER at all. Both were green before this cure and must stay green after it: a cure that reached them would be
# a cure that stopped building the frame, not one that stopped popping it twice.
#
# HERMETIC: every program is written to mktemp. It grades no corpus population and publishes no row, so it is
# not a board (ONE RUNNER, ONE BOARD, CEO-523/CEO-547) and every seat can run it.
# EXIT: 0 all arms · 1 an arm failed · 2 REFUSED (no spitbol oracle, no build, no mktemp).
