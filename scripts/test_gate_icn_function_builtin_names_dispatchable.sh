#
# WHAT IT PINS. Icon's function() is a 0-argument generator yielding the names of the built-in functions.
# SCRIP lowers it (src/lower/lower_icon.c, lower_function_gen) as the existing `!["abs", ...]` shape over a
# static table icn_function_names[]. A HAND-TYPED TABLE IS A CLAIM ABOUT A SET, and this file is the thing
# that keeps it true: it grades the table in BOTH directions against the live Icon oracle.
#
# ⛔⭐ WHY THE TABLE IS 83 AND NOT THE ORACLE'S 91. It names what SCRIP ACTUALLY DISPATCHES. The 8 omitted --
# chdir delay display getch getche kbhit loadfunc rename -- raise ERROR 022 in SCRIP today, so yielding them
# would hand every caller a name no call can reach and no proc() can resolve: a stated fact nobody tested,
# which is the defect class this lane keeps finding (a diagnostic naming a cause it never checked). When one
# of the 8 is implemented, ARM 4b REDS until it is added to the table -- that is the point, not a nuisance.
# THE 8 ARE A ROUTE, NOT A HOLE (hq_B ruling 2026-09-06, OCTET): six of them are hq_B's rung-41 entries under
# row icon-rung41-runtime-builtins-chdir-getenv-delay-getch-loadfunc-are-undefined, so when those land this
# gate's ARM 4b is what tells the next reader to grow the table. 83 is a MEASURED CURRENT STATE with a cure
# queued behind it -- never a decision to be different from Icon. hq_B's general form, worth keeping: a
# REFLECTIVE builtin must describe THIS implementation, not the reference one; copying the oracle's 91 would
# be pinning a ref cut from a system we are not.
#
# ⛔ WHERE THIS NOTE LIVES, AND WHY IT IS NOT IN THE .c: hq_B asked for the 8 names in the cure's own comment.
# src/ carries ZERO prose comments by law -- strip_comments.py --check reds any file holding one, and it red
# this cure twice while it was being written -- so the rationale lives here, in the gate that grades the
# table, which is the file a reader of icn_function_names[] is sent to anyway. hq_B is told, not substituted.
#
# ⛔⭐ THE DISPATCHABILITY PROBE, AND WHY IT IS BUILT THIS WAY. ERROR 022 is raised BOTH for an unknown name
# AND for a known builtin called at the wrong arity -- measured: `abs()` with no argument raises 022 exactly
# as `chdir(".")` does. A census that calls every name with a fixed argument count therefore cannot tell
# "unimplemented" from "implemented and refused these arguments", and one that did reported 76 of 91 missing
# against a true answer of 9. So every probe here is built at THE ORACLE'S OWN ARITY, read from the live
# oracle at run time (never a table typed here).
#
# ⛔⭐ AND ARITY ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH -- THIS GATE CAUGHT ITS OWN AUTHOR ASSERTING THAT IT WAS. The claim
# "at the right arity the argument TYPES do not matter" was measured on iand("a","b"), sqrt("zz"), open(1),
# char("q") and tab("x"), all silent, and it is FALSE: the aggregate family (get pop pull push put sort
# sortf) raises 022 for an untyped scalar, and the first run of this gate reported all seven as missing
# builtins when every one of them is present. The sample simply did not contain the discriminating pair --
# the same shape as a cross-type sort witness too narrow to hold the pair that is out of order. So a name
# counts as DISPATCHABLE if EITHER shape is free of 022: all-scalar arguments, or an aggregate first
# argument. Both shapes are still built at oracle arity. Proven to clear all seven and to leave the eight
# genuinely-missing names red.
#
# REFUSES rc=2 rather than reporting green whenever it cannot measure: no oracle, no arity list, zero names
# graded. A test that cannot measure never prints the success shape.
