# LINE AND SKIPS THE CALL WHEN NOTHING IS PENDING (ceo 2026-09-25, CEO-1251). The poll helpers in x86_asm.h wrap their body
# (the bare rt_gc_poll_asm call with its rtccb veneer, or a rooted spill + rt_gc_point_arr_c + reload) in x86_gc_gate: push rax,
# load the flag's address (GOT in mode 4, absolute in mode 3), load the dword, test, pop rax, and a forward je over the body --
# a numeric local label in the text medium, a computed rel8/rel32 over the record string in the binary medium. claws5 spent 8.7%
# of its cycles in the leaf plus its PLT and the veneer's seven memory ops per site. THE TRIGGER IS EQUIVALENT: the allocator
# sets g_gc_pending at the pacing-line crossing under BOTH policies (gc_heap.c: the gc_line_paced() guards are gone and
# g_hp_fr.line is the line always), so the skipped leaf's own line test never saw anything the flag did not -- porter at the
# shipped arena collects 1611 times with and without the gate.
# FOUR ARMS: (1) x86_asm.h's poll helpers all go through x86_gc_gate; (2) a witness's .s carries one pending-flag load per poll
# call of every form (rt_gc_poll_asm, rt_gc_poll, rt_gc_point_arr_c) and one numeric local label per load; (3) THE SLOW PATH IS
# LIVE: the witness at the shipped arena reports collections > 0 on its own [GC-EXERCISE] line in m3 and m4; (4) the witness
# prints its oracle-cut lines in both modes at the shipped arena. EXIT 0 all arms; 1 a red (named); 2 REFUSED.
