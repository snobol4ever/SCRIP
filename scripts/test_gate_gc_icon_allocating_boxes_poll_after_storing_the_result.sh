# test_gate_gc_icon_allocating_boxes_poll_after_storing_the_result.sh -- an Icon allocating box STORES ITS RESULT to
# its mapped frame cell and then POLLS g_gc_pending at the return, so a collection happens in emitted code with no
# runtime C frame live (.github/ARCH-GC-COMPILE-TIME-FRAME-MAPS.md section 7 F6 step 1b, CEO-821; the collector
# guesses nothing, RULES.md FACT RULE, CEO-812).
#
# FAIL-ONCE, MEASURED ON ORIGIN 25282e7a5 (cto, 2026-09-17), the reading the ceo named as this landing's basis:
# `every i := 1 to 4000000 do L := [i, i+1, i+2]` read ONE collection and 861956 KB RSS in mode 3, because
# IR_MAKE_LIST is an emitted box that reaches NO safe point at all -- the shielded rt_gc_point_arr points the frozen
# design keeps are by-name dispatch and string_ops, and an every-do loop over a list constructor enters neither, so
# the pending flag is set inside the first window and nothing takes it until the program ends. With the poll: FIVE
# collections, 161108 KB m3 / 156448 KB m4, answer "done 3" both. The other five Icon allocation shapes measured the
# same sitting (table(), set(), repl(), s1 || s2, s[i:j], a record constructor) are ALREADY bounded through the
# shielded points, which is why this landing is one box and not a sweep: an unmeasured poll is a cost with no reading.
#
# ARMS (all blocking): (0) LIVE -- a value live ONLY in the emitted frame survives the collection the poll takes,
# under SCRIP_GC_STRESS=1 and in an 8 MB window: MEASURED RED BOTH WAYS -- with the poll collecting over the
# conservative entry (cons_stack=1) it SIGSEGVs on poisoned memory, and with gc_zeta_frame left to start at the
# unaligned `char anchor`/`char here` address it SIGSEGVs again, because a sniff that starts 3 bytes off a word
# boundary reads NO stack word correctly (measured: arena-pointing words found from an unaligned start 0, from an
# aligned start 3, 7, 11, 12 on the same four collections). (1) SHAPE, mode 4 -- the emitted .s of the witness shows `call rt_gc_poll` AFTER the two result
# stores that follow `call rt_make_list`, in that order, inside the same box; (2) PLANTED VIOLATION -- the same
# checker run over a copy with the poll deleted must RED, so arm 1 discriminates in both directions; (3) RATE -- the
# churn witness collects more than once and stays under 300 MB with the right answer; (4) BOTH MEDIA AGREE on the
# witness's answer.
