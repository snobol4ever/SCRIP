# test_gate_pas_array_field_elements_keep_their_declared_width.sh -- an ARRAY field of a record keeps its declared element type, not a byte
#
# MEASURED 2026-09-13 by the coo on origin 71b32337f, both modes, while writing the witness for the heap-root row (NOT that
# row, and not caused by it): a record reached through a pointer whose field is an ARRAY OF INTEGER stored every element
# through the char-indexed field path, so p^.ints[i] := i * 300 read back 255 for every i, an array of real read back the
# ordinals of the characters its values had been truncated to, and one element of a six-element array went missing
# entirely. The parser knew a record field was a PACKED ARRAY OF CHAR (fldca) and knew it was a plain char (fldchar), but
# it had no record of a field that is an array of anything ELSE, so every such field fell to the byte path by default.
#
# Cure: the record-type table carries a third field shape, the non-char array (fldna, with its declared low bound); the
# selector marks such a field, an index into it becomes a SUB-ELEMENT index biased by the declared low bound, and both
# ends route through the sub-element storage that was already built in the runtime and had no caller -- __pas_nrec_get to
# read, __pas_nrec_deref_set through a pointer and __pas_nrec_update through a record variable to write. Packed arrays of
# char keep the byte path they had.
#
# ARMS: one program in both modes, byte-identical to fpc -Miso -- an array of integer holding values past 255 read back
# element by element and summed, an array of real read back and summed, a packed array of char printed whole, a nested
# record field, and a second record linked to the first so a field is read through a second pointer hop. FAIL_ONCE=1
# corrupts the first line to prove the diff arm trips.
