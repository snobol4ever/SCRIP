# scripts/test_gate_globals_census_counts_writable_sections_only.sh -- the globals census counts STATE, never a constant:
# a data symbol in .rodata or .data.rel.ro leaves the count, and one in .data, .bss or their TLS twins stays.
#
# THE RULING (ceo CEO-1575, 2026-10-09, row compiler-globals-collect-into-g-parser-g-lower-g-emitter-g-template-structs-
# lons-housekeeping-ceo-1561): "a table never written is not state" -- it is const-qualified to the pointer in its stage's
# landing so the compiler proves it, never exempted by name, and the census reads SECTIONS (.rodata and .data.rel.ro are
# constants, not globals) as test_gate_pl_no_new_global.sh does since 9e50691a0; the bar of 4 then counts mutable state
# only; "the census re-cut lands first, proven once red on a planted mutable and once green".
#
# THE DEFECT IT CLOSES: audit_runtime_globals_census.py took nm classes B D b d, and nm's d/D also cover .data.rel.ro, so a
# table const-qualified to the pointer still counted as a global and the compiler row's bar of 4 would have forced
# constant lookup tables into mutable structs.
#
# THE ARMS, on a fixture library built in a temp root (src/lower/plant.c, compiled -g -fPIC -shared, read through the
# census's --root), never on the tree's own library: (0) the fixture's constants really sit in .rodata and .data.rel.ro by
# objdump -t, or the gate refuses rc=2 (a fixture that never reached those sections proves nothing by passing); (1) GREEN:
# constants only, census --tree compiler --all --max 0 rc 0 and no constant named; (2) RED: the same file plus a planted
# mutable int and a planted table with writable slots (static const char *t[] -- the pointers are state), rc 1 naming
# both plants and no constant.
