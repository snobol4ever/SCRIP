# docstring is the contract; the table is /home/resources/progress/results.tsv, the rule is progress/README.md,
# CEO-319 / CEO-331: every suite run by any session appends its per-program rows in the sitting it rewrites its
# SCORE.md cell). Source this beside lib_gate.sh; every function returns the writer's rc (0 written or
# S4E_PROGRESS_OFF, 2 refused loudly) and NEVER swallows it -- the caller decides whether a run that could not
# record is a landing verdict (it is not).
