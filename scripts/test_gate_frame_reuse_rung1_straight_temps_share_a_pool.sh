# ⭐ RUNG 1 OF frame-slot-reuse-a-live-range-in-a-byrd-graph-extends-to-every-point-reachable-by-recession
# (cto, CEO-684 slice 2): THE CHEAPEST REAL CASE.  A straight box (LIT/VAR/VAR_REF/BINOP/CMP_TEST) whose every reader
# sits on the gamma spine with NO beta-capable box and NO back-edge span between the write and the last read, and
# whose reader's template reads operand slots on alpha only (verified for the straight ops, IR_CALL and
# IR_CALL_PROC_STAGED: bb_call_fn/bb_call/bb_call_proc_staged marshal on alpha, beta falls to omega), takes a slot
# from a per-activation POOL by interval colouring instead of a fresh 16 bytes of its own.
# ⛔ THE CLAIM EACH POOLED SLOT MAKES, PRINTED BESIDE IT BY --dump-zeta (rung 0's relation, now read FROM THE PLAN
# THE GRANTER USED, not recomputed): no recession edge lands between its write and its last read.  A slot that
# cannot state that claim keeps its own storage -- every call result, every generator, every pattern box.
# ⛔ THE FAILURE MODE IS SILENCE, so this gate grades ANSWERS as well as bytes: the three witnesses must print
# their oracle refs in BOTH modes (ok / 11 12 13 / ab) -- a wrong reuse here would be a wrong value, not a crash.
# BYTES: r/1 of the DONE-WHEN witness read 576 on the rung-0 tree; rung 0's relation predicted 448 from
# packed_min=2 over 10 candidates, and the rung-1 tree read 448 -- ON A DUMP THAT WAS NOT THE EMITTED FRAME.
# ⛔ RE-BASED 2026-09-16 (cto, rung 2 opener, second instrument): --dump-zeta ran slot assignment without the
# proc registry, so a staged call to a registered generator callee (every Prolog predicate) was granted no
# callgen.act quad in the dump while the emitter granted one: r/1 emitted 480 while the dump said 448, and
# every number this row reported was 32 low (688/576/448 read 720/608/480 in the frame the code addresses).
# The dump path now shares the compile path's registration and drive (register_procs_all + drive_slots_all,
# emission byte-identical); test_gate_dump_zeta_is_the_emitted_frame.sh holds that claim.  The bar is the TRUE
# rung-1 number, <= 480 (RED-BEFORE of rung 1 on the same honest dump: 576 + 32 = 608 on the rung-0 binary by the same correction, not re-measured; rc=1).
# ⛔ REFUSES rc=2 when --dump-zeta yields no r/1 graph -- a runner that cannot measure never prints the success shape.
