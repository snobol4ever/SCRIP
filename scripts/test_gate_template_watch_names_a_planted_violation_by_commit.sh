# test_gate_template_watch_names_a_planted_violation_by_commit.sh — the template watch names the commit, the class
# and the seat of a violation a landing adds (hq_templates, row
# templates-the-watch-loop-a-census-diff-names-every-template-violation-a-landing-adds-by-file-commit-and-seat,
# ceo CEO-1321; Lon 2026-09-27: "it will just run in a loop always looking for seats creating bad code so it can
# scoop it up and fix it").
#
# THE FIXTURE. A shared, no-checkout clone of this tree in a scratch directory (the real tree, its index and its
# refs are never touched), and four commits planted on its HEAD with plumbing, each changing ONE template:
#   C1  a neutral touch of a DIRTY template F2 (a trailing space on line 1: no class moves)
#   C2  a blank line appended to a CLEAN template F1 (blank_lines +1: clean -> dirty), its message naming a row
#       whose bus claim, in a scratch postoffice, is held by hq_templates, and naming the ceo as relay
#   C3  a line PORT_ALPHA appended to F2 (port_english +1: a dirty file's count rises), naming hq_templates
#   C4  a neutral touch of F1 after C2
# F1 and F2 are chosen by the audit itself at HEAD (the first clean and the first dirty template by path), so
# the fixture follows the set as it is cured and never pins a file name.
# THE ARMS. BASE..C4: rc 1, both files named with their class, C2 and C3 named RAISED with that class and their
# seat (C2 by the bus claim, over the ceo its message also names), C1 and C4 named touched and never RAISED, the
# verdict counting two files and two arrived violations, the population read at both ends. BASE..C1: rc 0 and
# nothing RAISED (the watch can say no). An unreadable base and a base that is not an ancestor: rc 2.
# ⛔ FAIL-ONCE: TEMPLATE_WATCH=<path> points the gate at another watch; the landing's proof ran it on a mutant
# that credits the first commit touching a file instead of the one that raised it, and the gate read RED.
