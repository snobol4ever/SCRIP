# test_gate_gprolog_output_filter_is_the_one_filter.sh -- ONE FILTER OVER gprolog's STANDARD OUTPUT, AND IT READS BOTH BANNERS (the coo
# 2026-10-10, ceo CEO-1599 on the oracle swap CEO-1598: Lon, in-chat to the ceo, verbatim: "Get the new oracle 1.6.0 and begin using it
# instead of the older one."). MEASURED: gprolog 1.6.0 prints its banner as three lines and then one EMPTY line, where 1.4.5 printed four
# lines and a compiling line; the five copies of the 1.4.5 filter (the GNU runner twice, lib_prolog_bench.sh's gnu_filter,
# test_bench_prolog_4way.sh, test_bench_prolog_modes.sh) kept that empty line, and every one of the 48 GNU driver outputs differed from its
# ref by it alone. They now call gprolog_output_filter (lib_oracle_flags.sh).
#   ARM 1  the fixed 1.6.0 witness through the filter is exactly the program's lines -- the banner and its empty line gone, an empty line
#          the program printed kept, the query echo and an "In file included from" preamble gone, a file:line warning kept
#   ARM 2  the same witness with --compile-diagnostics also drops the file:line warning and "compilation failed"
#   ARM 3  the fixed 1.4.5 witness through the filter is exactly the program's lines (both banners are read)
#   ARM 4  FAIL-ONCE, held as a negative control: the 1.4.5-keyed pattern the five copies carried, over the 1.6.0 witness, keeps the
#          banner's empty line -- so arm 1 can see the defect it guards
#   ARM 5  CENSUS: no script under scripts/ but lib_oracle_flags.sh and this gate carries its own anchored copy of the banner pattern
#   ARM 6  LIVE: gprolog_bin (the oracle) consulting a two-line program prints, through the filter, exactly those two lines
# EXIT: 0 every arm holds · 1 an arm is red · 2 could not measure (the library or the oracle missing).
