#
# WHAT WAS THERE. c60097828 put a BARE POLL (x86_rt_gc_poll) after the shared DESCR store at four templates.
# At bb_binop_concat_slot.cpp:69 that poll made a SILENT WRONG ANSWER: pattern captures assigned through the
# concat-slot road came back as runs of 0xDB -- the byte gc_heap.c memsets over VACATED ground after compaction --
# so the block was RECLAIMED, not moved-and-missed, and the DESCR length word survived while the payload did not.
# No ZGC-STALE fires even under SCRIP_GC_RELOC=1, because the read lands on poisoned-but-MAPPED ground rather than
# quarantined ground. rc=0 throughout: a wrong answer with no diagnostic.
#
# WHY THE LINE CAME OUT RATHER THAN CHANGING FORM. The site takes NO poll form at all: measured one bit per suspect,
# a rebuild between each -- poll_res DIFFs, poll_res plus a re-store into ZRES(0)/ZRES(8) DIFFs, and the poll moved
# after rtcc_rl DIFFs. A site that refuses every poll form is a DIAGNOSTIC SIGNAL, not a stubborn site: it says the
# value there is held by something the collector never visits (CEO-1131). The holder hunt is its own row; this gate
# only holds the ground that the revert won back, so the poll cannot return without a red.
#
# ARMS. (1) BAND: the witness matches its oracle-cut ref at stress 0, 1, 3 and 5 at the mandatory tiny arena,
# and every arm prints the run's OWN collections count -- a tiny arena states a configuration, only a count states
# an exercise (CEO-934). (2) EXERCISE: at least one stress point must report collections>0, so the band cannot go
# green by never collecting. (3) POSITIVE: the emitted code for the witness must still contain the concat-slot
# runtime call, so a green cannot be bought by deleting the road or by a witness that stopped reaching it --
# an absence criterion is paired with a positive arm proving the emitter still exists.
