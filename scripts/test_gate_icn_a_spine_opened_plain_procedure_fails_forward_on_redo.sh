# test_gate_icn_a_spine_opened_plain_procedure_fails_forward_on_redo.sh -- A CALL THROUGH A PROCEDURE VALUE THAT THE SPINE OPENED AND THAT CANNOT SUSPEND
# MUST FAIL FORWARD WHEN THE CALLER BACKTRACKS INTO IT, IN BOTH MODES, AT EVERY ARENA AND STRESS LEVEL.
# ⛔ THE MEASURED DEFECT THIS PINS (ceo 2026-09-19, row gc-the-five-c-to-bb-entries-outside-rt-c-go-to-zero, CEO-929's design behind the open/land pair):
# rt_call_value_spine_prep used to refuse every callee that was not a generator, which sent 26 of the 40 procedure-value calls reaching
# by_name_dispatch.c 1129 over the Icon master down rt_call_value_gen_h -- a C frame entering a Byrd box, which is the thing Lon's 13:5x order
# ('ZERO instances of C code calling into a BB') removes. The refusal was not a policy: it was the box's ONLY guard. bb_call_value's beta
# reads callgen.act +0 and resumes on 1, and a plain procedure returns its one result and RELEASES its frame, so opening one on the spine with
# nothing else changed makes every redo jump back into a dead frame. Measured that day on this very witness with the refusal removed and no
# act0 word: `every x := f()` and a failing comparison each looped forever -- 4 of 4 runs timed out at 10 s, both modes, both arenas, while a
# single non-backtracking call was byte-correct. The cure is CVSPINE_t (descr.h): prep hands the box act0 = 2 for a non-resumable callee and the
# box fails forward on it instead of resuming. THIS GATE IS THE FAIL-ONCE ARM MADE PERMANENT -- drop the 2 and it hangs, which is why it runs
# under `timeout` and reads a timeout as RED rather than letting a board hang.
# The ref is cut from the ORACLE (/home/resources/icon-master/bin/icon), not from our own output, so it does not rot on our own improvements.
