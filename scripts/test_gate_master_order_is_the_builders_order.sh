# test_gate_master_order_is_the_builders_order.sh -- THE COMMITTED MASTER IS SORTED THE WAY ITS BUILDER SORTS.
# Row promotion-re-sorts-the-master-so-rank-stays-the-greenest-prefix (ceo ruling 2026-09-03, on hq_B's
# routed question; FINDING-2026-09-03-hq_B-a-promotion-changes-an-entrys-sort-key-*).
#
# THE LAW IT GUARDS is Lon's, not the builder's: "a smoke test would be say the first 20-50 tests... then
# another level at 100-200... the last level all 1200+". A LEVEL IS A PREFIX, so `rank <= N` must select the
# GREENEST N -- green before xfail, then fewer features, then shorter, then name.
# ⛔ WHAT BREAKS IT IS NOT AN EDIT TO THE ORDER, IT IS A PROMOTION. Flipping an entry's xfail changes its SORT
# KEY, so a promotion that only rewrites the three marker locations leaves the file sorted under the old key.
# Measured 2026-09-03 after the seven prolog promotions of corpus 2b71e9a2: 265 of 404 entries out of order,
# with nothing inconsistent -- ALL.pl and ALL.csv agreed with each other, every marker gate was green, and the
# only thing wrong was that the law had quietly stopped being true.
# ⭐ THE KEY IS IMPORTED FROM THE BUILDER (master_file_key), NEVER RE-TYPED HERE. A guard carrying its own copy
# of the rule drifts from the thing it guards and then both are wrong together.
# ⛔ master_file_key, NOT master_sort_key (measured 2026-09-05): write_suite() always emits every kind="line"
# entry before every other kind (a format-(B) block ends only at the next banner or EOF, so a trailing
# one-liner would be silently swallowed into it), so plain master_sort_key describes an order SNOBOL4's mixed
# format-A/format-B master cannot physically store. master_file_key partitions by kind first, then applies
# master_sort_key within each kind -- byte-identical to master_sort_key for every other (single-kind) master.
# LANGS= overrides the masters checked (default: every corpus/tests/<lang>/ carrying an ALL.csv).
