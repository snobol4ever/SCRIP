# test_gate_icn_monitor_icx_links_what_scrip_links.sh -- THE ICON ORACLE PARTICIPANT CAN BRACKET A PROGRAM THAT LINKS A LIBRARY
# SHIPPED BESIDE IT (hq_icon 2026-09-25, ceo CEO-1272 (b)).
#
# icont links ucode, never source. test_monitor_3way_sync_step_auto.sh compiled the icx participant with `icont -s` alone, so a
# program whose `link` names a library beside it -- every CEO-1269 NAME_driver, io_lib, lists_lib -- died in the icx compile with
# "cannot resolve reference to file 'NAME.u1'" and monitor_run.sh --oracle REFUSED: no bracket was possible on a linked program.
# The harness now finds every library the program reaches in SCRIP's own search order (icon_driver.c icn_link_open: IPATH,
# ICONPATH, the IPL procs beside the scrip binary, the linking file's directory), translates it into its scratch directory, and
# icont links from there, so both participants run the same library source.
#
# THE WITNESS: a scratch main that links a scratch library, which links a second one -- a two-deep closure, one statement per
# line so the bracket grades linking and nothing else -- must read AGREE under monitor_run.sh --oracle. On the harness before
# this change the same pair REFUSES (the icx compile), which is this gate's red.
