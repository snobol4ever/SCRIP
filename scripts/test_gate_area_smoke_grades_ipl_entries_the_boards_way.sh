# test_gate_area_smoke_grades_ipl_entries_the_boards_way.sh -- THE AREA SMOKE GRADES AN IPL ENTRY THE WAY THE IPL BOARD DOES (the coo
# 2026-10-02, row instruments-the-area-smoke-grades-ipl-entries-without-their-sidecars-and-reads-nine-false-reds, minted by the ceo).
# MEASURED CAUSE: the cfo's area smoke on 328bf9c9a read nine packages/icon/ipl entries NEW RED (webimage based cwd declchck farb
# hebcalen parens puzz xtable) against the board's PASS readings. The smoke graded the generated ALL.icn/ALL.ref container, which no
# runner maintains and which carries none of the per-program sidecars the board grades under (NAME.pin, the clock-and-entropy shim;
# NAME.dat stdin; NAME.argv; NAME.outfiles; fixtures; the isolation directory). Run the board's way by hand, farb parens puzz xtable
# read PASS. THE CURE: the smoke delegates the ipl table to test_icon_ipl_suite.sh's smoke mode (S4E_AREA_SMOKE_ENTRIES), which grades
# the named entries through the board's own loop and writes no progress row and no score row; the one-runner guard admits that mode.
# WHAT THIS GATE HOLDS, over the shared corpus read-only (a smoke is not a board, CEO-1342), witnesses progs/puzz progs/farb
# progs/parens progs/xtable, modes m3 m4:
# (1) the smoke says it delegated, and every witness reads m3=PASS m4=PASS;
# (2) the smoke wrote no score row: SUITES.tsv and SCORE.md byte-identical before and after;
# (3) FAIL-ONCE, the pre-cure smoke (the harness with SMOKE_DELEGATES emptied, grading the container) reads at least one witness red --
#     puzz seeds &random from &clock, which only the board's .pin shim fixes -- so arm 1 reds on the defect this gate names.
# rc 2 when the binary, the runner or a witness is missing, or the smoke refuses.
