# test_gate_sm_dead.sh — PHASE 0 (SM EXCISION) death ratchet.
#
# Counts LIVE references to the Stack-Machine EXECUTION surface — the global
# machinery being demolished: the SM interpreter (sm_interp_run), the native SM
# emitter (sm_run_native), and the SM value stack (g_vstack). Comments and
# extern forward-decls are excluded; the count is the live call/def/access sites.
#
# This gate does NOT match per-box backtrack arenas (e.g. `_1[64]`, enter()/calloc
# frames, ARBNO_i). Those are box-local data on the SURVIVOR side of the line and
# are intentionally invisible here — a future session must not "fix" them.
#
# It also does NOT match the SM_sequence_t *container* type. That struct currently
# carries the Icon BB table (bb_table/bb_count/bb_cap) which the survivor needs;
# the container is slimmed (SM fields removed), not deleted, in SMX-5.
#
# Ratchet: baseline 13. Lower as each language crosses off the SM and the
# interpreter/native/value-stack surface loses callers. Reaches 0 at SM-FINAL-DELETE.
