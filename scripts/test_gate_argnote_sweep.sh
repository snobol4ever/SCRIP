# the three annotation invariants the ladder names: (1) ZERO stray '#@' markers survive into a .s -- an unfolded
# marker means the fold missed a chunk boundary; (2) ZERO notes on jump lines -- the GOTO column belongs to the
# jumps, Lon's explicit directive; (3) emit failures held at the pre-existing baseline, so an annotation pass is
# never the thing that broke a program.  Reports the annotation volume so a regression to zero is visible too.

# ⚠️⭐ THE RATIONALE BELOW IS RETRACTED LAW, AND THIS PRUNE IS BOTH UNNECESSARY AND ALREADY INERT.  READ THIS FIRST.
# ⭐ WHAT LON ACTUALLY RULED, 2026-08-27, in-chat to CEO, verbatim in substance: "Do not use the lon_cherryholmes folder as runtime tests.  Use them for parser tests
# all day long.  And in fact, all the corpus/programs need work and cannot be converted to tests currently."  Mechanically: PARSER TESTS unrestricted; RUNTIME AND
# SCORED BOARDS no; the whole corpus/programs/ tree (EBNF, lon_cherryholmes, TZ) is not convertible to tests currently.  Reading, compiling, running BY HAND, citing
# and measuring all stay free -- the restriction is solely about installing these programs AS TESTS.  Authority: RULES.md ABSOLUTE RULES, the lon_cherryholmes block.
# ⭐ THIS GATE IS COMPILE-ONLY -- it runs `$SCRIP --compile` and never executes a program -- so it is a PARSER test, and Lon's ruling makes parser use of
# lon_cherryholmes UNRESTRICTED ("use them for parser tests all day long").  Nothing here needs to exclude that tree.
# ⚠️ AND THE PRUNE IS ALREADY INERT: it reads `-path '*/programs/lon' -prune`, which stopped matching when the s272 re-grid renamed the directory to
# lon_cherryholmes/, so the 99 files ALREADY flow through this sweep.  The status quo therefore already matches the ruling; removing the dead prune is a
# BEHAVIOURAL edit and this commit is comment-only by grant (hq_C, ceo), so it is left for an attributed commit of its own.
# ⛔⭐ THE TRAP WORTH CARRYING AWAY: the assertion below was written to RE-CHECK the prune -- but it greps for the SAME stale name the prune uses, so both died
# together and the check reported 0 and read as proof of exclusion while proving nothing.  A GUARD AND ITS OWN CANARY MUST NOT SHARE A FAILURE MODE.
# ⛔ HISTORICAL, SUPERSEDED, KEPT FOR THE RECORD ONLY: THE OFF-LIMITS TREE IS PRUNED BY CONSTRUCTION, NOT SKIPPED IN THE LOOP (RULES.md ABSOLUTE RULE 1; row `scorecard-drop-lon`, s189).  This gate roots at the CORPUS ROOT and
# runs `$SCRIP --compile` on every .sno it finds, so until s189 it COMPILED all 99 programs under corpus/lon on every run -- against a rule whose words are "NEVER RUN,
# NEVER COMPILE ... in any mode, under any harness", and whose second reason is that those files may carry live Personal Access Tokens.  The `-prune` is what the rule asks for
# ("must EXCLUDE this directory by construction rather than by skipping it at run time"); the assertion under it is because a prune is one edit away from being lost and this
# gate's own CORPUS is env-overridable, so the exclusion is RE-CHECKED against the built list rather than trusted.  The assert prints no path from that tree -- only a count.
