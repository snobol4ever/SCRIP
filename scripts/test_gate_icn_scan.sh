# scripts/test_gate_icn_scan.sh — ICN-SCAN-FENCE gate (GOAL-ICON-BB.md, ICN-SCAN ladder close-out).
# Four sections per the FENCE spec:
#   (a) all nine IR_SCAN_* kinds OFF icn_kind_native_stub (and present in src/contracts);
#   (b) the ladder probe sweep — every ICN-SCAN-0..13a probe, three modes, policy per documented flags:
#         STRICT  m2==m3==m4==expected AND no [SMX] (an refuse must not masquerade as a fail-probe pass)
#         M34     m3==m4==expected, m2 recorded informationally (the SCAN-3 pre-existing oracle pos gap)
#         PIN     m2==m3==m4==ONE-SHOT expected (ORACLE SCAN-FN GENERATIVITY flag: goal probes specify
#                 multi-result; the m2 oracle is one-shot for every scan builtin; native matches the oracle
#                 bit-for-bit and is pump-ready. Making m2 generative SHIFTS THE 129 BASELINE — Lon's call.
#                 Until that re-baseline rung, this gate pins three-mode AGREEMENT on the one-shot value.)
#         X34     m2==expected AND m3 AND m4 each print [SMX] with rc=0 (LOUD REFUSE — the =s var-operand
#                 shape, the wave-1 dynamic-arg refuses; SCAN-13b deferral PROMOTED to STRICT at ICN-VAR-3)
#   (c) the corpus scan bucket — every corpus .icn whose --dump-bb graph carries IR_GEN_SCAN, all three
#       modes vs .expected, with ratchet floors (REFUSED->PASS deltas land here as future boxes light up);
#   (d) standing structural gates: no_bb_bin_t . no_handencoded --strict . icn_no_stack .
#       icn_one_reg_frame (HARD); no_vstack informational; medium-invisible scoped to the
#       scan-family templates (the global --strict RED is the documented Prolog-lane bb_* WIP).
# Exit 0 iff (a) + (b) + (c floors) + (d) all hold.

#
# ⛔ SIX PROBES AND THE CORPUS BUCKET WERE MEASURING A DEAD ERA (s247, seat1, rung N-0).  This gate had
# been RED at every pristine HEAD since s241, which recorded the fact honestly and moved on — and every
# reason for the red turned out to be instrument rot, not compiler defect:
#   (i)  THE BUCKET SELECTOR NAMED A RETIRED OPCODE.  It admitted a program when `--dump-bb` output carried
#        `GEN_SCAN`.  `IR_GEN_SCAN` NO LONGER EXISTS IN `src/contracts/` AT ALL (it survives only as a stale
#        row in `src/tools/emit_per_kind_audit.c`); the live scan boxes dump as `"kind":"SCAN"`,
#        `"SCAN_ENTER"`, `"SCAN_TAB"`, `"SCAN_UPTO"`, `"SCAN_MATCH"`, `"SCAN_MOVE"`, `"SCAN_FIND"`.
#        So N=0 for the whole corpus and the m2/m3/m4 floors (31/11/11) were UNREACHABLE BY CONSTRUCTION.
#        A gate that cannot go green no matter how good the compiler gets teaches seats to ignore it — the
#        fail-closed twin of the vacuous-green rot found the same session in icn_no_stack/icn_one_reg_frame.
#        The selector now accepts BOTH spellings.
#   (ii) FOUR PROBES PINNED DEFECTS THE COMPILER HAS SINCE FIXED.  `upto_oneshot` pinned "3" for
#        `"hello" ? every write(upto('l'))` and `find_oneshot` pinned "2" for `"banana" ? every write(find("an"))`
#        — the ONE-SHOT answers, flagged in-gate as the "ORACLE GENERATIVITY" marker.  Canonically both are
#        {*} GENERATORS (`refs/icon-master/src/runtime/fstranl.r:237 function{*} upto`), and SCRIP now emits
#        the correct `3 4` / `2 4`.  The pins were promoted to the true expectations under STRICT.
#        `any_dynamic_arg` and `eq_match_var` carried policy X34 = "m3/m4 must LOUDLY REFUSE": both are now
#        implemented natively and produce the oracle answer in all three modes with no refusal.  X34 exists
#        so an unsupported construct fails loud instead of answering wrongly; an implementation that answers
#        CORRECTLY satisfies that safety property strictly better, so those probes were promoted to STRICT —
#        the strongest policy in the table, not a relaxation.
#   (iii) THE BUCKET COUNTED XFAIL PROGRAMS AS FAILURES.  `test_icon_all_rungs.sh` skips a program with a
#        matching `.xfail` marker (30 exist) and reports XFAIL separately; this bucket had no such skip, so
#        every known-unimplemented program arrived in the "unexpected FAIL" count and the HARD rule ("m3/m4
#        must have ZERO unexpected FAILs") could never hold.  The skip is now the SAME test the suite runner
#        uses — one law, two readers — so an unexpected FAIL is once again unexpected.
#   (iv) THE BUCKET GRADED WITH A DIFFERENT INPUT CONTRACT THAN THE SUITE.  `test_icon_all_rungs.sh` feeds a
#        program its `.stdin` file when one exists and runs it with cwd = the corpus directory so relative
#        data-file reads resolve; this gate fed /dev/null from the SCRIP root, so every program that reads
#        input or opens a data file failed HERE and passed THERE.  That is the whole reason its "unexpected
#        FAIL" count read 28 against a suite watermark of 16.  run3 now applies both laws.
#   (v)  `m2` IS A FOSSIL: modes 1 and 2 were DELETED, and both the A2 and A3 columns invoke the SAME
#        `--run` command.  The column is retained because the floors are keyed to it — and it does earn a
#        keep, as a same-binary repeat that would expose a nondeterministic program — but it is NOT an
#        independent mode and must never be read as one.
#   (vi) A PROGRAM WITH NO `.expected` CANNOT BE GRADED, AND THE BUCKET GRADED IT ANYWAY — comparing its
#        output against the empty string and counting the mismatch as a failure.  Two corpus programs carry
#        no oracle (`rung37_every_do_hello` is the one that reaches these buckets); the suite's denominator
#        is 293, not 295, for exactly this reason.  Skipped now, as the suite does.
# ⛔ THE FLOORS BELOW ARE FROM THE ERA WHEN THE BUCKET LAST WORKED and have not been re-derived; if they now
# fail against a live bucket, that is a measurement to report, not a number to edit into a pass.

# ⛔ FLOORS RE-DERIVED s247 (seat1, N-0) — 31/11/11 -> 26/26/24, AND THE ARITHMETIC IS THE JUSTIFICATION.
# The old floors were calibrated against a bucket that walked `find $CORPUS -name '*.icn'` RECURSIVELY —
# 1,348 files across jcon-ref/, jcon-compiler/, ipl/, parser/, repro/, of which 1,048 CARRY NO `.expected`.
# Those were graded against the EMPTY STRING, so a library file that prints nothing scored a PASS.  Of the
# 53 programs the GEN_SCAN filter admitted, 22 had no oracle: skipping them removed 18 PASSES and 4 FAILS
# (18+4 = 22, exactly).  ⭐ THE HONEST PASS COUNT DID NOT MOVE — 44 - 18 = 26 — so NO REAL PROGRAM
# REGRESSED, which is the check that distinguishes re-deriving a floor from lowering a bar to buy a green.
# m3 11 -> 26 and m4 11 -> 24 are large TIGHTENINGS; m2 31 -> 26 is a smaller number against an honest
