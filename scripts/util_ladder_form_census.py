"""util_ladder_form_census.py -- DECLARED FORMS minus BUILT ORIGINS, per language, per rung.

WHY THIS EXISTS (hq_T 2026-09-13, on hq_I's report from inside lib_ladder.sh):
  lib_ladder.sh carries the law that A RUNG DECLARED IN LADDER.tsv AND NOT BUILT IS RED, NOT ABSENT,
  and enforces it AT RUNG GRANULARITY ONLY -- a rung with at least one witness satisfies the check.
  Nothing compares the FORMS column against the origins that actually exist, so snocone rung23
  (six forms declared, four built) grades 8/8 and prints the success shape over two gaps. That is the
  runner's own missing-denominator defect one level down, with FORMS substituted for RUNG.

  hq_I asked the right question before proposing a gate: HOW MANY declared-but-unbuilt forms are there
  across the seven? Turning a refusal on without knowing that is not a gate, it is an outage. This tool
  is the census that answers it, and it is deliberately a REPORT, not a gate -- see THE RULING below.

⛔⭐ THE FIRST CENSUS OF THIS WAS WRONG AND THE REASON IS THE REUSABLE PART. Counting the
  WITNESS_ORIGIN column and diffing it against FORMS reported 218 unbuilt forms for icon and 249 for
  snobol4 -- both false, and false in the direction that manufactures a crisis. THE COLUMN CARRIES
  THREE DIFFERENT CONVENTIONS, and only one of them is machine-readable:
    NAMES  snocone, prolog, raku, pascal -- '|'-separated literal origins, 1:1 with FORMS
    GLOB   icon                          -- a human summary, e.g. 'ladder__rung01_paper_* (8)'
    DASH   rebus, snobol4                -- '-', unpopulated; forms map to origins BY NAME only
  A census keyed on that column answers "is this column populated in the style I assumed", never
  "is the form built". So this tool derives BUILT from ALL.csv -- the master is the only authority on
  what exists -- and matches each declared form by name against the rung's own origins. The column is
  then reported as METADATA (which convention it uses), never as evidence.
