# test_gate_icn_ipl_cutter_detects_a_nondeterministic_program.sh -- proves util_cut_icon_ipl_refs.sh's flake
# detector ACTUALLY DETECTS. Instrument side of row icon-ipl-qei-nested-icont-nondeterminism-neither-cutter-
# detects (ceo mint CEO-516 -> hq_R): "the cutter's flake detector (an N-rep arm) fails once against a planted
# nondeterministic program."
#
# ⛔⭐ WHY THIS GATE EXISTS AT ALL. The cutter already HAD a determinism arm -- four sub-second runs plus a
# minute-crossing second pass -- and nothing anywhere proved it could fail. An undetected-flake mints a .std
# from one arbitrary run, and a ref pinned off a flaky run is the worst artifact this project produces: a
# plausible-looking pin that grades every future run against a lie, indistinguishable downstream from a good
# one. That is the same class the sibling gate test_gate_ref_cutters_refuse_a_dead_oracle.sh was built for,
# and this file deliberately follows its shape. ⭐ The cutter's own header already records the reject-
# everything trap in its own words: "its validation against four known-bad programs PASSED, because a
# reject-everything bug rejects the known-bad too." ARM 3 below is the control that makes ARMS 1 and 2 mean
# something -- agreement counts only when the arms CAN disagree (RULES.md THE INSTRUMENT LAWS).
#
# ⛔⛔ THE DETECTOR IS TWO MECHANISMS, NOT ONE, AND A GATE THAT EXERCISED ONLY ONE WOULD READ GREEN WITH THE
# OTHER DELETED. They are independent and are planted against separately:
#   (a) the RUN arm    -- four sub-second runs must agree, then a minute-crossing re-run must agree again.
#                         Planted by flaky_run.icn, which reads 8 bytes from /dev/urandom. ⛔ It must NOT
#                         read the clock, or mechanism (b) would classify it before (a) ever ran and the arm
#                         would pass while proving nothing about the thing it names.
#   (b) the SOURCE arm -- greps the source for &dateline/&date/&clock/&now/&time and refuses WITHOUT running,
#                         because a date-valued output is byte-stable across every window anyone watches and
#                         goes red at midnight (the cutter's own gftrace.std witness). Planted by
#                         flaky_date.icn, which is otherwise perfectly well-behaved.
# ⛔⭐ THE SOURCE-ARM WITNESS MUST USE &date, NOT &clock, AND THE FIRST DRAFT OF THIS GATE USED &clock AND
# PASSED FOR THE WRONG REASON. &clock has SECOND granularity, so whether the cutter's four sub-second runs
# straddle a second boundary is luck: the draft's witness was caught by the RUN arm ("disagreed on
# confirmation run 1/3"), mechanism (b) was never reached, and ARM 2 would have reported the source arm
# working on a tree where it was deleted -- while ALSO being intermittent, since on a different second it
# would have fallen through. &date has DAY granularity, so it is byte-stable across four sub-second runs AND
# across a minute boundary, and ONLY the source arm can refuse it. ⭐ The general form is the one this
# package keeps re-learning: an arm that can be satisfied by a mechanism other than the one it names is not
# a test of that mechanism. ARM 2 therefore asserts the REASON, not just the verdict.
#
# ⛔⭐ EVERY ARM HERE ASSERTS THE REASON, NOT ONLY THE VERDICT, AND BOTH OF THE FIRST TWO DRAFTS NEEDED IT.
# The detector is REDUNDANT for a per-run flake -- the four-run arm and the minute-crossing second pass both
# catch it -- which is good news about the cutter and fatal to a naive arm. MEASURED, by re-running this gate
# against a copy of the cutter with the four-run comparison replaced by `if false`: the gate still read 6/6,
# because flaky_run fell through to the minute pass and was refused there. So ARM 1 now requires the reason to
# name a "confirmation run" and ARM 2 requires it to name the clock marker; each arm can now only be satisfied
# by the mechanism it is planted against. ⭐ Two arms, two drafts, one lesson, and it is the lesson this whole
# gate exists to enforce one level down: AN INSTRUMENT THAT CANNOT FAIL FOR THE REASON IT NAMES IS NOT MEASURING
# THAT REASON. Re-prove falsifiability the same way before trusting any edit to this file -- neuter one
# mechanism in a COPY of the cutter and confirm the matching arm, and only that arm, goes red.
#
# ISOLATION: the cutter derives its package from S4E_HOME, so this gate points S4E_HOME at a scratch tree and
# the REAL corpus is never read, walked, or written. Nothing here can mint into the tracked package.
# FALSIFIABILITY, MEASURED not asserted (2026-09-10, hq_R), each against a COPY of the cutter with ONE
# mechanism removed: four-run comparison -> `if false` reds ARM 1 ALONE, 5/6, and its message names the
# minute-crossing backstop that caught the flake instead; the clock grep -> a never-matching pattern reds
# ARM 2 **and** ARM 4, 4/6, because flaky_date is then LIVE and MINTED -- a date-valued ref pinned as ground
# truth, which is the gftrace.std incident reproduced on demand. The real cutter reads 6/6.
# ARMS: 1 the run-arm flake is classified NONDETERMINISTIC · 2 the source-arm flake is classified
# NONDETERMINISTIC and names its marker · 3 CONTROL: the well-behaved program is still classified LIVE and
# minted (so the arms can disagree) · 4 neither flake left a .std behind under --apply · 5 the control's
# minted .std holds the program's exact bytes · 6 the printed denominator covers the whole planted population.
# EXIT: 0 all arms · 1 an arm failed · 2 REFUSED (could not measure: no oracle, cutter missing, mktemp failed).
# RUNTIME ~70s, dominated by the cutter's own minute-crossing sleep -- one sleep for the whole population, so
# all three witnesses go through a SINGLE cutter invocation rather than one run each.
