# test_gate_master_boards_publish_xpass.sh -- ROW-LEVEL GATE (hq_T, on coo's ruling 2026-09-08).
# ⛔⭐ THE DEFECT THIS ASSERTS AGAINST IS A BOARD DEFECT, NOT AN INSTRUMENT ONE.  A master headline that holds its
# fraction constant while xfail and xpass TRADE underneath it is STRUCTURALLY BLIND TO MOVEMENT INSIDE ITS OWN
# KNOWN-RED SET: a seat can cure a real bug and the row cannot show it, and a marker can go stale and the row
# cannot show that either.  Both are invisible for the same reason and in OPPOSITE directions, so no amount of
# reading the fraction tells them apart -- which is why the cure is to publish the xpass count beside it.
# ⭐ WHAT IT BUYS, and the reason it is worth a gate: it converts the question "are this master's declared xfails
# still red?" from a RUN into a READ.  A nonzero xpass IS the stale-marker case, printed.  Before this, settling it
# cost a full board, and two boards taken an hour apart genuinely disagreed (snobol4 read xfail 26 xpass 1, then
# xfail 25 xpass 2), so the run everyone would have had to spend was not even reproducible.
# ⛔ IT ASSERTS THE PROPERTY, NEVER THE NUMBERS.  Any xpass count greens it, zero included -- a zero is a MEASURED
# "no stale markers", which is exactly the reading the row could not previously carry.  What reds it is a cell that
# publishes a fraction and says nothing about the set behind it.
