# test_gate_sno_eval_chains_nothing_references_are_reclaimed_and_a_full_code_pool_is_loud.sh -- EVAL's compiled chains: reclaimed when nothing
# can reference them, and a full code pool is error 204, never a quiet FAIL (hq_icon 2026-10-03, ceo row
# snobol4-after-about-523000-distinct-evals-every-later-eval-fails-in-one-scrip-process).
#
# MEASURED 2026-10-03 on f7e45d9de: inf_eval.sno over 600,000 DISTINCT lines `'y-z' ? BAL | LEN(i % 3) | 'q<i>'` answers as sbl for 523,251 lines and
# FAIL for every line after. Cause: bb_pool.c is a fixed 2 GB mmap handing out whole pages; since 5dfcab7c5 eval_string_transient RETAINS every
# distinct chain (releasing one that returned a PATTERN was a use-after-free: the pattern's deferred elements live in the chain), one page each:
# 524,288 pages less the program's own ~1,037 is 523,251. bb_alloc then returned NULL, eval_build_chain returned NULL, and the caller read that as
# "no syntax error found" and answered FAIL. Cure (runtime_eval.c, bb_pool.c, gc_heap.c, core.c): (1) a chain is released after its run when it
# provably cannot be referenced -- it created no pattern or expression thunk, its result is a plain value (string, number, array, table, name,
# keyword, data, fail), and nothing was added to the pool above it while it ran -- and only on the first sighting of its text (a second sighting
# is cached as before, so a hot expression compiles twice and runs from the cache); (2) bb_pool_release drops the GC frame maps registered inside
# the pages it frees, a dormant dangling-map hazard of the old release path; (3) a pool with less than 4 MB free (the smallest chain reservation)
# raises error 204 naming the pool instead of FAIL, from EVAL, CONVERT, CODE and runtime pattern builds. SCRIP_CODE_POOL_MB (8..2048) lowers
# the pool so this gate fills it in seconds. Arms, each byte-identical to sbl -bf in both modes except arm C: A 6000 distinct scalar EVALs in a
# 16 MB pool; B pattern- and expression-valued EVALs built, then 3000 distinct scalar EVALs recycle the pool, then the patterns are used; C 20000
# distinct pattern EVALs overflow the same pool: rc != 0, stderr names error 204 and the pool, stdout carries no `FAIL at`. FAIL_ONCE=1 corrupts
# arm A's expected line to prove the diff arm trips.
