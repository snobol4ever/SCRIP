"""THE SAFE-POINT CONTRACT CHECKER -- the emitted bytes at every safe point, read against what ARCH-GC section 3 DECLARES.

FROM HAWBLITZEL AND PETRANK, AUTOMATED VERIFICATION OF PRACTICAL GARBAGE COLLECTORS, POPL 2009 (in
/home/resources/gc-papers).  Their method transfers to us for one specific reason: THEY VERIFIED AT THE ASSEMBLY
LEVEL, and we emit assembly.  We are not mechanizing a proof.  What transfers TODAY is the shape of the thing --
the collector's contract with the mutator is written down, and the EMITTED BYTES are checked against it rather
than trusted to match it.

WHAT SECTION 3 DECLARES, quoted, and the four clauses this file grades it into:

    "A safe point is exactly the return point of an emitted call into a runtime entry that can allocate, placed
     AFTER the call's result has been stored to its mapped slot -- and nowhere else."
    "Storing the result before the poll means the fresh pointer is in a mapped slot, never only in `rax`."

  K1  THE POLL IS AT A CALL'S RETURN.  A poll that is not preceded by a call in its own straight-line path is not
      a safe point in the sense section 3 defines, and the frame map keyed by the return PC describes some other
      instant than the one collecting.
  K2  THE RESULT IS STORED.  At least one of the descriptor words the call returned -- rax and rdx -- reaches a
      slot before the poll.  ⭐ A SITE THAT STORES NOTHING IS GRADED BY WHAT THE CALLEE ACTUALLY RETURNS, read
      out of src/runtime's own declarations rather than guessed or hand-listed: VOID means THERE IS NO RESULT TO
      LOSE and the clause is VACUOUS, a NARROW return (int and friends) cannot hold a 64-bit pointer and is
      cleared by the callee-saved census's own D32 rule, and anything WIDE -- DESCR_t, a pointer, long, uint64_t
      -- is a MEMBER.  A callee whose declaration this reader cannot find, or which is declared with two
      different return types, is UNDECIDABLE and never vacuous.  ⛔ THE FIRST ROAD TRIED HERE WAS A LIVENESS
      WALK and it was the wrong road: it decided 0 of 72 sites, and the decisive fact was never liveness but the
      RETURN TYPE.  rt_gc_poll is a plain C function, so rax and rdx are caller-saved and NOTHING can live in
      them across the poll by the ABI; what matters is whether the callee returns something wide enough to be a
      pointer at all.  MEASURED over the shared witness set: all 72 are void (39) or int (33), so the clause is
      VACUOUS everywhere it does not apply and BLOCKING everywhere it does.
  K3  THE SLOT IS ONE THE COLLECTOR COVERS, AND THERE ARE TWO MECHANISMS, NOT ONE.  A store of rax or rdx in
      the window lands either inside a GC_LAY_DESCR / GC_LAY_PTR_GC entry of the graph's own frame map
      (ARCH-GC section 2b RULE 1b, the RBP activation frames) or as a TAGGED CELL ON THE ζ-SPINE
      (RULE 1a, `gc_cell_visit` inside `gc_walk_words`).  This is the clause section 3b (CEO-996) found had
      never been enforced; ⛔ THE FIRST ENFORCEMENT OF IT ASSERTED RULE 1b OVER A POPULATION RULE 1a OWNS and
      called 222 findings over 111 sites a defect.  See SPINE-CELL below -- the correction is MEASURED, not
      argued, and the class is still NAMED so that nothing goes dark.
  K4  ON EVERY PATH.  No label joins the window AFTER the last result store.  A label between the store and the
      poll is a path that reaches the poll WITHOUT passing the store, so the clause holds on one path and says
      nothing about the collection that happens on the other.  This clause is the cto's 2026-09-21 reading and is
      not in the page's words; it is what the page's words MEAN once the emitted text has branches in it.

⛔⭐⭐⭐ SPINE-CELL -- THE VERDICT THAT COST THIS FILE ITS FIRST 222 MEMBERS, AND THE A/B THAT PROVED IT
(cto, 2026-09-22, MODE DUO).  A call result stored as `mov [b+k],rax` / `mov [b+k+8],rdx` at a 16-BYTE-ALIGNED k
below the region base IS A WELL-FORMED DESCR: rax carries the tag word (`DESCR_t.v` is the low BYTE of the first
eight) and rdx carries the union word.  ARCH-GC section 2b RULE 1a gives the ζ-SPINE its own covering mechanism
for exactly this shape -- "the collector walks the spine from RSP to its base as an array of cells, reading
tags" -- and `x86_rt_gc_poll_res` says so in the emitter's own words: "spilled as a DESCR cell under rsp across
the poll and reloaded -- the walker sweeps [poll floor, stack top) and relocates it".  Grading that store
against the FRAME MAP alone is asking the wrong mechanism about it.

⛔ THIS IS NOT A WEAKENING ON A READING.  It is held by an A/B ON THE MECHANISM ITSELF, and the gate
test_gate_gc_the_spine_tagged_cell_walk_is_load_bearing.sh re-runs it: with SCRIP_GC_NO_SPINE_CELL=1 the spine
cell visit is skipped and NOTHING ELSE CHANGES.  Over the declared 52-witness name set at SCRIP_HEAP_MB=1,
SCRIP_GC_STRESS=3, SCRIP_GC_RELOC=1: 16 witnesses CHANGE THEIR ANSWER, 15 of them from the 23 that carry a
BELOW-REGION store.  hb_datblk dumps core, hb_nv SIGSEGVs on a stale pointer through the ZGC-STALE trap, and
hb_mkexpr_unmapped_spine_store -- the witness section 3b is named after -- goes `match` to `nomatch`.  The
spine walk is LOAD-BEARING for this population; the frame map never covered it and was never meant to.

⛔⭐ AND SPINE-CELL IS NOT A DEFECT FLOOR, WHICH COST THE FLEET A RED BEFORE IT WAS NOTICED (cto 2026-09-22).
The floor comparison graded every column with one polarity -- read ABOVE declared is WORSE -- and that rule owns
K1..K4 and UND.  It does NOT own SPINE.  SPINE counts stores COVERED by RULE 1a's mechanism, so a cure that turns
a bare poll into x86_rt_gc_poll_rec_sigma RAISES it: the ceo's e42cc0909 and c60097828 did exactly that and 14
witness/clause pairs went "ABOVE the declared floor", reported as a REGRESSION IN THE EMITTED SAFE-POINT SEQUENCE
when what had happened was the safe points getting better.  This is the same shape the ceo named law-shaped today
after three retractions in one day: A CHECKER ASSERTING A RULE THAT DOES NOT OWN THE POPULATION IT IS GRADING.
SPINE is therefore compared with BLOCKING_KEYS omitting it, and its movement is printed as SPINEMOVED in BOTH
DIRECTIONS and never blocks.  Neither direction is unambiguously bad -- a store moving INTO the mapped region
lowers it and is also a cure -- so the honest treatment is a census that is NAMED, not a floor that is enforced.

⛔ AND WHAT SPINE-CELL DOES NOT SAY, because a verdict that quietly becomes a pass is the failure the INSTRUMENT
LAWS exist against.  It is COUNTED IN ITS OWN COLUMN, declared in the floor and NAMED line by line -- it is not
folded into the green.  It does not say Rule 1a is as strong as a map: the spine walk FINDS the cell by stepping
8 bytes and trying, so a false cell earlier in the range can put it out of phase, and a tag word overwritten
before the collection drops the cell to a raw word (measured: one of six member pointer-halves on hb_datblk read
heap-RAW at one collection).  Making that coverage STATIC rather than discovered is the planner's row and it is
still open.  What SPINE-CELL says is narrower and true: THIS STORE IS COVERED BY A MECHANISM THIS FILE CAN NAME.

⛔ THE REACH BOUNDARY, WRITTEN FIRST SO NO READER TAKES A GREEN FOR MORE THAN IT IS.  This file walks FORWARD from
the call to the poll.  The unmapped-store census beside it walks BACKWARD from the poll and stops at a control
transfer -- correct for ITS question, the stores that precede this poll on every path, and WRONG as a reading of
this contract.  Taking that boundary for the property printed 1784 of 2275 results NEVER STORED, 78 percent, and
it was a fiction: hb_aggt.icn stores rax into [rbp+752], a mapped slot, four instructions before its poll, with a
`cmp al,104 / je` between, and the branch is where the backward walk stopped.  A shared reader's REACH is not the
property.  The reading is shared through build_frames(); the question is not shared and must not be.

⛔ WHAT A GREEN HERE DOES NOT SAY.  It does not say the collector visits the mapped slot -- that is gc_heap.c and
the cfo's file.  It does not say the value is SAFE: a store into a slot the map covers is still lost if the tag
the recognizer meets is one it refuses.  It does not cover class 3 of section 3c, a raw heap pointer returned in
a REGISTER PAIR with no store target at all, because a frame map describes memory and there is nothing to
classify; that class is the cfo's calling-convention decision and this file cannot see it.  It says exactly one
thing: the emitted side of the section 3 contract is CHECKED at every safe point this reader can place, and the
sites it cannot place are NAMED and ratcheted rather than counted green.

    it, and in procedure_write_253 -- the cfo's misaligned-stack witness -- it UNREACHES 40 of 74 call sites and
    leaves 9 undecidable, because the wired regime enters boxes through indirect jumps no anchor path crosses.
    So this walk starts at every `.type X, @function` label, every box port label, every procedure port label and
    `main`, with the parity the road fixes there.  MEASURED, NOT ASSUMED, AT THE ONE PLACE C ENTERS EMITTED CODE
    (cto 2026-09-22): the four hand-written entry shims in rt.c all JUMP into the port after their own pushes --
    rt_proc_enter moves rsp by -56, rt_proc_enter_named by -72, rt_proc_enter_barrier and rt_proc_enter_frag by
    -72 -- so from a C call's 8 mod 16 every one lands the port at 0 mod 16; the wiring's own jumps carry the grid
    the grid census holds at every decidable floor (3790 of 3790, CTO-103); and `main` is the ONE label libc
    calls, entered at 8, whose 65544-byte prologue puts it back on the grid.  A first cut called every column-0
    procedure label a called function and read TWELVE define-port polls MISALIGNED that the shims prove aligned;
    the rule is now: `main` (and the plant's `main_bx`) enter at 8, everything else enters on the grid, and every
    verdict names which.  Successors are the census's CFG restricted to the function's own text
    range; a call falls through (the callee returns to the same rsp).  The ABI requires rsp 0 mod 16 AT the call
    instruction, so a poll call at parity 8 is MISALIGNED: every C callee on that path runs misaligned and the
    first aligned SSE store faults -- the movaps in vsnprintf that convicted bb_call_value 67/70 with the

# THE BARE-POLL RE-SCREEN (the ceo's DONE-WHEN clause for row gc-the-116-bare-poll-sites-already-counted-as-done-are-
# re-screened-by-the-zero-collection-arm, CEO-1137/1144; cto 2026-09-23).
#
# THE QUESTION.  The census credits a site as POLLED when a poll is EMITTED after its allocating call; the bare form
# (x86_rt_gc_poll, 131 of 195 credited sites on 2026-09-23) roots nothing and had TWO convictions as a silent wrong
# answer with the collector never run (bb_binop_concat_slot 69 reverted at 58820a280, bb_goto_deferred 26/47 reverted
# at 7a1361373) and one as a wrong number (six rt_scan_needle sites answering 0 for 3000).  Presence is not evidence.
# This clause asks, per credited bare site: is there a NAMED witness whose EMISSION reaches that site and whose run at
# STRESS 0 in a large arena -- collections 0, grew 0, read from the run's own [GC-EXERCISE] line and never assumed --
# prints exactly its oracle-cut .ref, in mode 3 AND in mode 4?  A site with no such witness is UNWITNESSED and NAMED,
# never counted green; a witness whose run differs from its ref is DIVERGING and every site it covers is DIVERGING.
#
# THE JOIN.  The census names a site by its call line and prints (--list-polled) the poll line it credited, poll_at=
# <template>:<line>.  Since 2026-09-23 the bare poll helper stamps that same template:line into the emitted text as a
# note (x86_rt_gc_poll() is a macro over x86_rt_gc_poll_at(__FILE__, __LINE__); the note renders as a trailing
# "# gc_poll <base>:<line>" on the instruction before the call), so the reach of a witness is READ from its .s rather
# than inferred from a box kind.  ⛔ The text renderer drops a note when the instruction already carries one, so the
# reading counts notes against `call rt_gc_poll_asm` per witness and REFUSES (rc 2) on any mismatch: an instrument that
# could lose a site silently must say so instead.
#
# THE TABLE.  scripts/gc_bare_poll_witnesses.tsv is the DECLARED name set: one row per credited bare site, naming its
# witness or UNWITNESSED.  --write-bare-poll-table writes it from the programs on argv (the smallest ref-carrying witness
# that reaches each site wins); the reading grades the declared rows and names a row whose witness no longer reaches its
# site STALE and a row the census no longer credits RETIRED.  A pin is not a default: the stress-0 arm runs at
# SCRIP_HEAP_MB=512 with SCRIP_HEAP_KB removed, because the quantity it measures is the poll's PRESENCE with the collector
# never running, and a tiny arena would make every reading NOT-ZERO by construction (CEO-931 pin rule; the gate that runs
# this declares itself in the tiny-arena gate's pinned set).
