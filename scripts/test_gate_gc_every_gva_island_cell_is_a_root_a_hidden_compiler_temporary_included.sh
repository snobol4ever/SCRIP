#
# MEASURED 2026-09-30 on SCRIP b8a668968: the five-statement witness (P8 = *(X Y), Y = *(X 'q'), 'pq' P8; the cto's find,
# FINDING-snobol4-gc-nested-unevaluated-expression-dies-under-the-flip-plant-with-stress-2026-09-29.md) died rc 139
# [ZGC-STALE] under SCRIP_GC_PLANT_FLIP=1 SCRIP_GC_STRESS=1 in mode 3 AND mode 4, strcmp in rt_proc_find reading the
# poisoned ground from rt_defer_open_cell(cell=0x70001050). That cell is GVA slot 5, "PATV$0": bake layer 3 (1015e2916)
# gave the compiler's PATV$/SCV$/SNO$VL$ temporaries GVA slots registered with NO name (gva_name_hidden; mode 4 emits
# .quad 0 in __gva_names, mode 3 a null), and the collector reached a GVA cell ONLY through its NV entry's e->cell in
# core_gc_roots, so a nameless cell was never visited: a hardware watchpoint on the cell read ONE store (emitted code,
# the DT_X "EXPR$0" whose name is an HB_WSC block) and no collector relocation through collections #4..#6.
#
# SCRIP 7043c34e8 (the cto's bake layer 10, landed beside this cure) made a DT_X carry its static star record, so those
# two witnesses no longer point into the arena and pass on origin without the cure; they stay as the DT_X road's
# regression. THE DISCRIMINATING WITNESS on 7043c34e8 is the eager call: S ('x' F(I) G(I + 1) 'y') snapshots each call's
# heap string into a nameless PATV$ cell before the match, G's first (the pre-args run last to first), and F's call
# collects before the match reads G's cell -- rc 139 [ZGC-STALE] on 7043c34e8 under the flip plant at stress 1, sbl -bf's
# answer with the cure.
#
# THE CURE: gc_root_gva() in gc_heap.c walks every cell of the island, RT_GVA_VA[0 .. g_sxt_gva_n) (the count
# rt_gva_island records), as a root region at every collection; core_gc_roots no longer visits e->cell's value, so each
# cell is visited exactly once whether it has a name or not.
#
# ARMS: (a) THE PROPERTY: the three witnesses answer their sbl -bf ref, rc 0, no [ZGC-STALE], under the flip plant at stress
# 1 and 3, mode 3 and mode 4 (on b8a668968 the two DT_X witnesses died rc 139 in both modes at stress 1; on 7043c34e8 the eager call dies, the other two pass); (b) THE PLANT APPLIED: every run
# of (a) printed the [GC-FLIP] plant line -- a green under a plant that never ran measures nothing; (c) THE WITNESS
# REACHES A NAMELESS CELL: its mode-4 __gva_names carries a .quad 0 entry and the program resolves a deferred reference
# through rt_defer_open_cell; (d) the source: gc_collect_ex calls gc_root_gva and the NV walk no longer visits e->cell.
