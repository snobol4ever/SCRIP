# icon-jcon-class-real-str-icon-real-str-divergence (minted seat02 2026-09-04, cured seat05 SCRIP 19f5bfd9a,
# gated hq_I 2026-09-10).
#
# SCRIP has TWO real-to-string functions and THAT IS CORRECT, not a defect:
#   real_str()      src/runtime/string_ops.c -- SPITBOL's own full-precision convention, SNOBOL4's answer
#   icon_real_str() src/runtime/string_ops.c -- Icon's 10-significant-digit convention, iconx's answer
# The row was minted recommending "delete one function and repoint every caller", and that recommendation is
# WRONG: on the SAME literal 101559956668416.0 the sbl oracle prints `101559956668416.` and iconx prints
# `1.015599567e+14`. They are two correct answers for two languages. Merging them would have silently broken
# SNOBOL4's hard FAIL=0 bar, which is why this gate grades BOTH sides on that one literal -- a future seat who
# "unifies" the two functions trips arm B, not a board six minutes later.
#
# Arm A: Icon, 13 probes, refs cut from /home/resources/icon-master's own icont/iconx, both modes m3 and m4.
#   The probes are not decoration; each pins a constant that was re-derived empirically and that a plausible
#   rewrite gets wrong:
#     101559956668416.0     10 significant digits, and the exponent is SIGNED (`e+14`, never `e14`)
#     9999999999.6          rounding CARRIES into the exponent -> `1e+10`, not `9999999999.6`
#     99999.99999999        the carry lands the other way -> `100000.0`, fixed notation
#     1.0e10                one significant digit survives stripping, so NO decimal point at all -> `1e+10`
#     1.0e-5                the small-magnitude threshold, and a two-digit negative exponent -> `1e-05`
#     0.0001 / 1e100 / 1e-100 / 0.0 / -0.5 / 2.0   the fixed/exponential boundary in both directions
# Arm B: SNOBOL4, the same literal, ref cut from the sbl oracle -- the control arm that keeps the two apart.
#   REFUSES rc=2 if the sbl oracle is absent rather than passing on one arm and calling it a verdict.
