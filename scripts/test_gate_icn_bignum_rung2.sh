# Icon large integers, RUNG 2: the places a NEW TYPE has to be taught about, once arithmetic works.
# Row icon-bignum-rung-2-image-string-equality-table-keys-and-mixed-real-arithmetic.
#
# Measured 2026-09-06 against iconx on the tree where rungs 0 and 1 are green -- so each of these is a
# gap in a CONSUMER of the value, not in the arithmetic:
#   image(2^100)                        SCRIP prints the string "1267" (truncated, and quoted as a
#                                       STRING image); iconx prints integer(~10^30)
#   string(2^100) == "1267...376"       ⛔ THE FIRST VERSION OF THIS ARM MEASURED SOMEONE ELSE'S DEFECT.
#                                       Written inline it fails -- but so does `write("42" == "42")`, with no
#                                       large integer anywhere, and so does it on a tree built from before
#                                       any of today's changes (worktree control). Icon's string comparison
#                                       yields nothing unless an operand is a VARIABLE; that is a separate,
#                                       PRE-EXISTING defect with its own row and its own two-literal witness.
#                                       The arm now binds the string to a variable first, so what it grades
#                                       is the large integer's rendering rather than the comparison operator.
#   T[2^100] := "big"; T[2^100]         SCRIP's lookup misses; iconx finds it -- a large integer is not
#                                       yet hashable as a table key
#   2^100 + 1.5                         SCRIP returns an integer; iconx returns 1.2676506e+30, because
#                                       MIXED arithmetic promotes to REAL, not to a wider integer
#
# ⭐ THE CONTROL ARMS ARE RUNGS 0 AND 1 THEMSELVES: a plain big comparison and a big remainder are
# graded here too, so a rung-2 cure that reaches back into the arithmetic is caught by this gate rather
# than by the two gates it would also break.
# ⛔ REFUSES rc=2 unless all 12 runs (6 witnesses x 2 modes) are graded, and rc=2 if the oracle is absent.
