# test_gate_gc_every_asm_entry_shim_tags_its_callee_saved_pushes.sh -- A HAND-WRITTEN BOX ENTRY HANDS THE WALKER A
# TAG, NOT A RAW WORD (cto 2026-09-21; row prolog-every-asm-entry-shim-pushes-callee-saved-registers-as-tagged-
# cells-not-raw-words, ceo CEO-1099; law RULES.md FACT RULE THE COLLECTOR GUESSES NOTHING, CEO-812; ARCH-GC 6.2i).
#
# WHAT IS HELD HERE, IN ONE SENTENCE.  bb_glue_enter_c2bb saves the registers it spills as TAGGED CELLS so the
# walker reads them as data; the hand-written asm entry shims push the same registers RAW, into a region no
# compile-time frame map describes.  Of the five, exactly one is heap-bearing by the tree's own convention -- r13
# is the Σ subject pointer and r15d its length, which is why the glue stores that PAIR as one DT_S cell -- so a
# raw push of r13 puts a live heap pointer where the walker can only guess at it, and where a MOVING collector
# will never relocate it.
#
# ⛔⭐ THE RUN ARM THIS GATE DOES NOT HAVE, AND THE MEASUREMENT THAT TOOK IT AWAY.  The obvious arm is to count
# the walker's raw spine words and ratchet them down.  THAT COLUMN DOES NOT DISCRIMINATE THE CURE AND THIS GATE
# WOULD HAVE SHIPPED A FLAPPING RATCHET IF IT HAD USED ONE.  Measured 2026-09-21 on ONE unchanged binary and ONE
# witness whose CONTENT never changed, varying only the LENGTH OF THE PATH the program was invoked by:
#     UNCURED build:  pathlen+1 -> s_raw_heap=3   +5 -> 6   +10 -> 3   +20 -> 3   +30 -> 6   +40 -> 3   +60 -> 6
#     CURED   build:  pathlen+1 -> s_raw_heap=6   +5 -> 6   +30 -> 3
# The quantity is BISTABLE between two stack-layout states (3 and 6, subject-pointing 2 and 5), it flips on an
# input that has nothing to do with the collector, and the cured and uncured builds BOTH span both states.  The
# answer is byte-identical to the oracle at every point.  A ratchet on that column grades which layout the run
# happened to land in.  ⛔ THIS MATTERS BEYOND THIS GATE: s_raw_heap is one of the columns the stack-completeness
# measure asserts to zero, so that measure needs a layout-invariant statistic or it will flap for the same reason.
#
# ⭐ SO ARM B GRADES WHAT IS INVARIANT AND REFUSES THE REST.  It proves the run was NOT INERT (the road fired, a
# collection really happened -- CEO-1044) and that the witness answers its ORACLE.  It does not grade a count it
# has just shown to be noise.  A gate that reports a number it cannot trust is the failure the INSTRUMENT LAWS
# exist against, and reporting NO number is the honest form of not having one yet.
#
# ⛔ WHAT A GREEN HERE DOES NOT SAY.  It does not say the shim frames are fully described: rbx, r12 and r14 are
# still saved raw under a DECLARED CONVENTION (r12 a pointer clamped into the dcap region, rbx the live frontier,
# r14 tagged DT_I by the glue), and the census NAMES them on every run rather than letting "raw" go silent.  It
# does not say the raw push was ever observed to produce a wrong answer -- it was not, on this witness.  It says
# the one word the tree agrees is heap-bearing is handed to the walker tagged instead of guessed at.
#
# ⭐ FAIL-ONCE, BY THE POPULATION RATHER THAN BY A PLANT.  Arm A is RED on the shims still owed and GREEN on each
# one cured, so the detector is proven to discriminate on real members every time it runs.
# ⛔ ARM B GRADES THROUGH corpus_suite_harness.classify AND NOT THROUGH ITS OWN COMPARISON, because a seat
# grading GC work with a bare cmp or diff is minting phantom reds right now (the coo, relayed by the ceo at
# CEO-1100): classify rstrips both sides, honours a declared want_rc, applies line masks, and -- the reason it
# matters here -- SEPARATES HANG FROM FAIL, which is exactly the distinction CEO-1098 requires a loaded box to
# preserve. This gate's witness is simple enough that a direct string compare happened to agree; relying on that
# is the reasoning the fleet fact warns against, so it does not.
