#
# Run EXACTLY N iterations per kernel (N fixed, COMMITTED, never a wall-clock deadline) and report
# throughput (iterations/s) for gnu (gprolog) / swi (swipl) / m3 / m4. This is the mirror of
# test_bench_prolog_timed.sh (angle 1: LIVE doubling search each run). Angle 2 instead reads N from the
# committed table corpus/benchmarks/prolog/fixed-iter-n.tsv and GENERATES the counted wrapper around the
# pristine kernel at run time -- so N here is HISTORICAL data, not derived live, which is the independence
# property the cross-proof needs (angle 1 = live search this run; angle 2 = pre-committed N).
#
# ⭐⛔ THE WRAPPER IS GENERATED, NEVER CHECKED IN (CEO-567, RULES.md:321; hq_P 2026-09-13, row
# bench-kernels-are-not-pristine-and-carry-no-refs-ceo-567-conversion). This arm used to EXECUTE
# corpus/benchmarks/prolog/vanroy/<k>.pl -- 21 checked-in files each carrying a frozen `main :- l__(N).`,
# i.e. THE ITERATION COUNT LIVING INSIDE THE ARTIFACT UNDER MEASUREMENT, which is the thing CEO-567
# forbids. Worse, those 21 were generated from the PRE-conversion bench/ sources, so each wrapped an old
# self-timing main/0: MEASURED on SCRIP 5b17c350f / corpus d97c5fe87, the last vanroy board read
# ok=0 bad=21 with EVERY m3 and m4 cell NA -- 13 of them LOOP-OUTPUT-MISMATCH(lines=0/N) because
# existence_error(wall_us/1) killed the answer and exited 0, and gnu itself failed on ham/queens_8/queens.
# The directory was a generated artifact that had drifted away from the sources it was generated from,
# and nothing reported the drift because the rival columns kept printing real numbers.
# Now: N comes from the TSV, the source is bench/<k>.pl VERBATIM, and scripts/bench_prolog_wrap.sh builds
# the counted form per engine into a temp file. One authority for the wrapper shape, none of it on disk.
#
# ⛔ CORRECTNESS IS NOT RE-VERIFIED HERE, but it is no longer taken on trust either: loop_check()
# compares this run's stdout byte-for-byte against N copies of bench/<k>.ref (the oracle-cut ref), so
# a kernel whose loop did not loop N times reports LOOP-OUTPUT-MISMATCH and never a rate. The single-shot
