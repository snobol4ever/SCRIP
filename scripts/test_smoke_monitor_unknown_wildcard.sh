# test_smoke_monitor_unknown_wildcard.sh — verify monitor_sync_bin.py's
# grade_keys grades a pair with MWT_UNKNOWN on one side UNGRADED: it does not
# DIVERGE on the type byte, and it is never a match either.
# ⛔ AMENDED 2026-09-23 (the coo, row monitor-the-controller-reads-an-untyped-
# value-as-agree-…): until then MWT_UNKNOWN was a WILDCARD that read AGREE, and
# Check 3 below asserted that; an untyped value is now UNGRADED, counted and
# named on the controller's VERDICT line (test_gate_monitor_an_untyped_value_
# grades_ungraded_never_agree.sh is the blocking gate).  Checks 2 and 3 also
# could not import the module from anywhere but scripts/monitor: their quoted
# heredocs never expanded $S4E, so the path is now passed as MON_DIR.
#
# Background: SPITBOL's bridge (x64/osint/monitor_ipc_runtime.c
# spl_block_to_wire) emits MWT_UNKNOWN(=255) for nmblk/ptblk/atblk/
# tbblk/cdblk/efblk because their type-words are not yet exported.
# CSN and dot emit the correct typed kind.  The compare must succeed
# when one side is UNKNOWN and the other is a real type, as long as
# kind+name+value match.
#
# Expected outcome: a 2-way `spl dot` run on a program that creates
# a TABLE() (which spl tags UNKNOWN, dot tags TABLE) should NOT
# DIVERGE — the run reaches END, and its VERDICT reads UNGRADED=1.
#
# This test does NOT require Python keys_match unit-style; it
# integration-tests via the real harness.
