# stored-pattern-thunks-run-on-the-rsp-spine-when-recede-free-no-rbp-frame-no-map-cell-no-zero-fill (Lon 2026-09-30, in-chat to the
# ceo: "Ensure that pre-compiled patterns do no carry the extra weight of an RBP activation frame when just the RSP spine will
# suffice."; Lon 2026-10-01, in-chat to the cto, ordering this step first). A stored-pattern thunk that runs on the RSP spine alone
# (SCRIP_BLOB_SPINE=1, the frameless road until the row flips the default) still needs three things its RBP frame used to give it:
#   (1) THE HEAD. The pattern's DTP (rdx at entry) and, under casmark, r12 lived at [rbp-24] and [rbp-32]. A var box reading a
#       snapshot slot (P = SPAN(X) reads X from the pattern's own header) read [rbp-24] of the CALLER's frame, error 188 (span_1).
#       Now the thunk carves its head on the spine as TAGGED cells -- {DT_P, rdx} and {DT_I, r12} -- so the collector sees a DESCR,
#       never a raw word, and the reader addresses rsp at the compile-time depth the zd planner already knows (zd_out).
#   (2) THE GAMMA DEPTH. The gamma tail read the continuation pair at a depth that counted only scratch-cell leaves, 16 where the
#       var and coerce cells made it 48; the gamma depth is now the planner's own depth at every gamma exit, which must agree.
#   (3) THE OMEGA DEPTH. A framed thunk's omega is mov rsp, rbp, so a box could leave carves behind on its way out (POS fails to
#       omega at depth 32 in the ladder's MK pattern); frameless, every omega exit that lands deeper than zero goes through a pad
#       that pops exactly the rest -- its depth less its own carve, the collapsed beta carves and the staged pop.
# Measured on 270cfc43b over the 757-entry pattern-feature slice of the SNOBOL4 master, both modes: 48 entries red under the flag
# that pass on defaults (33 SIGSEGV, 15 rc 1) before; after, the flag arm reads the defaults' 1484 of 1514 entry for entry.
# THE WITNESS has one statement per class; the oracle is sbl (lib_oracle_flags.sh). The gate grades both modes under the flag and
# on defaults, and checks the .s: a frameless thunk exists and every frameless thunk that reads its head carves it tagged.
