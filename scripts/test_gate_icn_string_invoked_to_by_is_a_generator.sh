# test_gate_icn_string_invoked_to_by_is_a_generator.sh -- string invocation of the ternary "..." operator.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: TWO ternary operators were unreachable by string invocation -- "..." and "[:]" -- while every
# other Icon operator was already reachable -- "+" "-" "*" "||"
# "<" unary and binary, and "!" which is itself a GENERATOR -- and only "..." raised ERROR 022 Undefined
# function called. It is the one operator whose native form is a generator box AND whose by-name arm was
# missing, so a single-DESCR_t return could not carry it: the cure pumps it through the same ICN_OPGEN_t
# path "!" already used. The arity-3 shape is the oracle's own contract -- icont rejects "..."(1,5) with
# runtime error 106, because `to` and `to by` are one ternary operator in Icon.
#
# THE CONTROL ARMS ARE IN THE TABLE ON PURPOSE: "!" and "+" are graded here beside the cure, because the
# cure inserted an arm AHEAD of the "!" arm in the same dispatch -- a gate that only grades the new
# behaviour cannot see the sibling it displaced. `native` grades `1 to 5 by 2`, which was already correct
# and must stay so: the string form is required to agree with the operator it names, not merely with the oracle.
