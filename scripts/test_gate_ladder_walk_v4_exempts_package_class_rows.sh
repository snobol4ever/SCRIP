# test_gate_ladder_walk_v4_exempts_package_class_rows.sh -- THE ACCEPTANCE GATE for row ladder-walk-v4-exempts-package-
# class-rows (ceo CEO-230 -> hq_T 2026-09-04; law RULES.md § FACT RULES THE PACKAGE-CLASS RULE, on Lon 13:20: the
# percentage IS the V column).
#
# THE DEFECT: util_ladder_walk.py's V4 RANK INVERSION flagged EVERY FREE off-ladder row at rank 0/1 -- including the class
# rows minted from a vendored-package census (icon-arizona-class-…, pascal-fpc-class-…, prolog-inria-class-…), which are
# LADDER-RANK WORK by law and belong at rank 1. The ceo's 16:14 walk printed 18 such lines; on the 2026-09-04 evening
# queue the count was 27 of 62 V4 lines, so the report the ceo reads every tick was nearly half noise, and a report that
# is half noise is a report nobody reads (the same finding that turned V6 into a census).
#
# ⛔ THE CURE IS BY SHAPE, NOT BY A LIST OF PACKAGE NAMES, and this gate pins that: a list is a census that drifts
# silently the day a new suite is vendored -- its class rows would be flagged again and read as genuine inversions by
# whoever had stopped seeing the old ones. The shape the law defines is <lang>-<package>-class-<slug>: a recognised
# language prefix, exactly ONE package token, then -class-. Two tokens (prolog-master-red-class-…) is a MASTER-BOARD red
# class, not a package class, and stays a V4 candidate.
#
# ARMS, hermetic (a scratch plan + a scratch postoffice under mktemp; the LIVE postoffice is never read):
#   ARM 1  a <lang>-<package>-class-* row FREE at rank 1 is NOT flagged            (pre-cure: flagged -- the fail-once arm)
#   ARM 2  a genuine off-ladder rank-1 row IS still flagged                        (control: the cure did not delete V4's job)
#   ARM 3  the exemption is COUNTED on one visible line, never silent              (pre-cure: no such line)
#   ARM 4  by SHAPE: a two-token -master-red-class- row at rank 1 is still flagged
#   ARM 5  rank 2+ was never V4's business, either way
#   ARM 6  a PRE-SHAPE package row (no -class- token) is exempt too -- 15 were minted before the rule
#   ARM 7  the package token may sit at segment two (pascal-iso7185-pat-*, prolog-swi-tests-*)
#   ARM 8  a row whose second segment is an ordinary word (snobol4-every-non-package-...) is NOT exempt
#   ARM 9  the vocabulary is CENSUSED FROM DISK: a freshly vendored package directory exempts its rows with no
#          edit to this script -- the arm a hand-typed list cannot pass
#   ARM 10 an unreadable census turns the exemption OFF with a visible warning, and flags package rows again
# FAIL-ONCE PROVEN 2026-09-04: SUT=<pre-cure util_ladder_walk.py> fails exactly ARM 1 and ARM 3, passes 2/4/5.
# EXIT: 0 all arms · 1 an arm failed · 2 REFUSED (no python3, SUT missing, mktemp failed, or the walk itself refused).
