"""util_fix_folding_dialect.py -- uppercase SPITBOL KEYWORDS in the folding-dialect programs so they mean the same thing under
`sbl -bf` (case-SENSITIVE) that they meant under `sbl -b` (case-FOLDING).

DECISION PROCEDURE (per program):
  needs_fix  iff the program is BROKEN under -bf today: rc != 0, or (a pinned .ref exists and the
             -bf output does not match it).  A program already correct under -bf is LEFT ALONE --
             the corpus holds BOTH dialects, and beauty.sno / 210_indirect_ref.sno depend on
             `Integer` != INTEGER and `bal` != BAL.  Blanket uppercasing would break them.
  accept     iff after the edit, -bf rc == 0 AND output == pin (if pinned) else == the -b output
             the program produced BEFORE the edit.  Otherwise REVERT and report.
⛔ TWO DIRECTORIES ARE NEVER OPENED, BY CONSTRUCTION (OFF_LIMITS below, enforced in closure() so the
   walk never descends and in the write loop as a belt): corpus/programs/lon/ (RULES.md ABSOLUTE --
   do not run, do not read) and corpus/programs/include/ (HQ interim s191 -- inherits the do-not-read
   half pending Lon's credential ruling).  Both locks are READ locks, not just write locks: closure()
   open()s every file it reaches, and a secret read into a transcript has been copied somewhere new.
   CONSEQUENCE, STATED SO IT IS NOT MISREAD AS A BUG: a gimpel program whose fix needs an uppercased
   file under programs/include/ cannot be completed, so the accept test fails and the driver REVERTS
   and names it.  That is the correct outcome, not a failure of the tool."""

# strings) -- so the accept test REVERTED a good conversion.  These three lines are not a semantic

Measured: it did, over all 42 movers instead of a reviewed 21.  Nothing was damaged -- every file failed the accept test and was reverted, which is the guard working -- but a reader must be able to import this module for its helpers without editing the corpus.
