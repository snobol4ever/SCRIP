read -r -d '' TABLE <<'TSV' || true
undef_var_arith	SAME	null-valued operand coerces to 0 in both engines, identical accepted result
undef_label_goto	DEFENSIBLE	both detect+report; oracle exits rc=0 with a fatal dump, SCRIP exits rc=1 with a concise diagnostic
bad_type_arith	DEFENSIBLE	FIXED (was WRONG): SCRIP now fails the statement on a non-numeric operand across +/-/*//,** left+right (arithmetic.c is_numeric_like guard); &ERRTYPE stays unpopulated, same residual gap as bad_type_builtin/div_by_zero
bad_type_builtin	DEFENSIBLE	SCRIP fails the statement correctly (matches oracle's control flow) but leaves &ERRTYPE unpopulated
div_by_zero	DEFENSIBLE	SCRIP fails the statement safely; oracle instead hard-crashes its own error-report path (known SPITBOL fragility)
subscript_range	SAME	both engines fail the out-of-declared-bounds assignment identically, &ERRTYPE 0 on both sides
wrong_arity	SAME	both engines silently discard the extra call argument and compute the same result
unterminated_string	SAME	both engines cleanly refuse to compile with a comparable diagnosis
duplicate_label	SAME	FIXED this session (was WRONG): parser now rejects a genuine duplicate label, matching oracle's Error 217
missing_end	SAME	FIXED this session (was WRONG): parser now requires an END statement, matching oracle's refusal
deep_recursion	DEFENSIBLE	FIXED (was WRONG): libscrip_rt.so SIGSEGV handler detects the stack-guard-page fault and reports ERROR 246 cleanly, rc=1; oracle detects the same condition but exits rc=0 with its own fatal dump (same asymmetry already accepted for undef_label_goto)
huge_string	DEFENSIBLE	SCRIP enforces no MAXLNGTH-style string-length ceiling; a reasonable modern default, not an instability
end_star_no_boundary	SAME	'*' jammed onto END with no boundary (no ';', no whitespace, no true column 1) is not a valid trailing-comment start in either engine -- both fail to find a valid END and refuse (snobol4-trailing-star-comment-not-lexed witness 3)
