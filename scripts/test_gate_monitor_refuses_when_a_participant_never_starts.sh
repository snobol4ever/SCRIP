# test_gate_monitor_refuses_when_a_participant_never_starts.sh — the sync-step monitor must REFUSE (rc=2)
# with a NAMED reason when a participant never opens its FIFO pair, and must never hang to a timeout.
#
# ⛔ THE DEFECT THIS GRADES (hq_T 2026-09-09, ceo brief `the-ipc-sync-step-monitor-does-not-run-and-lon-is-
# counting-on-it`, red proof below). monitor_sync_bin.py's open_pair() was two BLOCKING os.open() calls on
# FIFOs. A FIFO opened O_RDONLY blocks until a writer appears and O_WRONLY until a reader appears -- with no
# timeout of their own -- so when a participant died during startup the controller blocked forever, printed
# NOTHING (its first log line comes after the open), and the harness sat in an unbounded `wait`. An external
# `timeout` eventually killed the process group, whose EXIT trap then deleted the scratch dir holding the
# only copy of the answer.
#
# ⭐ THE MEASURED RED, on the ceo's own witness (snoflake string-pad.sno): rc=124 after 180s, ctrl.out zero
# bytes, and `cat: .scratch/monitor_auto_XXX/ctrl.out: No such file or directory`. BOTH participants had
# exited INSIDE THE FIRST SECOND, each having written its reason to its .err file, while the controller went
# on waiting 141s+ for writers that no longer existed. The instrument could not tell "measured and clean"
# from "never ran" -- and it deleted the evidence on its way out. AFTER the cure: rc=2 in 20s, naming the
# participant, with that .err surfaced.
#
# ⭐ WHY THE FIXTURE USES A LOWERCASE `end`: under the mandated case-sensitive oracle flags (`sbl -bf`,
# lib_oracle_flags.sh) SPITBOL does not recognise `end` as END, so it refuses the file during startup and
# never reaches the monitor bridge. That is the cheapest way to produce a participant that legitimately
# never starts, and it needs no corpus program -- so this gate cannot be broken by a corpus re-grid.
