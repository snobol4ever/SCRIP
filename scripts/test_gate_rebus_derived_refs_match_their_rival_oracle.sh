# test_gate_rebus_derived_refs_match_their_rival_oracle.sh -- A NO-RIVAL LANGUAGE'S REF IS DERIVED, AND
# THE DERIVATION IS RE-COMPUTED HERE RATHER THAN BELIEVED.  CEO-607 (2026-09-12, hq_C's ASK, option (a)).
#
# ⛔ THE PROBLEM THIS EXISTS FOR.  Rebus has no independent rival implementation, so CEO-391's one-oracle-
# per-language has no binary to name for it and `corpus/benchmarks/rebus/*.reb` can never carry an
# oracle-cut ref.  The tempting repair -- run SCRIP and save what it printed -- is the one repair that
# measures nothing: A REF CUT FROM THE IMPLEMENTATION IT GRADES PROVES ONLY THAT THE IMPLEMENTATION IS
# DETERMINISTIC, and Rebus is the one language where that mistake is easy to make because nothing else can
# be asked.  CEO-607 rules the answer: the ref is DERIVED, the derivation is RECORDED beside it, and the
# strongest derivation is a CROSS-LANGUAGE COMPUTATION of the same kernel under a real oracle, with the
# hand arithmetic as the second witness.
#
# ⭐ AND A RECORDED DERIVATION THAT NOBODY RE-EXECUTES IS A CLAIM, NOT A MEASUREMENT.  A static sidecar
# rots exactly the way this tree's digests rot -- it stays readable and persuasive while the thing it
# describes moves underneath it.  So the record does not stand alone: this gate re-runs each rival kernel
# under the LIVE oracle every time and diffs that output against the .ref the Rebus kernel is graded by.
# The .derivation file is the human half; this gate is the half that can fail.
#
# THE ARMS, per kernel named in the table below:
#   1  the kernel, its .ref and its .derivation all exist (a derived ref with no derivation beside it is
#      exactly the authored-number-nobody-can-check that the ruling forbids).
#   2  the .derivation NAMES its rival fixture by path, and that fixture exists -- the record points at a
#      real program, never at a remembered one.
#   3  the rival runs under the live SNOBOL4 oracle (`sbl -bf`) and its stdout is BYTE-IDENTICAL to the
#      .ref.  This is the derivation itself, re-performed.
#   4  the hand arithmetic recorded as WITNESS 2 is present in the .derivation and names the same number
#      the .ref carries -- two independent witnesses agreeing, which is the whole point of recording two.
#
# ⛔ IT DOES NOT RUN SCRIP AT ALL, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE.  This gate grades the REF, not the compiler.
# Whether SCRIP agrees with the ref is the benchmark harness's question and a separate verdict; if this
# gate ran SCRIP too, a seat could satisfy it by changing the ref to whatever SCRIP prints -- which is the
# circularity the ruling exists to close.
#
# REFUSES rc=2 when it cannot measure (oracle missing, corpus missing, mktemp failure).  A test that
# cannot measure refuses; it never skips-as-success (RULES.md; CLAUDE.md § Testing).
