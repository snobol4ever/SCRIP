# ⛔⭐ A MISSING INPUT IS A REFUSAL, NEVER AN ORACLE FAILURE. Until 2026-09-06 this gate named the two
# programs at $D/claws5.sno and $D/treebank.sno, paths the corpus re-grid retired (they are per-program
# subdirectories now). cat printed "No such file or directory", sbl was then handed a file holding only the
# two-line control-card prepend, exited non-zero, and the script printed "claws5: sbl FAILED" and DEMO-FULL
# 3WAY: FAIL. That reads as a correctness verdict about the ORACLE on a run that never happened -- and it was
# quoted as one, in a landing commit message, by an HQ (hq_S, SCRIP 0fc3302b9: "the sbl oracle fails claws5
# and treebank; not SCRIP"). seat04 found it by looking at the script rather than its exit status.
# ⭐ The general form is this house's own: an instrument that cannot measure must REFUSE (rc=2), because a
# script that refuses and a script that ran look identical from the outside if you only read a status.
