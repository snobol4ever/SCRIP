# test_gate_progress_configuration_declarations_do_not_regress.sh -- THE CONFIGURATION RATCHET: A LANE THAT HAS
# DECLARED WHAT IT EXERCISED MAY NEVER SILENTLY STOP, AND NO WRITER MAY STILL BE EMITTING THE OLD COLUMN WIDTH
# (coo 2026-09-21; ceo rank 1 at CEO-1058, "the ratchet is still rank 1 as ruled").
#
# ⛔⭐ THE HOLE THIS CLOSES IS IN A GUARD I LANDED MYSELF THIS MORNING, AND IT IS A HOLE OF SHAPE, NOT OF CARE.
# util_progress_append.py refuses an undeclared row in exactly ONE case: when a GC axis is set IN THE WRITER'S
# OWN PROCESS ENVIRONMENT. That is correct and it is bounded, and the writer's own comment says why -- "the
# runner may set the axis per-child, so an empty environment here is an ABSENCE OF EVIDENCE about the child".
# A runner that forks its children with SCRIP_GC_STRESS set and appends from a clean parent therefore meets NO
# REFUSAL AT ALL. The undeclared population can grow forever and the guard can never fire on it. A ratchet is
# the only thing that closes a hole of that shape: not "declare or refuse" at the moment of writing, which the
# writer cannot always know, but "having declared once, you may not stop", which the TABLE always knows.
#
# ⛔⭐ AND IT IS JUDGED AGAINST THE LIVE TABLE ON PURPOSE. This is the clause the ceo asked be applied (CEO-1058):
# A HERMETIC GATE THAT CONSTRUCTS ITS SUBJECT FRESH CANNOT SEE A DEFECT THAT EXISTS ONLY IN THE LONG-LIVED
# ARTEFACT. test_gate_progress_append_writes_a_row.sh was green for FIFTEEN DAYS while `fingerprint` was
# unreadable in 3.58M rows, for exactly the reason we built it that way: its mktemp table always gets a complete
# header on first touch, so the subject it graded could not exhibit the defect. Arm 1 below therefore reads the
# REAL table. Arms 2-6 are fixtures, and every one of them plants a table that ALREADY EXISTS and ALREADY
# CARRIES HISTORY IN THE OLD SHORT SHAPE before the arm writes a single row.
#
#   1  LIVE: the real table passes the ratchet at the pinned baseline (rc 1 = a lane regressed; rc 2 = UNPROVEN)
#   2  ARM A FIRES: a short row appended AFTER the baseline is named -- and the identical short rows BEFORE it
#      are NOT, which is what proves the baseline actually bounds the judgement instead of decorating it
#   3  ARM B FIRES: a lane that declared and then went undeclared is named, with its first declaration quoted
#   4  SEAM/CONTROL: a lane that has NEVER declared appending `undeclared` is ACCEPTED -- the ratchet forbids
#      REGRESSION, not ABSENCE (see the standing note below; this arm is why the gate is landable at all)
#   5  FLOOR: an empty window REFUSES rc=2 and does not report success over a population of nothing
#   6  THE BASELINE IS PINNED TO ITS COMMIT: the constant matches f839e933b's own commit time, so nobody can
#      slide the window forward until the table is green
#
# ⛔ WHAT THIS GATE DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO, AND THE NUMBER THAT DECIDED IT: it does not red a lane that has
# NEVER declared. Measured on the live table the day it was written, exactly ONE measurer in the fleet had ever
# written a declared configuration -- hq_snocone, 12096 rows -- and the other nine had not; hq_pascal's `pat`
# suite alone carries 854 full-width undeclared rows since the baseline. A ratchet on ABSENCE would have been a
# fleet-wide red on arrival, and a gate nobody can be green under is turned off rather than obeyed. The floor
# rises one lane at a time, by that lane's own first declaration, and from then on it cannot fall.
#
# Cost: ~14 s, and it is a FULL SCAN of a 3.6M-row / 525 MB table that grows about 16k rows a day -- so this
# cost grows with the table, by roughly 4% a day at today's rate. A tail-seek would make it O(window), and it is
# deliberately NOT done here: a seek that lands slightly wrong silently SHRINKS the population and the ratchet
# goes green over the rows it failed to read, which is the "instrument reports success while doing nothing"
# failure this gate exists to prevent. Correctness over speed for an instrument whose whole job is not to lie.
# Revisit when the cost is felt, as an economy decision for the ceo (CEO-1046), not a unilateral one here.
# BLOCKING in `make test` with the cost line above (CEO-1045); NOT in `make preflight` (CEO-1046: it reads a
# live external artefact, so it is not hermetic and does not belong in the cheap hermetic set).
#
# PROVEN RED BEFORE THE CURE (CEO-1049), live table, 2026-09-21: the SAME ratchet with --baseline pulled back to
# 00:00Z the same day reads ⛔ RED, ARM A, 16298 SHORT ROWS of 31082 across FOUR measurers -- hq_snocone 8736,
# cto 4032, hq_pascal 3444, ceo 86 -- and at the pinned baseline reads ✅ GREEN, 0 short of 15638. Same code,
# same table, one parameter: a before/after pair on one tree plus the one change (RULES.md INSTRUMENT LAWS).
