# bake_noise_floor_snobol4_timed.sh -- measure and record the RUN-TO-RUN
# dispersion of every (benchmark, engine) row in the TIME-based family.
#
# ⛔ WHY THIS EXISTS.  A benchmark instrument that does not know its own noise
# floor cannot tell a regression from weather.  s148 convicted the md5 blast
# -radius sweep for exactly this.  The trap repeated itself here in a subtler
# form: the floor was first measured on ONE kernel (arith_loop, cv 1.3%) and
# was about to be written into the runner as a GLOBAL "~4%" constant.  Measured
# per row, the real spread is 0.7% .. 37.7% -- the floor is a property of the
# (KERNEL, ENGINE) PAIR, not of the harness.  Generalising one row's floor to
# the suite is the same error in new clothes, so the floor is baked per row.
#
# ⛔ row bench-external-cpu-and-elapsed-clock (Lon s200 directive, FINDING-2026-08-22-s253):
# every rep below is now ALSO measured by tools/bench_rusage -- ONE external instrument, blind to
# which engine it times, forked around each rep and read via wait4()'s rusage.  self(ms)/cv_pct/
# maxmin/min_detectable_pct (columns 1-8) are UNCHANGED -- still each engine's own TIME() self-report,
# kept for continuity and still what test_bench_snobol4_timed.sh's live board reads for m3/sbl output,
# but per the s200 finding SPITBOL's TIME() is CPU-time-patched and SCRIP's is wall-clock, so the two
# were never the same unit -- self(ms) is NEVER AGAIN the cross-engine authority.  New columns 9-17
# add: used/contaminated/nivcsw_max (a rep whose nivcsw exceeds $BENCH_NIVCSW_THRESHOLD, default 20,
# is EXCLUDED from every mean below, not averaged in -- the mechanical cure for the 47.9% floor), then
# elapsed (CLOCK_MONOTONIC, external) and cpu (external user+sys) mean/cv/min_detectable triples.  CPU
# is the new cross-engine authority; ELAPSED is reported alongside so the two min_detectable_pct
# columns can be read BY NAME side by side -- CPU should read tighter under load since a descheduled
# millisecond counts against elapsed but not against cpu.
