# test_gate_pl_rung11_lco.sh -- RUNG 11 LANDING GATE (LCO / last-call optimisation, ARCH-PROLOG-BYRD-BOX-TRANSLATION.md
# sec B.18; task prolog-rung-11-last-call-optimisation-lco). This is the task's own DONE-WHEN, minted as a script rather
# than a one-line bash -c: the sec B.18 depth criterion needs two witness programs and an RSS comparison, which does not
# fit legibly on one line and this project's OWN convention for a multi-part criterion is a dedicated script (see
# test_gate_pl_quad_regs.sh, test_prolog_ladder.sh), not a fragile nested-quoting one-liner.
# THREE PARTS, ALL REQUIRED:
#   (1) bash scripts/test_prolog_ladder.sh --only 11   -- PASS 2/2 (m3 + m4) on the ladder's own rung-11 witness.
#   (2) bash scripts/test_gate_pl_port_trace.sh --only 11 -- the port-trace instrument (refs owed at landing, ceo 2026-09-03).
#   (3) THE DEPTH CRITERION, IN BOTH MODES -- count(N) to 10^6 under `ulimit -s 512` (vs the default 8MB, so the ceiling
#       this proves is tighter than the ladder witness's own 100000 by construction), and RSS must be FLAT across N, not
#       merely non-crashing: measured at N=1000 and N=1000000 (a 1000x range), the high-N run's max RSS must stay under
#       2x the low-N run's -- a generous bound (true O(1) LCO measures near-identical) that still catches an O(N)
#       regression (a 1000x N range would blow way past 2x if frames were still accumulating).
#       ⛔ THIS PART GRADED m3 ALONE UNTIL 2026-09-03 AND THAT WAS THE HOLE IN THIS GATE (hq_P, found by hq_C's question
#       about the rung-3 trace, not by any board). It ran `"$SCRIP" "$W/hi.pl"` -- no --compile, so mode-3 by default --
#       while parts 1 and 2 both graded m3+m4. So the ONE property this rung exists to establish, that the frame is
#       RELEASED, was proven in one mode and merely assumed in the other; a mode-4 LCO regression would have kept this
#       gate green. The cure is measured, not assumed: m4 passes the same criterion on the same witnesses (5324KB @1e3
#       vs 5176KB @1e6 under ulimit -s 512, flat), so the arm was added because it PASSES honestly, not to paper a red.
#       ⭐ THE SHAPE IS WORTH MORE THAN THE FIX: a multi-part gate whose parts disagree about their own population is the
#       false-green trap wearing a passing suite -- parts 1 and 2 said "m3 + m4" in this very header, and part 3 said
#       nothing, so the header read as if all three covered both. State each part's population IN the part.
# EXIT: 0 all three parts pass · 1 any part fails · 2 UNPROVEN (cannot measure: no scrip binary, a witness would not write).
# AUTHORSHIP: drafted by seat05 while it held this row, saved outside the root and never pushed when the ceo released
# the row (a fleet seat never touches a rung); adopted here unchanged in substance by hq_P, which owns the row, after
# proving it FAILS ONCE -- part 3's RSS bound was checked to reject an O(N) stack by running the high-N witness with a
# deliberately un-flat control. A DONE-WHEN nobody has seen fail is not an acceptance test.
