# SPITBOL'S RULE (measured with sbl -bf; ceo CEO-1419 ticket snobol4-the-f0-file-option-is-ignored-so-a-read-of-
# standard-input-never-fails, found by Lon's infinite_snobol4, whose first run filled 839 MB in four minutes):
# INPUT(.v, 5, '[-f0 ...]') associates v with channel 5 on file descriptor 0, so v reads standard input's lines and
# FAILS at end of file; '-l<n>' caps each line at n characters, keeping line boundaries. SCRIP ignored the
# association when no file name preceded the brackets: it rebound the INPUT variable itself, so v kept its null value
# and a read loop never ended. It also ignored -l.
# THE CURE (core.c _INPUT_ and _io_parse_opts): with a channel and -f<fd> and no file name, the variable is
# associated with that channel on fdopen(dup(fd)), as OUTPUT's empty-name branch already did for -f1. '-l<n>' rides
# the record length as -n, which both line readers apply as a cap and the raw reader (-r, rlen > 0) never sees.
# Expectations are cut from sbl -bf AT RUN TIME, both modes. rc=0 clean · rc=1 a divergence · rc=2 REFUSAL.
