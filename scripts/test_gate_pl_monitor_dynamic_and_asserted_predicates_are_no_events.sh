# test_gate_pl_monitor_dynamic_and_asserted_predicates_are_no_events.sh -- THE PROLOG PLUG IS SILENT FOR A PREDICATE THE PROGRAM DECLARES DYNAMIC OR
# CREATES BY ASSERT (ceo CEO-1269, MONITOR-BINARY-DESIGN.md, the Prolog reading of the contract: no CALL, no STMT inside its clauses, no RETURN, on
# every side; gpx and swx already hold it). hq_prolog 2026-09-25, CEO-1266/1270; the cure is lower_prolog.c pl_pred_graph, whose silence test
# for prelude (library) predicates now also asks pl_db_owned -- declared dynamic, or given a database slot with no clause in the file.
# THE BRACKET IT CURES: sync_step_prolog_4.pl against gpx agreed to step 34 (LABEL stno=12) and diverged at step 35, scr firing
# CALL counter/1 for the dynamic counter/1 where gpx fires nothing. With the plug silent the witness agrees to its end (AGREE=44 DIVERGE=0).
# ARMS: 1 (no oracle) the trace names the static st/1 and NEITHER the dynamic counter/1, NOR the asserted made/1,
#       NOR a meta-called ==/2 (a built-in's compiled meta-call wrapper is library code: the second half of CEO-1269, bracketed on Logtalk
#       logical_update_semantics_clause_retract at step 117, scr firing CALL ==/2 for the case's (Assertion) goal) -- st/1 is the control against
#       a plug that went silent for everything. (A program may not redefine a built-in under gprolog -- gplc refuses append/3 -- so no oracle
#       arbitrates a same-named program predicate; the silence test still keeps one the file defines, via !pl_file_defines.)
#       2 (gpx) monitor_run.sh on sync_step_prolog_4.pl reads AGREE with DIVERGE=0; a missing gpx REFUSES rc=2, never a pass.
# RED BEFORE on origin ccbe115b5: ARM 1 names counter/1 and made/1 (and L212 inside made/1); ARM 2 DIVERGE at step 35.
