# test_gate_gc_blob_carve_invariant_is_named_and_held.sh -- the R-4(b) SNOBOL4 stored-pattern blob frame
# (emit.cpp, "R-4(b) BLOB ACTIVATION FRAME") and the deferred-capture pump that re-enters emitted code at a
# match's end. Row gc-the-blob-frame-interior-takes-one-static-layout-and-its-cross-frame-dependency-is-named
# (cto, 2026-09-19); the earlier criterion (CEO-829 on CEO-824(2)) is superseded by measurement, recorded below.
#
# WHAT THIS GATE USED TO HOLD, AND WHY IT INVERTED. Until 2026-09-19 the carve was a DEPTH CONTRACT: growing it
# by 16, 32 or 48 bytes killed user_function_eval_pos_replace_branch_1 in mode 3 with the emitted program otherwise
# byte-identical, and this gate PLANTED that perturbation and required it to kill. The dependency was then NAMED
# (baton ledger of the row above, GOAL-CTO CTO-83): the match-end box called rt_match_end_all, a C pump that
# CALLED BACK into emitted code (rt_dcap_pump -> rt_sno_dtx_value -> rt_call_proc_descr -> rt_proc_enter) through
# five C frames, so a DEFINE'd function's statements reached that way ran at a depth the emitter never laid out, and its rsp-relative
# frame slots (op_zdepth 0, main-frame offsets) landed wherever the C frames' sizes put them -- on a dead slot when
# green, on the outer match's saved r12 when a -fstack-protector canary made the C frames 80 bytes deeper. The
# carve perturbation moved the same block by the same bytes. That is the whole "depth contract".
#
# LON, 2026-09-19, in-chat, verbatim: "It is disallowed to enter a BB via a C function except the very FIRST one
# inside the SCRIP, the ORIGINAL program invocation." and "If a C function must be called, then it must return the
# data needed for the BB to perform the direct jump, i.e. the C function must return before the BB is jumped into."
# THE CURE: rt_match_end_all is deleted; the match-end box calls rt_dcap_end_ok_open, which RETURNS the entry
# address of the next deferred capture target (0 = done, 1 = strict refuse), the box enters it with its own
# gamma/omega wires exactly as rt_proc_enter did, and rt_dcap_land_gamma/omega finish the capture and return the
# next target. No C frame sits between the match-end box and the body any more.
#
# THE INVARIANT NOW: (1) WITNESS -- user_function_eval_pos_replace_branch_1 matches its ref in both modes.
# (2) THE CARVE IS A SIZE, NOT A DEPTH -- the SAME perturbation that used to kill (+16, +32, +48 bytes,
# SCRIP_BLOB_CARVE_PAD) runs CLEAN and matches the ref in mode 3. A red here means a C frame is back between an
# emitted box and an emitted body, or the body-slot regime moved. (3) CARVE-ONLY -- the perturbed program differs
# from the base only in `sub rsp` immediates, so arm 2 grades the carve and nothing else. (4) THE PUMP SHAPE --
# the emitted match-end of the witness carries `call rt_dcap_end_ok_open`, `call rt_dcap_land_γ` and
# `call rt_dcap_land_ω`, and carries NO `rt_match_end_all`; the checker is proven on a doctored copy of the same
# emission that reintroduces the old symbol and drops the landings, which must FAIL it.
#
# THE FAIL-ONCE THIS GATE CANNOT REPLAY (it needs a runtime rebuild): `git show 0a6f75394:src/ir/descr.h` (a char
# array member in DESCR_t, canaries on) took the witness to SIGSEGV in both modes before the cure and reads green
# in both after it -- measured 2026-09-19, recorded in the row's ledger and CTO-83.
