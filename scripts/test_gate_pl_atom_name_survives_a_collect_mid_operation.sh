# prolog-atom-names-live-in-71-c-locals-that-no-root-scan-sees-so-deleting-pinning-dangles-every-one; cto ruling
# 2026-09-14 on the cure and on what this gate grades; census by hq_V).
#
# ✅ BOTH CLAUSES ARE GREEN AND THIS GATE IS WIRED BLOCKING (hq_prolog 2026-09-20). It spent three days at
# 2 of 3 with clause 2 red for a reason that was never this row's, and the ruling in gate_wiring.tsv said in
# writing to wire it in the landing that cleared that crash. That crash is cleared, so this is that landing.
# Clause 1 grades the PRECONDITION the cto ruled: atom-name storage is OUTSIDE the collected heap. The cto ruled
# option one (storage leaves the heap) over option two (re-read through prolog_atom_name after every point that
# can collect) because option two is a property at 56 call sites that nothing but the next author's memory can
# hold: a claim spanning two sites can be held by a check, a claim spanning fifty-six cannot be held at all.
#
# ⛔⭐ WHAT CLEARED CLAUSE 2, AND IT WAS NOT THIS ROW. Clause 2 grades 20 runs per mode under SCRIP_GC_STRESS=1,
# and that used to trip a SIGSEGV with nothing to do with atom names: the collection point walked g_call_args and
# handed the visitor a word that was not a DESCR. Row prolog-twelve-master-entries-sigsegv-under-gc-stress-in-the-
# call-args-root-walk owned it. It was cured by SCRIP cda82fa66 (cto, CTO-90) -- the DT_N slen==1/slen==2 heap-block
# checks in gc_visit_one -- which is the walker-side exclusion this seat built, measured at 20/20 -> 0/20, and
# REFUSED TO LAND because on that tree a DT_N slen==1 frame reference was the only root reaching that cell whenever
# the pz fast path skipped the machine-stack walk. ⭐ THE REFUSAL WAS RIGHT AND WAS NOT ANSWERED -- it was DISSOLVED
# by SCRIP c6bf8e789, THE E SWITCH, which deleted cons_stack, pz and the seam sweep so gc_collect_ex now calls
# gc_stack_segments unconditionally and the excluded cell is always reached by the stack walk itself. The lesson is
# the schedule's, not the bug's: a blocked row should re-run its DONE-WHEN before re-reading its own analysis,
# because "has my question been answered" and "is my question still the question" have different answers.
#
# ⭐ THE ATTRIBUTION THAT KEPT THE TWO DEFECTS APART WAS MEASURED, NOT INFERRED FROM THE SHAPE: the atom-name cure
# left the crash rate UNCHANGED (queens 20/20 before and after, this witness 4/30 before and 3/30 after -- noise,
# and deliberately not read as an improvement). Two defects that looked alike at the surface were two classes.
#
# ⛔⭐ WHY CLAUSE 2 CANNOT BE THE LEVER, AND THIS IS THE PART WORTH READING. The collector is a SLIDING compactor:
# gc_heap.c memmoves live blocks down and DOES NOT overwrite what it vacates. So a pointer left behind by a move
# keeps reading the OLD BYTES, which are still the correct string until something else is allocated over them. A
# dangling atom-name read therefore returns a PLAUSIBLE answer, and an output comparison -- any number of runs of
# it -- cannot tell that class from a correct one. SCRIP_GC_POISON exists for exactly this: it fills the vacated
# tail with 0xDB after the slide, so a stale pointer into freed space reads garbage instead of the truth.
#
# ⛔ THE POSITIVE CONTROL IS MANDATORY AND A DEAD SWITCH REFUSES rc=2. This row's own history is the reason: its
# first witness was self-identical in every collector configuration with moved=0B everywhere -- a switch that was
# not on, reading exactly like a clean result. Before grading anything this gate asserts, from [ZGC-WALK] and
# [ZGC-POISON] under SCRIP_ZETA_TELEM=1, that blocks really moved AND that vacated space really was filled.
#
# ⛔ THE REF IS CUT FROM swipl AT RUN TIME, NEVER FROM OUR OWN OUTPUT (CEO-753). No swipl, no grade: rc=2.
#
# ⛔ WHAT THE POISON DOES NOT COVER, so the next seat does not over-trust a green: it fills the vacated TAIL only.
# A block that slid DOWN leaves its old address inside the still-live region, where other slid data now sits, so a
# stale pointer there still reads plausible bytes. Poison catches the tail class; it does not catch that one.
# ⭐⛔ --quick RUNS 2 ITERATIONS PER MODE INSTEAD OF 20, AND THE NUMBER IS MEASURED RATHER THAN CHOSEN.
# FAIL-ONCE STUDY, hq_prolog 2026-09-20, on a build with THIS ROW'S CURE REVERTED (prolog_atom.c taking atom-name
# storage back onto the collected heap via rt_heap_strdup_c): the gate goes RED at ITERS=1 -- 1 of 1 runs diverged,
# in BOTH modes, at ITERS=1, 2 and 4 alike. DETECTION IS DETERMINISTIC, NOT PROBABILISTIC.
# ⭐ WHY IT IS DETERMINISTIC NOW WHEN THE 20-RUN DESIGN ASSUMED IT WAS NOT: the 20 runs were specified BEFORE
# SCRIP_GC_POISON existed, when a dangling atom-name read returned the OLD BYTES -- still the correct string until
# something allocated over them -- so only repetition plus luck could catch it. Poison fills the vacated tail with
# 0xDB, so the stale read is GARBAGE on the first run. The poison knob did not make the gate faster; it made the
# REPETITION REDUNDANT, and nobody had gone back to re-derive the iteration count after landing it.
# ⛔ THE COST IS PAID BY THE GREEN RUNS, NOT BY DETECTION: a CORRECT run under SCRIP_GC_STRESS=1 costs ~19.4s, a
# diverging one fails fast (the whole mutated study at ITERS=1/2/4 took 2s, 1s and 2s). So ITERS is almost pure
# cost on a healthy tree and almost no detection value past the first run.
# ⛔ 2 AND NOT 1, DELIBERATELY: one run has no margin at all, and this gate's own history is a witness that ran
# green in every configuration because its switch was dead. Two runs keep a second observation of the positive
# control. ⛔ MEASURED, AND MY OWN EXTRAPOLATION WAS WRONG: I predicted ~80s from 19.4s per run and a ~2s fixed
# cost; --quick actually measures 102/91/92s over three runs at load, so the fixed cost (swipl ref cut, m4 build,
# the telemetry run of the positive control) is ~13s and not ~2s. At ~95s this becomes the joint most expensive
# arm of the blocking set, whose current maximum is 90s -- 1.06x that maximum, against 8.6x for the 778s form.
# ⛔ THE FULL 20-ITERATION FORM IS STILL THE DEFAULT for a hand run and for a collector landing -- pass no flag.
# EXIT: 0 both clauses pass · 1 the precondition is red or a run diverged from the oracle · 2 REFUSED to grade.
# ✅ WIRED BLOCKING in make test / test-sequential as of 2026-09-20. The gate_wiring.tsv RULING that held it
# out EXPIRED WITH ITS NAMED ROW, exactly as that ruling said it would, and the row is closed.
