# SPITBOL'S RULES (sbl.min, read by the cfo 2026-10-02 for ceo CEO-1419's ticket snobol4-real-to-string-differs-in-the-last-digit-
# and-a-real-in-a-match-loses-its-trailing-point; x64 sbl builds without .cncr, so its own code runs, never syscr):
#   REAL TO STRING, gts10-gts28: scale the magnitude into [0.1, 1.0) by steps of 10**10 and a powers-of-ten table, ADD the rounding
#   bias 0.5*10**-15, rescale once if that reached 1.0, multiply by 10**15 and TRUNCATE (cvttsd2si). That is not C's correctly
#   rounded "%.14e": 1.1 / 1.5 is 0.733333333333334 in sbl, and was 0.733333333333333 in SCRIP. The form rules were already SCRIP's
#   (an exponent below 0 or above 15 gives 0.ddde-N / 0.ddde+N, trailing fractional zeros go, a whole value keeps its point).
#   EXPONENTIATION, o_exp: a real exponent is e ** (exponent * ln(base)) through libm's log and exp (osint math.c f_lnf, f_etx),
#   not pow(), with a negative base allowed only at an integral exponent (else 311) and the sign set by its parity; a real base to
#   a non-negative integer power is the base multiplied in sequence (oex14), not squaring; a negative integer exponent becomes a
#   real one. 0 ** 0 and 0.0 ** 0.0 are 018, an overflow is 266.
#   A REAL IN A MATCH OR AS A STRING: every conversion is gtstg's, so a real pattern is '0.' and '2.', SIZE(2.5) is 3, and a TRACE
#   line spells the value the same way. So is a real BUILT INTO A PATTERN at run time: an alternation or concatenation arm, ARBNO,
#   FENCE, a stored or an EVAL'd pattern -- (0.0 | 'q') fails on '0' and its capture reads 0.
# WHAT SCRIP DID BEFORE: real_str rounded by "%.14e" (6125 of this gate's 174,600-line sweep differed, measured on the parent);
# rt_sno_pow used pow() and squaring (6050 of 19,200 differed); a deferred real pattern converted by "%g" ('0' ? R matched, sbl
# fails); bn_size returned 0 for every real; the trace voice spelled a real by "%g" (F(3) where sbl prints F(3.)). A real built into
# a pattern at run time (pattern_match.c rcp_of, under SNO$PBALT, pat_cat, ARBNO, FENCE and every EVAL) converted by gcvt, so
# '0' ? (0.0 | 'q') matched (ceo's row snobol4-a-whole-number-real-as-an-alternation-arm-converts-without-its-point, from Lon's
# infinite_snobol4 demo): the build arm read 13 of its 18 lines differing on the parent c59242660, both modes, and 0 on the cure.
# NOT COVERED: a subnormal result, which sbl zeroes through its MXCSR underflow test on every real operation (0. both sides here
# only by the conversion's own scaling), and Pascal's real writer, which has its own formatter and its own row.
#
# Expectations are cut from sbl -bf AT RUN TIME, both modes; every arm grades its whole stdout. The sweeps compute every value at
# run time, because sbl folds a constant expression at compile time. rc=0 clean · rc=1 a divergence · rc=2 REFUSAL.
