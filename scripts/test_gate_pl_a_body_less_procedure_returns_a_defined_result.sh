# HAND ITS CALLER THE FRAME-MAP ADDRESS AS ITS RESULT (hq_prolog 2026-09-23, CEO-1215; cto-approved cure).
# ⛔⭐ THE DEFECT, MEASURED WITH GDB: emit_gc_map_cell (emit.cpp) loads the activation frame's map with
# `lea rax, [rip + .Lgcmap_<fam>]` and used to leave rax holding it. A body of IR_SUCCEED alone never writes the
# result register, so gamma forwarded that address as the call's result, and the Prolog det call site tests its low
# byte against DT_FAIL (104). An address ending in 0x68 turned a SUCCESS into a FAILURE: the Logtalk grader's
# `'$lgt_cond' :- true.` read "condition false" and ten clause_2 cases plus three assertz_1 cases went UNGRADED in
# mode 4 only. ⭐ LAYOUT-DEPENDENT, which is why the monitor agreed: the same .s linked as PIE, or built traced,
# moves the map labels off the fatal byte. The cure is `mov eax, 0` at the end of emit_gc_map_cell -- the null
# descriptor, a success at every det call site, deterministically.
# THREE ARMS, BOTH MODES. (A) a generated witness: 256 body-less procedures, each called through catch/3 from a det
# site, printing bad(K) for any that reads as failure -- measured before the cure, m4 linked -no-pie: bad(80)
# bad(111) bad(210). (B) the Logtalk clause_2 case program itself (iso_clause_2_01, built by util_logtalk_grade's
# own planner so it tracks the grader), the witness the ceo's row named. (C) STRUCTURAL, LAYOUT-FREE: in every
# witness's mode-4 .s, each frame-map load is followed by `mov eax, 0` before the next instruction that could read
# rax. A behavioural witness is only red when a map address happens to end in 0x68; (C) is red on ANY layout when the
# cure is missing, and its canary proves it can say no.
# ⛔ REFS ARE CUT FROM swipl AT RUN TIME, never from our output (CEO-753); no swipl -> REFUSE rc=2.
# ⛔ mode 4 is linked -no-pie, as every suite grader links it; a PIE link hides the behavioural half.
# EXIT: 0 clean · 1 a violation · 2 UNPROVEN (no binary, no oracle, no witness compiled, a canary not red).
