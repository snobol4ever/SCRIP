# test_gate_gc_pas_heap_cells_survive_forced_movement.sh -- row pascal-gc-the-pas-heap-cell-table-holds-collected-heap-strings-and-the-collector-never-visits-it
# (minted ceo 2026-09-20 CEO-mint; PREMISE MEASURED FALSE AND THE ROW REWRITTEN BY hq_pascal THE SAME DAY -- see THE PREMISE below).
# THE MECHANISM, read out of the code rather than recalled: new(p) is rewritten by the parser (pascal.y) into __pas_alloc_rec(nfields); the runtime arm
# (by_name_dispatch.c) does TWO allocations -- pas_heap_take() returns an INTEGER INDEX and pas_heap_cell(n,1) hands back a DESCR_t slot in the Pascal-private
# side table g_pas_heap, while the record's fields are built as an SOH-separated string by rt_str_alloc, which IS rt_gcheap_alloc(DT_S) on the COLLECTED,
# SLIDING heap.  So a Pascal pointer VALUE is an integer handle and every record's field payload is a collected heap string held by that side table.
# ⛔⭐ THE PREMISE THE ROW WAS MINTED ON IS FALSE ON THIS TREE AND WAS ALREADY FALSE WHEN IT WAS MINTED.  The row says gc_heap.c contains ZERO references to
# pas_heap, which is literally true and is not the question: the collector reaches the table through a function named pas_gc_roots, NOT through the string
# pas_heap.  pas_gc_roots is defined in by_name_dispatch.c, walks g_pas_heap[1..top] with rt_gc_visit_descr plus the g_pas_tf text-file buffers, is a strong
# global symbol (nm reads T pas_gc_roots; there is no weak fallback), and is called UNCONDITIONALLY in the root phase of gc_heap.c beside core_gc_roots and
# pl_gc_roots.  It landed 2026-09-13 in f0d0adf5b (subject: the heap table is a movable root the collector walks) and was hardened the same day by bcf75511a
# (subject: the collector's Pascal root hook is a strong symbol) -- SEVEN DAYS BEFORE THE ROW WAS MINTED.  ⭐ A grep for pas_heap inside gc_heap.c answers
# "is the string there", not "does the collector visit the table", and the visiting function does not carry the string.  This gate exists so that the answer
# is MEASURED on every run instead of re-derived from a grep by the next seat who asks.
# ⛔ BEING CALLED IS NOT BEING CORRECT, which is why this gate forces movement rather than hoping for it.  Under a sliding collector a root that is VISITED
# but not FORWARDED is still corruption, and a null result bounds the probe rather than the thing probed (the ceo's own honest half of the mint).  So:
#   SCRIP_GC_STRESS=N   forces a collection every Nth allocation -- UNSET IS ZERO FORCED COLLECTIONS, which is why ARM 1 exists.
#   SCRIP_GC_PLANT_SHIFT forces a deterministic shift every collection, so live blocks MOVE even when they would otherwise stay put.
#   SCRIP_GC_POISON is ON BY DEFAULT (gc_heap.c) and fills vacated space with 0xDB, so an unforwarded cell reads garbage rather than stale-but-plausible bytes.
# ⛔⭐ ARM 1 IS THE ONE THIS GATE EXISTS FOR AND IT IS hq_snocone's, CREDITED (2026-09-20, their snocone GC row, same mechanism in their lane): "THE MASTER IS
# CLEAN AT ONE MEGABYTE" CAN BE TRUE AND MEAN NOTHING.  Measured in the Pascal lane the same day: all 246 Pascal master entries at SCRIP_HEAP_MB=1 with NO
# stress read PASS=246 FAIL=0 with collectors=0 non_collectors=246 regenerations=0 -- a perfect green over a population that never ran a collector once.  No rc,
# no denominator and no FAIL=0 anywhere in a pass/fail instrument can say so.  THEREFORE the liveness question is asked SEPARATELY, FIRST, and AT EVERY BAND
# POINT (a HIGHER plant collects LESS often, so a high point can be inert for the same reason the tiny arena was), and a point that did not collect REFUSES
# rc=2 rather than reporting green.
# ⛔ WHAT THIS GATE DOES NOT PROVE, said plainly so a green is not over-read: the witnesses are hand-cut record shapes (a record with integer fields and a
# packed array field; a linked list threaded through pointer fields), NOT the Pascal master.  A green here is a statement about those shapes at those band
# points at THIS path length, and per hq_raku 2026-09-20 a stress band is a property of (program, runner, PATH LENGTH) -- the argv string is allocated and the
# stress plant counts allocations, so the pathname decides which allocation a collection lands on.  The path length is printed on the first line for that reason.
# Whatever a band finds is a LOWER BOUND, never a population (hq_prolog 2026-09-20: their window is ragged and non-monotonic, wrong at 1,2,3,5,10,25 and right
# at 0,20,40,50 -- a sample of {20,40,50} would have called it clean).
