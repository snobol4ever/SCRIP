# test_gate_gc_a_nested_match_restores_a_moved_outer_subject.sh -- A COLLECTION INSIDE A NESTED PATTERN MATCH NEVER LEAVES THE
# OUTER MATCH ON A MOVED SUBJECT (row gc-a-nested-match-restores-its-callers-subject-from-a-raw-pushed-register-so-a-collection-
# inside-it-leaves-the-outer-match-on-a-moved-subject; found by hq_snocone 2026-09-25 on the parser census, 322 of 944 SNOBOL4 corpus
# sources crashing parser_snobol4; cured by the cfo, CEO-1270).
#
# THE DEFECT: bb_match_begin saves its caller's match registers with push r12..r15 as RAW words -- r13, the outer subject base, at
# rbp-16 -- and rt_match_enter overwrites the rooted global Σ with the inner subject. A collection INSIDE the nested match (a deferred
# *f(x) whose function allocates) moves the outer subject; nothing visits the pushed r13; the nested match's exit (bb_match_begin's
# omega, bb_match_end's release) handed that stale word to rt_match_ctx_restore, which stored it in Σ, and reloaded r13 from it.
# THE CURE (the frozen design, CEO-812: a saved subject is a word the collector visits, never a conservative scan, never a pin):
# rt_match_enter records the outer Σ in a rooted runtime record keyed by the match frame's rbp (gen_runtime.c rt_mctx_push;
# gen_gc_roots visits every record's subject); rt_match_ctx_restore restores Σ from that record -- and hands the fresh address back
# for r13 -- when the word the frame pushed is the subject it recorded, and exactly as before (the pushed word) when it is not; records
# of frames a non-local exit abandoned are discarded by frame address.
#
# ARM 1 (the row's DONE-WHEN): hq_snocone's 17-line witness in mode 3 and mode 4 at SCRIP_GC_STRESS 1 2 5 20 100 prints what
# sbl -bf prints. The 200000-byte dead block below the subject is what makes the collection move the outer subject far enough to land
# on a quarantined page; without it the stale read lands on the subject's own shifted bytes and passes silently.
# ARM 2 (the arm cannot pass vacuously): at SCRIP_GC_STRESS=5 the mode-3 run reports at least one collection (SCRIP_GC_EXERCISE=1).
# FAIL-ONCE: SCRIP_BIN may name another tree's scrip (its out/ is used for mode 4). On the parent of the cure (origin 40df9b119) arm 1
# reads RED at stress 5, 20 and 100 in mode 3 and at 5 in mode 4 ([ZGC-STALE] SIGSEGV).
# rc 0 GREEN · 1 RED (named) · 2 REFUSE (cannot measure).
