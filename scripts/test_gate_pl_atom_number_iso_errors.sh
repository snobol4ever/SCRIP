# test_gate_pl_atom_number_iso_errors.sh — the atom/number conversion builtins must RAISE the ISO error, not fail
# and not succeed (row prolog-atom-number-conversion-builtins-do-not-validate-arguments-so-iso-errors-never-fire,
# hq_R 2026-09-05, approved by the ceo as HQ-RESOLVE's first cure row).
#
# WHAT THIS PINS. ISO/IEC 13211-1 § 8.16 (atom_length, atom_concat, sub_atom, atom_chars, atom_codes, char_code,
# number_chars, number_codes) says each of these raises on an unbound or wrongly-typed argument. SCRIP validated
# nothing: the INRIA census (hq_R, SCRIP bba73d438, board 279/445 outcome-class) found 37 witnesses in ONE shape --
# want instantiation_error/type_error/representation_error/syntax_error, got a bare failure or a bare success.
#
# ⛔⭐ WHY THIS GATE EXISTS BESIDE test_prolog_inria_suite.sh RATHER THAN INSIDE IT. The vendor board is 445 goals
# and ~40s and moves whenever ANY lane lands anything; it answers "what is the conformance number". This answers
# "did MY class regress", in under a second, over a population that cannot drift under me. A floor gate whose
# witnesses are explicit is the point -- reading it tells you exactly what is promised, which a fraction never does.
#
# ⛔ THE WITNESSES ARE NOT TRANSCRIBED BY HAND. They were extracted mechanically from the vendored suite
# (corpus/packages/prolog/inriasuite/{atom_chars,atom_codes,atom_concat,atom_length,char_code,number_chars,
# number_codes,sub_atom}) by anchoring on the TAIL of each entry -- the expected term -- rather than splitting the
# entry at a depth-0 comma. That is deliberate: the suite's 0'c character literals (0'[ , 0'] , 0'' ) break a naive
# depth scanner, which is why the vendor runner carries a _mask_0c_lits pass. Anchoring on the tail sidesteps the
# class instead of re-implementing the mask. The extraction was CROSS-CHECKED against the vendor runner's own red
# list and agrees family-by-family; that agreement, not the extractor, is the evidence.
#
# ⛔ ONE SUITE ENTRY IS DELIBERATELY EXCLUDED and it is named here rather than dropped silently:
#     [(atom_chars(X,['1','2']), Y is X + 1), type_error(evaluable, '12'/0)]
# Its error comes from is/2, not from atom_chars/2, and arithmetic errors in this engine escape catch/3 entirely
# (measured: `catch((X is foo, write(X)), E, ...)` prints "Warning: goal raised exception" and never enters the
# recovery goal). It belongs to the arithmetic-errors-escape-catch3 row, not to this one. Curing THIS row must not
# be graded on a defect it does not own -- and that row's cure will not close this gate either, which is the honest
# split. Population here is therefore 37, and the script prints that denominator.
