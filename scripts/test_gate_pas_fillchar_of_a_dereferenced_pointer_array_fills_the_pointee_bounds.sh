# test_gate_pas_fillchar_of_a_dereferenced_pointer_array_fills_the_pointee_bounds.sh -- fillchar(p^, n, v) where p^ is a
# dereferenced pointer to a declared array type now fills every element of the POINTEE's own declared bounds (low..high read
# from the pointee's array TYPE, via pas_ptrexpr_target/pas_arrtype_high/pas_arrtype_lo), the same loop-lowering the named
# array-variable case already used.
#
# MEASURED 2026-10-01 by hq_pascal, row pascal-every-suite-to-100-under-nonet-ceo-1266. monitor_run.sh --oracle on
# corpus/packages/pascal/fpc_tests/test_opt_treg3.pas bracketed the divergence at step 5 (stno 16): fpx continues past
# `fillchar(p^, 101*sizeof(longint), 0)` to stno 17, scr ENDs right there. Root cause, src/parsers/pascal/pascal.y's fillchar
# lowering only recognized a destination that is a bare TT_VAR naming an array variable (pas_array_high_get keyed on the
# VARIABLE's name); `p^` lowers to a TT_FNC __pas_deref(p) node, which matched nothing, so the call fell through to an ordinary
# (undefined) routine call and bombed at runtime. Cure: when the destination is __pas_deref(ptr), resolve the pointee's
# declared TYPE name via pas_ptrexpr_target(ptr), look up that TYPE's own bounds via pas_arrtype_high/pas_arrtype_lo (not the
# per-variable table, which a pointer target never populates), and build the same per-element assignment loop indexing through
# a fresh __pas_deref(clone-of-ptr) rather than a bare variable leaf. The pre-existing named-array-variable path is untouched.
#
# ARMS, both modes, each program's expected stdout and exit code cut LIVE from fpc -Miso: (1) parr -- a pointer to array[0..4]
# of longint, filled to zero, two elements overwritten nonzero, re-filled to zero, all five read back; FAILS on parent (fillchar
# through the pointer never lowers, the undefined-routine call bombs). (2) lowb -- a pointer to array[5..8] of longint (a
# NONZERO low bound, pinning pas_arrtype_lo and not just pas_arrtype_high), same mutate/re-zero/read-back shape read at its own
# 5..8 indices; FAILS on parent, same cause. (3) named -- a plain named array variable (the pre-existing path, unchanged by this
# cure), filled to zero after being populated nonzero; already right on parent and stays right, pinning no regression.
# FAIL_ONCE=1 corrupts arm 3's ref.
#
# NOT THIS GATE'S DEFECT, FOUND WHILE DRAFTING, LEFT OPEN: write(p^[i]) where p^[i] indexes a CHAR array through a pointer
# dereference prints the ordinal (pas_is_charexpr has no TT_IDX-over-__pas_deref arm), independent of fillchar and of this cure
# -- reproduces with plain assignment, no fillchar involved. An earlier draft of arm (2) used array[5..8] of char and tripped
# on exactly this; switched to longint to keep this gate on only the fillchar defect it was minted for.
