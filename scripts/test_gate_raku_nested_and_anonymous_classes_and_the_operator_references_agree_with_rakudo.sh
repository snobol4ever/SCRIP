# test_gate_raku_nested_and_anonymous_classes_and_the_operator_references_agree_with_rakudo.sh -- A CLASS OR ROLE DECLARED BELOW THE TOP LEVEL (in a block, a sub, an if, a for, a do, another class), AN ANONYMOUS CLASS, AND THE OPERATOR REFERENCES &[+] / &infix:<cmp> / &prefix:<->
# (row raku-every-suite-to-100-under-nonet-ceo-1266; found by classifying the 530 Roast files that do not compile: 31 die "assignment to 'x' has an rhs shape with no native arm", 5 of them on `my $*OUT = class { ... }`; operator references are used by 80 Roast files, anonymous classes by 21).
#
# THE DEFECTS, each measured against Rakudo: (1) the lowerer discovered classes and roles only among the PROGRAM'S OWN TOP-LEVEL STATEMENTS, so `{ class Foo { method m { 42 } }; say Foo.new.m }` printed NOTHING (the whole block silently did nothing), and so for a class declared in an if, a for, a do, a sub or another class's method -- the way Roast
# files wrap each test; (2) an anonymous class `my $c = class { ... }`, `anon class`, `class :: is P`, `(class { ... }).new` died "rhs shape with no native arm" or BOMB "bb_call marshal"; (3) `.new` on a variable holding a class (`my $c = Foo; $c.new`) did nothing, for a named class too;
# (4) an operator reference is a variable named with the source text (&[+], &infix:<cmp>): `reduce(&[+], 1,2,3)` printed nothing, `(3,1,2).sort(&infix:<cmp>)` printed ((<cmp>) 1 2 3), `&infix:<*>(3,4)` died "procedure '(<*>)' has no stackless slab", `my $f = &[+]` was refused by the native emitter.
# THE CURE: (lower_raku.c rk_hoist_nested_types, the first pass of rk_stage2_core) every class or role below the top level moves to the program's top level and is replaced by a type reference (a statement position becomes an empty sequence); an anonymous one gets a generated letters-only name (a name
# with an underscore and digits breaks the method machinery's `self`), and a name already in use (a `my class` repeated in two blocks, or a built-in type's name) gets a fresh one, with the references in its enclosing scope renamed; (by_name_dispatch.c meth_call) `new` on a string that names a user class constructs through obj_new, and a type object's name is read through
# rk_typeobj_name; (rk_tree.c rk_opref, in rkb_var) &[OP], &infix:<OP>, &infix:«OP», &prefix:<OP> become a two-placeholder closure built through the same operator tables as the hyper and reduce forms; the Z[&infix:<+>] bracket form resolves the same way.
# NOT HERE (own rows): a user class's type object as a VALUE is still the string "Foo" (`say Foo` prints Foo where Rakudo prints (Foo), `Foo ?? 1 !! 0` is true); a hoisted class does not see the enclosing block's lexical variables; the display name of a renamed duplicate shows the generated suffix in .WHAT.gist; `unique(:with(&infix:<==>))` and the other named comparator
# arguments; .produce / .classify / .minmax; `sort(&[>])` with a Bool-returning comparator; an operator reference to a user-declared operator sub; `&[..]`.
#
# THE WITNESS, graded in m3 (--run) and m4 (--compile + link) against a ref cut by Rakudo (/usr/bin/raku), then under SCRIP_GC_STRESS 1 3 5 in both modes.
# FAILED ONCE, measured on SCRIP 634e9d9cb before the cure: every witness-mode pair red.
#
# EXIT: 0 every witness matches in both modes; 1 a mismatch or a crash on a witness; 2 REFUSED (stale binary, no gcc).
