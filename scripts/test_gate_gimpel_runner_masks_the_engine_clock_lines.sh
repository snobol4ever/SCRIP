# test_gate_gimpel_runner_masks_the_engine_clock_lines.sh -- THE GIMPEL RUNNER READS THE PACKAGE'S ALL.mask BEFORE IT COMPARES (the coo
# 2026-10-02, row instruments-the-gimpel-runner-reads-all-mask-so-timer-and-timegc-grade-their-pinned-lines, ceo CEO-1412). MEASURED CAUSE:
# scorecard_snobol4.sh grade() was a plain cmp, so the CEO-409 rows corpus f2ae706da declared for gimpel's timegc_driver (the engine clock
# and the storage units COLLECT() frees) were never applied and timegc read DIFF DIFF on every pass; with the mask applied it reads PASS
# PASS (the ceo by hand, then this seat through the runner). WHAT THIS GATE HOLDS, over a scratch corpus outside corpus/ (CEO-547) holding
# timegc_driver, its two includes, its ref, its ALL.csv row and its two ALL.mask rows, graded through the runner's own `one` verb:
# (1) with the mask, PASS in both modes, and the note column counts the masked lines on both sides;
# (2) PLANTED, the same fixture with an ALL.mask that has no timegc row -- an unmasked timing difference -- reads DIFF in both modes;
# (3) FAIL-ONCE, the scorecard with grade()'s SCRIP-side mask step removed (the pre-cure compare) reads DIFF on arm 1's fixture, so arm 1
# would red on the defect this gate names. rc 2 when the oracle, the binary or a fixture file is missing.
