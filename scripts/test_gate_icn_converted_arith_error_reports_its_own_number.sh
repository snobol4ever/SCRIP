# test_gate_icn_converted_arith_error_reports_its_own_number.sh -- THE INVARIANT GATE for the &error := -1
# CONVERSION CLASS in shared arithmetic (CEO-532, hq_U 2026-09-10).  Under error conversion an arithmetic
# operation that cannot produce a value must RAISE ITS OWN error before it fails, so that &errornumber,
# &errortext and &errorvalue describe THIS operation.  The measured defect: a DT_I fast block that returns
# FAILDESCR ahead of the frame's own setjmp raises nothing at all, and the three keywords keep whatever the
# PREVIOUS error left in them -- 1 / 0 reached by-name reported 102 "numeric expected" with errorvalue "a".
#
# ⛔⭐ WHY EVERY WITNESS CARRIES A PRIMER, AND WHY THE PRIMER'S NUMBER IS DELIBERATELY NOT THE ANSWER.
# A silent failure is invisible to any gate that only reads the RESULT: the expression fails either way, so
# result-only grading calls the defect green.  It is equally invisible to a gate that runs the cases in one
# process in an order where neighbouring cases expect the SAME number -- the stale value is then the right
# value by accident.  So each witness runs ALONE, preceded by a primer error whose number (102) is not the
# answer to any case in the population.  A case that raises nothing therefore reads 102, and 102 is never
# correct here.  That is what turns "did it report a number" into "did it report ITS OWN number", which is
# the whole claim.  ⭐ THE DENOMINATOR DESCRIBES THE DEFECT SPACE, NOT THE ARMS: the population is every
# arithmetic shape whose zero divisor is reachable through a DIFFERENT dispatch route -- static (rt_div),
# dynamic (rt_num_arith via by-name invocation), integer and real -- because the defect was route-specific
# and a gate holding only the static route would have printed a full green over it (hq_T, 2026-09-10).
#
# ⛔ THE ORACLE CUTS EVERY ANSWER ON EVERY RUN -- never a stored .ref.  A .ref is a photograph of what SCRIP
# printed the day it was cut, and this class was WRONG on the day any such .ref would have been cut.
#
# ⛔ ARM B IS A MUTATION ARM AND IT IS NOT OPTIONAL.  It grades a witness that deliberately does NOT raise
# against the oracle answer for one that does, and REFUSES rc=2 if the comparator calls that agreement.  A
# criterion nobody has watched say NO is not a criterion.  ⛔ ARM C names a timeout as TIMEOUT: an rc=124
# cannot distinguish "needed one more second" from "never finishes", and a gate that grades only values
# calls a hang green.
#
# EXIT: 0 every witness agrees with the oracle in both modes · 1 any disagreement · 2 REFUSED (cannot measure).
