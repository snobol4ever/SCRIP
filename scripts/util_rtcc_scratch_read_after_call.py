"""util_rtcc_scratch_read_after_call.py -- DOES EMITTED CODE READ r8, r10 OR r11 AFTER A CALL BEFORE IT WRITES IT?

The cto's ruling ruling-retire-the-r8-r10-r11-writeback-yes-with-a-standing-reader-gate (2026-10-09), condition (1): the
write-back of r8, r10 and r11 into rtccb before a C call or a poll and their reload after it retire, and this reader
is the standing proof that nothing in emitted code reads one of them after a call before a write.  A read there would
see whatever the callee left, so after the retirement a single one is a defect, named by file and instruction.

THE WALK: from every call instruction in an emitted stream, along every control-flow path (the CFG reader of
util_gc_poll_register_liveness.py, reused), for each of r8, r10, r11 and their 32/16/8-bit names, the first
instruction that touches the register decides: a WRITE ends the path, a READ is a finding.  A contiguous rtcc reload
run right after the call is skipped and not counted as a write, because it is the thing being retired: the question is
asked of the stream as it reads without it.  A path also ends at ret, ud2, an indirect jmp, or another call (that call
is a site of its own).  A self-xor or self-sub is a write.  A 16- or 8-bit write leaves the upper bits stale and is
counted a READ, never a write.

THE LIMIT, NAMED: a later call that takes r8 as its fifth argument without writing it first is a read this reader
cannot see, because a call's arity is not in the stream.

THE ENTRY: --entry also asks the question at every global function label (where C enters emitted code), the driver's
initial load of the three registers at program entry being the other half of the ruling, condition (3).  A mode-3
slab's first byte is its entry (the driver's trampoline jumps there), so --entry grades it too.
