# ARCH-GC-COMPILE-TIME-FRAME-MAPS.md section 6.5b (cto, 2026-09-18; F6 step 4).
#
# WHAT THIS GATE HOLDS, AND THE DIAGNOSIS IT CORRECTS. F6 step 4's admission predicate was "the call's
# result is stored to a mapped frame slot before the poll" (CTO-75/76). 131 of the 210 allocating call
# sites cannot satisfy it, and the standing reading of that -- the ceo's CEO-884, and the cto's own
# bucket line in CTO-76 -- was that they are BLOCKED ON STEP 2 until the static map grows a slot vector
# naming which frame offsets are live DESCRs.
#
# ⛔ THAT DIAGNOSIS IS WRONG, AND A SLOT VECTOR WOULD NOT HAVE MOVED ONE OF THEM. The blocked sites are
# op_zres boxes: the call's result IS the box's result and it stays in rax:rdx, so it is not in the frame
# at all. A map that describes the frame perfectly still cannot see a value that never reached the frame.
# What those sites need is not a better description of the stack -- it is for the value to BE on the stack.
#
# ⛔⭐ SUPERSEDED IN PLACE 2026-09-18 BY 6.5c's RECORD FORM, AND THE REASON IS THE ceo's CEO-898. 6.5b's spill-PAIR
# put the cell INSIDE the word-swept range and relied on gc_zeta_frame to relocate it -- and gc_zeta_frame is
# exactly what F6 step 3 DELETES. The moment `conservative total` reaches 0, a cell that only the sweep visits is
# visited by NOTHING and keeps its pre-collection address through a moving collection. Five sites were on that
# footing (bb_assign_global, bb_assign_var_sub, bb_idx_get, bb_to_by, bb_rev_assign_var) and all five now take
# x86_rt_gc_poll_rec_res(), which hands the pair to the poll as its SHIELD ARRAY -- visited by rt_gc_visit_descr,
# a TYPED visit that relocates by the cell's own type field -- and RAISES the floor to the caller's own rsp so the
# cell is deliberately OUTSIDE the swept range. ⭐ THAT IS THE ARM-3 INVERSION: this gate used to prove the walker
# SWEEPS the range the cell lands in; it now proves the cell lies BELOW the floor, so the relocation arm 1
# measures cannot have come from the sweep. The cure survives the sweep's deletion by construction, which is the
# property the ceo's rank-0 row needs from this half.
#
# THE ORIGINAL MECHANISM, KEPT BECAUSE THE DIAGNOSIS IT CORRECTS IS THE POINT. x86_rt_gc_poll_res() spilled the
# rax:rdx pair as a 16-byte DESCR cell under rsp across the poll and reloads it after:
#     sub rsp,16 ; mov [rsp+0],rax ; mov [rsp+8],rdx ; call rt_gc_poll ; mov rax,[rsp+0] ; mov rdx,[rsp+8] ; add rsp,16
# gc_heap.c's precise root phase already walks [poll floor, stack top) as DESCR cells with relocation
# (gc_collect_ex, the pz && g_gc_seam_sp arm), so the spilled cell is visited and UPDATED by construction
# rather than by a new agreement. rsp stays 16-aligned across the sub, so the poll's call is ABI-correct.
#
# ⛔ WHAT THIS DOES **NOT** BUY, stated here so nobody over-reads the cure the way the block was over-read.
# It makes the RESULT visible. It does not make a poll safe "anywhere": any OTHER live collected-heap
# pointer sitting in a caller-saved register at the poll is still lost, and a callee-saved register holding
# one (section 6.5a measured r13 as that register) is still owed the SPILL RECORD of 6.5. The predicate is
# relaxed from "the result reaches a mapped slot" to "the result is in rax:rdx and nothing else live is in a
# register" -- a wider door, not an open one.
#
# THE ARMS. Arm 1 is the fail-once this cure was built against, run as a live measurement rather than cited:
# the witness prints stk=B, and printed stk= (a WRONG ANSWER, not a crash) when the same site took a bare
# x86_rt_gc_poll(). Arm 2 reads the emitted asm in mode 4 and requires the record idiom in order, because an
# emission that drops a reload is exactly the bug arm 1 catches only when a collection happens to fire. Arm 3
# is a second answer, under a forced collection on an allocating witness. ⭐ ARM 4 IS THE ONE THAT CHANGED AND
# IT IS NOW THE LOAD-BEARING ONE: it proves the cell lies BELOW the floor handed to the poll. Arm 1 measured the
# value surviving a MOVING collection; arm 4 says the word sweep cannot be what relocated it, because the sweep
# walks [floor, stack top) and the cell is not in that range -- so the relocation came through the shield array
# and rt_gc_visit_descr, a TYPED visit, and the cure therefore survives F6 step 3 deleting gc_zeta_frame. The
# planted violation lowers every floor back into the cell, which is precisely 6.5b, and all of them read RED.
# Each arm carries a PLANTED-VIOLATION check so this gate can say no (CTO-74: ten gates could not).
