# AN initialization/1 GOAL MAY CONTAIN A VARIABLE (cto 2026-09-13, found while building the witness for the
# syntax-error blast-radius row -- the witness would not run, and the reason was not the witness).
#
# `:- initialization(a(_)).` does not run, does not fail and does not report: THE COMPILER ITSELF LOOPS. In
# mode 4 it emits without terminating, 2.5 MB of assembler and still growing when killed at 60s; mode 3 wires
# the same lowering in process and hangs the same way, so the program never starts. The same goal with a
# GROUND argument (`a(1)`) compiles and runs, and the same goal hoisted into a named predicate
# (`m :- a(_).` then `:- initialization(m).`) compiles and runs -- so the trigger is a VARIABLE IN THE
# DIRECTIVE'S OWN GOAL TERM, not the call, not the predicate and not the directive.
#
# ⭐ THE MECHANISM IS A MISSING PASS ON ONE OF TWO PRODUCERS, AND THAT IS WHY IT LOOKS LIKE NOTHING.
# lower_pl_stage2 builds ONE top-level goal graph from TWO lists: an ordinary directive is wrapped and then
# numbered by pl_dir_number_vars, which assigns every variable its slot; an initialization goal is appended
# to init_goals with NO numbering at all. Both lists are concatenated into the same pl_body_graph. So a
# variable arriving from the initialization path carries no slot, and the emitter never reaches a fixed
# point.
#
# ⛔ THE ORACLE IS THE DISCRIMINATOR AND THE CONSTRUCT IS ORDINARY: swipl runs the identical file and prints
# the answer. This is ISO 7.4.2.4 / 7.9 -- initialization/1 takes a GOAL, and a goal with variables is the
# normal case, not an exotic one. THE TIMEOUT IS PART OF THE GRADE: a hang is the failure mode, so every arm
# is bounded and a bounded arm that does not answer is RED, never a refusal -- the one shape where silence
# must be read as failure rather than as could-not-measure.
