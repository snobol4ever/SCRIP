#
# Fixed WALL-TIME budget, iterations counted: a live doubling search (N=1,2,4,8,...) picks the largest N
# whose between+fail loop wrapper completes within TIME_BUDGET_MS, then reports iters/s = N / cpu_seconds.
# This N is DERIVED FRESH every run (never read from a committed file) -- the independence property the
# cross-proof needs against angle 2 (bench_prolog_fixed_iter.sh), which instead EXECUTES a pre-committed,
# historical N from corpus/benchmarks/prolog/fixed-iter-n.tsv. Same atomic operation (loop N times, measure),
# different SOURCE for N -- live-derived here, historically-committed there.

# ⛔ CORRECTNESS GATES THE TIMING (binding, ARCH-BENCH-CAMPAIGN-README-TABLES.md): this script re-verifies
# each kernel's SINGLE-SHOT output against corpus/benchmarks/prolog/bench/<k>.expected on gnu/swi/m3 before
# ever timing it -- a kernel that fails this is SKIPped, never silently timed anyway.

# "segmentation"/"core dumped" missed real crashes (the shell's own job-control notice does not reliably
# land in a redirected stderr capture), and a crashed run's tiny cpu_us then read as an implausibly FAST
# measurement. See FINDING-2026-08-27-seat14-prolog-second-call-into-any-user-predicate-crashes-m3-m4.md.
