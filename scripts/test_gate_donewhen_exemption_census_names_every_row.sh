# test_gate_donewhen_exemption_census_names_every_row.sh -- THE DONE-WHEN EXEMPTION CENSUS, PINNED BOTH WAYS (ceo CEO-967, on the coo's
# COO-116 report; row instruments-the-donewhen-exemption-census-names-every-criterion-that-measures-its-one-runner-exemption). The bus
# runs every computed DONE-WHEN under S4E_DONE_WHEN_RUN=1, a ONE-RUNNER exemption, so a criterion that runs the guard or a guarded
# runner can be measuring the exemption rather than its subject. util_donewhen_exemption_census.py names each such baton with its owner,
# its mechanism and its class (GUARD, BOARD) and counts the ones that clear the exemption (CLEAR).
# ARMS on a hermetic fixture tasks tree and QUEUE: (1) a live baton running a guarded board is named BOARD with its owner, and one reading
# the guard is named GUARD, rc 1; (2) a baton that clears the exemption first is counted CLEAR and never named; (3) a DONE baton is not
# named by default and is with --all; (4) the other direction: once both exposed criteria clear the exemption the census reads rc 0 with
# 0 exposed; (5) an unreadable tasks tree and an unreadable QUEUE each REFUSE rc 2, never a zero; (6) on the live postoffice it measures
# (rc 0 or 1) and prints its population beside the rc; (7) an AREA SMOKE the guard admits for every seat -- S4E_AREA_SMOKE_ENTRIES set
# non-empty on the command or exported before it, a runner in lib_one_runner.sh's ONE_RUNNER_SMOKE_MODE_RUNNERS, no population named --
# is counted SMOKE and never named, while a plain run of that runner, a smoke of a runner without a smoke mode, a smoke naming --corpus
# and a smoke beside another board stay BOARD (ceo CEO-1505: the census named hq_icon's closable IPL mask row; FAILED ONCE on the census
# before that landing, which read all six BOARD); (8) a census that cannot read the smoke-mode list REFUSES rc 2.
# ⛔ FAILED ONCE: before this landing there was no census, and the row's DONE-WHEN read "No such file".
# EXIT 0 every arm holds; 1 an arm is red; 2 REFUSED.
