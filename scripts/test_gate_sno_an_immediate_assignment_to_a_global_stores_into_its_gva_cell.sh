# test_gate_sno_an_immediate_assignment_to_a_global_stores_into_its_gva_cell.sh -- AN IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT ($ name) WHOSE TARGET IS A
# GVA GLOBAL is emitted as rt_cap_open_gva(cell, saved, cur, name): the emitted code hands the runtime the variable's own GVA cell
# (the same cell NV_CELL_IF_FASTSET_fn would find by name -- a function's local of that name lives in the same cell through the
# name-save, so dynamic scoping is untouched), and the entry allocates the substring, copies it and stores the DESCR without a
# hash lookup, a memo strcmp or the comm_var_active call (ceo 2026-09-24, CEO-1250: porter x4 at the 512 MB arena read
# NV_CELL_IF_FASTSET_fn 7.7% + strcmp 6.7% of cycles under the by-name form; 4.43 G -> 3.76 G instructions on the cure). The entry
# falls back to rt_cap_open_plain (the by-name store, unchanged) whenever an I/O association exists (g_call_fastpath_off), the
# monitor is attached, a TRACE is set or the debug trace is on -- so every observable side effect is the plain path's (a
# TRACE'd target therefore takes the direct entry and the runtime's trace_set_n test sends it down the plain path, where the
# trace line fires). The emitter keeps the by-name form for an I/O-associated name (the GVA collector refuses it) and a protected
# pattern name; a function's LOCAL of the name shares the global's cell (the name-save on entry swaps the cell's value), so the
# direct store is the local's store too. SCRIP_CAP_GVA=0 is the control arm (every site calls rt_cap_open_plain).
# THREE ARMS: (1) the witness's .s carries 10 rt_cap_open_gva sites and 1 rt_cap_open_plain site (the OUTPUT-associated target)
# under the cure, and 0 / 11 under the control arm; (2) the witness -- a pattern
# built at top level and matched inside a function that declares the target local (SPITBOL assigns the local), a pattern built
# inside a function on its own local, an OUTPUT-associated target (the assignment prints), a TRACE'd target (the trace line
# prints), three captures in one statement, a 2000-iteration ARB loop, and an immediate assignment inside a match that then
# fails (the value stays assigned) -- prints the oracle's lines in m3 and m4 under both arms; (3) the emitted call passes the cell
# and the name (the .s carries the name string beside the cell address at every gva site).
# ⛔ `$ ARB` (a protected pattern name) is left out on purpose: SPITBOL leaves ARB alone and continues, SCRIP raises error 42 --
# a pre-existing divergence on both arms, the row snobol4-an-immediate-assignment-to-a-protected-pattern-name-is-error-42-not-silent.
# ⛔ The OUTPUT-associated variable's VALUE is not read back on purpose: SPITBOL both writes the line and keeps the value, SCRIP's
# NV_SET_fn writes the line and drops the value -- a pre-existing divergence on both arms, the row
# snobol4-an-output-associated-variable-loses-the-value-it-was-assigned.
# EXIT 0 all arms; 1 a red (named); 2 REFUSED (oracle or binary missing).
