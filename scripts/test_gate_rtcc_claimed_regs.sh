# test_gate_rtcc_claimed_regs.sh — RTCC CLAIMED-REGISTER COLLISION GATE (GOAL-RTCC, RC-5 protection).
#
# WHY THIS GATE EXISTS. RC-5 assigns VM globals into registers that were previously ordinary scratch.
# A register claim is a GLOBAL fact about the whole emitted program, but templates are edited by many
# concurrent seats, and NOTHING in the build objects when a template grabs a claimed register as scratch.
# That is not hypothetical: RC-5-GVA claimed r9 = RT_GVA_VA, AB-2 then used r9 as anchor scratch in
# bb_save_restore.cpp, and the resulting fibonacci SIGSEGV cost sessions s6 and s7 (bisect + one-line fix,
# FINDING-2026-08-09-CLAUDE-SN46-RTCC-RC5-FLOATER-R9-RCX-FIX.md).  This gate makes that class MECHANICAL.
#
# THE INVARIANT.  Under RTCC_GLOBAL_R9_GVA with the killswitch ON, r9 holds RT_GVA_VA at EVERY point in
# generated code.  A template write to r9 opens a window with two distinct hazards:
#   (H1) LOCAL   — a GVARQ() access [r9+off] inside that window reads from a wrong base.
#   (H2) GLOBAL  — if a veneered call falls inside the window, x86_rtcc_wb_bin's `mov [rax+48], r9` stores
#                  the CLOBBERED value into the canonical block slot, and the matching reload propagates it.
#                  RT_GVA_VA is then destroyed for the REST OF THE PROCESS, not merely this template.
#   H2 is why rtcc_init.c's "seeded once; no companion writes needed anywhere" comment is not by itself a
#   guarantee: the veneer's own writeback IS a companion write on every crossing.
#
# WHAT IS CHECKED (textual, deliberately):  a full dataflow proof is out of scope for a grep gate, so this
# reports the HAZARD SURFACE and hard-fails only the COLLISION CLASS — files that both write a live-claimed
# register and read through GVARQ.  Those are the files where H1/H2 can co-occur inside one emitted region.
# A flagged file is NOT automatically a defect; it is a file that MUST be cleared by probe (RULES.md forbids
# conviction by code-reading) or entered in the whitelist with a justification.  Whitelisting is a capability
# registry, not a silencer: each line records WHO cleared it and HOW.
#
# LIVE CLAIMS ONLY.  Registers claimed-but-unassigned (no VM global living in them yet) are harmless to
# clobber today and are reported as INFORMATIONAL.  Add a register to LIVE_CLAIMS the moment RC-5 assigns a
# global to it — that one edit is what buys the next assignment this protection.
#
# Usage: bash scripts/test_gate_rtcc_claimed_regs.sh [--strict]
#   default  : INFORMATIONAL — print hazard surface + collision class, exit 0.
#   --strict : HARD GATE — exit 1 if any non-whitelisted file is in the collision class.
