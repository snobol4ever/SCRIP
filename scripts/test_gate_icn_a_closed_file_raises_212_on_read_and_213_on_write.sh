#
# WHAT WAS THERE. close() was a no-op on &input, &output and &errout (the BID_close arm closed only idx > 2), so a program that
# closed &input went on reading it and one that closed &output went on writing it; and a closed user file made read, reads,
# !f and write FAIL QUIETLY, where Arizona iconx raises run-time error 212 (attempt to read file not open for reading) or 213
# (attempt to write file not open for writing). Found by the IcnBench loop test: rsg closes &input at the end of main, so its
# second in-process iteration is error 212 under iconx while SCRIP printed a second clean copy.
#
# WHAT IS HERE. The file slot carries a `closed` flag: close() sets it (the process's own std streams stay open underneath and
# are flushed, so the runtime's diagnostics still reach stderr), fh_alloc clears it when a slot is reused, and read, reads, !f,
# write and writes -- the by-name arms and the emitted single-argument write fast path -- raise 212/213 through core_icn_error,
# so &error converts them to failure with &errornumber set exactly as iconx does.
#
# ARMS. (1) STRUCTURE: the flag exists, close sets it, fh_alloc clears it, and the fast-path writers test it. (2) BEHAVIOUR, both
# media, graded against the LIVE oracle (icont/iconx 9.5.25a) on five witnesses: stdout byte-identical, the same exit status,
# and the same run-time error number on stderr. A witness the oracle does not run refuses the gate rather than passing it.
