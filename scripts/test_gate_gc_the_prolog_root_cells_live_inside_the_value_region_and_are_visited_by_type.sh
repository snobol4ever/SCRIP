# ⛔ THE ROW'S GATE (ceo CEO-953, minted on the cto's gdb reading; row prolog-the-64-root-cells-grow-down-from-root-24-...).
# THE DEFECT: unification.c defines PL_DB_CELL0 24 and PL_DB_CELLS_MAX 64, so rt_pl_db_get/rt_pl_nb_set address cell k at
# (root - 24 - 8k) -- 64 cells growing DOWNWARD from root-24, 512 bytes of them.  emit.cpp:3197 places main's ROOT frame map
# cell at the jcon value region as a 16-byte DT_MAP cell, which the cto measured under gdb at root-48 with frame_bytes 272.
# The two regions occupy the same words, so a Prolog program with more than one dynamic predicate or nb global scribbles on
# the frame map cell of its own root frame.
# MEASURED ON MAIN AT 1027e8db2, both modes, SCRIP_HEAP_MB=1, stress 0/1/3/5: the witness reads 3-1-1-1-1 against the swipl
# oracle's 3-3-3-3-3 at EVERY point of the band, stress 0 included.  So the primary defect is the OVERLAP, not a lost root:
# only the first dynamic predicate keeps its clauses and every later one keeps exactly one.  A control arm with literal
# assertz and no =.. reads the same, so this is not the witness's own construction.
# THE CURE the row asks for: the lowerer and emitter place the Prolog cell region INSIDE the tabled value region as PTR_GC
# words -- out of the map cell's way, and visited by type rather than found by a sweep (which is what E removes).
# A stale binary or a missing witness REFUSES rc=2.
