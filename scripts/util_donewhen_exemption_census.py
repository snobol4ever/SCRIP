"""util_donewhen_exemption_census.py -- AN EXEMPTION IS INVISIBLE TO THE THING IT EXEMPTS (ceo CEO-967, on the coo's COO-116 report;
row instruments-the-donewhen-exemption-census-names-every-criterion-that-measures-its-one-runner-exemption).

The bus runs every computed DONE-WHEN with S4E_DONE_WHEN_RUN=1, a sanctioned ONE-RUNNER exemption (lib_one_runner.sh admits the run
whatever seat asks). So a criterion that shells out to a board, a suite runner or the guard itself and reads what comes back can be
measuring THE EXEMPTION rather than its subject: measured on COO-116, the one criterion on one tree read G=0 with the exemption set
and G=2 with it cleared. This census NAMES every such baton -- it fixes none (the ceo: "name them, do not sweep them") -- because for
some rows the exemption merely admits a run the criterion wants, and for others it is the whole verdict, and only the row's owner can
tell which. Each exposed baton is printed with its QUEUE.tsv owner and state, the mechanism it shells out to, and a class:

  GUARD   the criterion runs the one-runner guard itself (lib_one_runner.sh, one_runner_guard) and reads its answer -- under the
          exemption the guard admits everyone, so the verdict IS the exemption. The owner must rewrite it.
  BOARD   the criterion runs a guarded board or runner (a name in scripts/one_runner_boards.txt, corpus_suite_harness.py run, or any
          test_*_suite.sh / board_*.sh / scorecard_*.sh) and reads its rc or output -- the exemption ADMITS the run; the owner says
          whether admitting it is what the criterion means.
  CLEAR   it runs one of those but clears the exemption first (env -u S4E_DONE_WHEN_RUN, S4E_DONE_WHEN_RUN= , unset) -- measured
          on its own terms; counted, never named as exposed.

EXIT 0: measured, no LIVE baton exposed. 1: at least one live baton exposed (named). 2: the tasks tree or QUEUE could not be read -- a
census that reports zero exposed rows because it could not look is the very defect it exists to name. S4E_TASKS / S4E_QUEUE redirect
it (the gate's fixture); --json prints one JSON document instead of lines; --all names DONE rows too.
