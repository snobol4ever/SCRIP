#!/usr/bin/env bash
# test_gate_pristine_lock_timeout.sh -- NEGATIVE-TEST gate for row
# `build-governor-holds-pristine-while-box-idles`.
#
# Behavioral gate on scripts/lib_pristine_lock.sh, the bounded-wait wrapper the Makefile's `pristine`/
# `pristine-all` targets now use around BUILD_LOCK instead of a bare unbounded `flock`. Proves: (1) an
# uncontended acquire runs the wrapped command and passes its exit code through verbatim; (2) a holder
# that releases BEFORE the bound lets the wrapped command proceed once free (the sibling row
# make-pristine-per-root-flock-second-builder-waits' own "second builder waits, then runs" contract,
# unweakened by this change); (3) THE ROW'S OWN POINT -- a holder that outlives the bound produces a
# REFUSAL (rc=99), never a silent hang, and the wrapped command NEVER RUNS (checked by absence of its
# side effect, not just the return code, same discipline test_gate_build_governor.sh uses for its
# analogous refusal assertions); (4) the refusal diagnostic actually names something (not a bare exit
# code with no explanation -- the whole complaint against the old mechanism was silence); (5)/(6) a bad
# lock path refuses (rc=98) and a missing command refuses (rc=64), the usage-error edges.
#
# Per lib_gate.sh's three-way contract: 0 CLEAN, 1 VIOLATION (an assertion below failed), 2 UNPROVEN
# (flock/fuser or the library itself is missing, so nothing could be examined).
#
# ⛔ ISOLATION IS LOAD-BEARING: every assertion runs against a SCRATCH lockfile, never the real
# per-root /tmp/si_pristine_lock-* -- a gate run must never contend with a genuine fleet pristine build.
# All timeouts here are test-scaled (1-2s), not the real 1200s default.
