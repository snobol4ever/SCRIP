# test_gate_sno_every_variable_keeps_its_own_standard_stream_association.sh -- every variable INPUT() or OUTPUT() associates
# with a standard stream keeps ITS OWN association, as under sbl -bf (ceo CEO-1401, 2026-10-02).
#
# ⛔⭐ FOUND BY MODERNIZING spitbol_testpgms/test8.spt ON LON'S WORD ("fix the I/O associations to be modern"): its three
# OUTPUT('TITLE',6,'(14H1...)') associations became OUTPUT(.TITLE), OUTPUT(.DEALER), OUTPUT(.SKIP), and SCRIP printed only
# SKIP. THE CAUSE: a one-argument OUTPUT(.X) always took channel 6, closed it and stored the one name the channel table
# holds, so every new association EVICTED the previous one (INPUT(.X) the same on channel 5); an empty channel and file
# argument, OUTPUT(.X,,''), made no association at all where sbl associates the standard stream; a variable moved from a
# file to standard output kept writing to the file (the lookup found its older channel first); and associating another
# variable with standard input moved the INPUT variable's own stream off its file. THE CURE (core.c _io_assoc_std): the
# variable is detached from every channel it held, then given its own slot on the shared standard stream -- channel 5 or
# 6 when free, else a free slot from the top of the table -- and the INPUT variable's stream is never touched for another
# variable. The expectation of every arm is cut from sbl -bf at run time; nothing is pinned.
#
# THE ARMS, each in m3 and m4, each byte-identical to sbl -bf on the same witness and stdin:
#   1 two OUTPUT(.X) associations both write        2 three in a row (test8's shape)
#   3 OUTPUT(.A,,'') is standard output             4 two INPUT(.X) associations read in turn
#   5 INPUT(.A,,'') is standard input               6 a variable moved from a file to standard output
#   7 DETACH(.A) leaves B associated                8 re-associating the same variable keeps one association
#   9 another variable on standard input leaves INPUT on its file
#  10 DETECTOR -- OUTPUT(.OUTPUT) stays a no-op and plain OUTPUT writes once, so a cure that double-wrote fails here
# EXIT: 0 every arm passes · 1 an arm failed · 2 REFUSED (no binary, no oracle, a toolchain failure).
