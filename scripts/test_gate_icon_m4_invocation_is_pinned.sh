# scripts/test_gate_icon_m4_invocation_is_pinned.sh -- THE PROGRAM NAME IS THE SAME IN BOTH MODES: THE BARE STEM.
# DONE-WHEN for row icon-progname-class-one-ref-cannot-be-right-for-both-modes-master-and-jcon (CEO-569), rewritten
# under ceo CEO-624 (2026-09-12) on Lon's word, verbatim: "Why is mode 3 different from mode 4? they were intended to
# be identical."  AUTHORS: Lon Jones Cherryholmes · Claude Fable 5.1   DATE: 2026-09-12 (first version Opus 5, 09-11)
#
# ⭐⭐ THE MEASUREMENT THIS GATE RESTS ON, taken on the ORACLE (Arizona icont/iconx 9.5.25a) and re-taken every run:
#     iconx pn                  -> &progname: pn          (the program invoked by its bare name)
#     ./pn                      -> &progname: ./pn
#     /abs/path/to/pn           -> &progname: /abs/path/to/pn
# &progname is the name the program was INVOKED BY.  CEO-581 let the two modes answer differently because the
# runners invoked them differently (m3 was handed `<stem>.icn`, m4 was run as `./<stem>`) and covered the gap with a
# PER-MODE REF.  CEO-624 closes the gap at its cause instead: THE PROGRAM NAME IS THE SAME STRING IN BOTH MODES.
#   * mode 3: `scrip --run path/<stem>.icn` names the program `path/<stem>` -- the source path with its extension
#     stripped, which is exactly the name icont gives the program it builds from that source;
#   * mode 4: every runner invokes the binary by that same string -- the bare `<stem>`, resolved through PATH (the
#     master harness, the jcon runner and the arizona runner all put the binary's directory first on PATH and invoke
#     `<stem>`), so argv[0] is `<stem>` and the oracle under the same invocation (`iconx <stem>`) answers the same;
#   * therefore ONE ref line is right for both modes, cut from the oracle under `iconx <stem>`, and NO per-mode
#     declaration for &progname exists any more (the .moderef MECHANISM stays for a line the invocation genuinely
#     determines; this gate asserts no &progname row is left in it).
#
# ⛔ IT GRADES ON ITS OWN FIXTURES, NEVER ON A BOARD (CEO-547 part 2, ONE RUNNER ONE BOARD): a source-level assertion
# over the three graders, a live round trip on a witness it compiles itself, the one-entry master graded THROUGH the
# harness, and the two shipped programs that print &progname extracted and run directly.  No board, no row written.
# With icont unreachable this gate REFUSES rc=2: an instrument that cannot measure refuses.
#
# EXIT: 0 every clause green · 1 a clause is red (the report names which) · 2 REFUSED -- cannot measure.
