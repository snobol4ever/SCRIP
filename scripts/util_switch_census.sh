#!/usr/bin/env bash
# util_switch_census.sh -- CERTIFY the SET-today env-var switch list by real measurement.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (hq_C s269, brief CEO-11c "empirical-switch-rule"):
#   Lon's rule is THE KEEP-LIST IS EXACTLY THE SWITCHES SET TODAY, everything else dies.
#   That makes "is this switch set?" a load-bearing question, and the first census answered it
#   at SUBSTRING level and reported ~8.  The real number is 48.  A 6x error in the direction of
#   deleting live configuration is the kind this script exists to make un-repeatable.
#
# ⛔ THE TWO TRAPS, both hit on the first honest pass, both defended against here:
#   (1) PROSE IS NOT A SETTING.  131 of 181 "assigned" names are assigned only inside .github/
#       and corpus/ -- FINDINGs, READMEs and probe programs QUOTING a command line.  Grepping the
#       org brain for FOO= certifies documentation as configuration.  Assignments are therefore
#       ATTRIBUTED PER TREE and only the live harness (scripts/ + Makefile) certifies a keep.
#   (2) A COMMENT IS NOT A SETTING, AND ARGV IS.  Comment-only mentions are filtered out (3 of 50
#       were).  But a switch can also be set through a door no assignment regex can see: e.g.
#       test_gate_zdp_on_null.sh:27 takes VAR=1 AS ARGV (`ENVS=("$@")`), which is how SCRIP_ZONE
#       is really set today.  Such doors are listed in ARGV_DOORS below and must be read, not
#       grepped -- so this script REPORTS them for a human rather than pretending to resolve them.
