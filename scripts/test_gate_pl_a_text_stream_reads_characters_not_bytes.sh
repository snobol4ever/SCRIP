# test_gate_pl_a_text_stream_reads_characters_not_bytes.sh -- get_char/get_code/peek_char/peek_code on a TEXT
# stream must yield one CODE POINT per call and must consume a leading BOM, while a BINARY stream keeps its
# byte semantics (row prolog-logtalk-encodings-group, hq_C 2026-09-13).
#
# THE DEFECT THIS PINS. All four character reads were a bare fgetc, so a UTF-8 file read one character at a
# time came back one BYTE at a time and every non-ASCII character split into its encoding. Measured against
# swipl 9.0.4 on 2026-09-13: the four-character file `a<U+00E9>b\n` read 4 characters under the oracle and
# FIVE here, with the e-acute arriving as two replacement characters. The atom layer was never the defect --
# atom_length for a one-character non-ASCII atom is 1 on both sides -- which is exactly why this survived: an
# engine can be fully UTF-8 aware in its terms and still read files a byte at a time, and every ASCII test in
# the suite passes identically either way. ⭐ NO LOGTALK CASE FLIPPED ON THIS CURE, so without this arm the
# whole change is invisible to every board and the next byte-oriented rewrite of get_char is uncontested.
#
# ⛔ ARM 3 IS THE ARM THAT STOPS THE OVER-BROAD CURE. Decoding unconditionally -- on type(binary) streams too
# -- passes ARMS 1 and 2 perfectly and silently corrupts get_byte/peek_byte, whose whole contract is that a
# byte is a byte. A cure that trades one case for another never lands (CEO-589), so the binary arm is graded
# beside the text ones, always.
#
# ⛔ THE BOM IS A STREAM ANNOTATION, NOT DATA, AND bom(false) IS THE WAY TO ASK FOR THE BYTES. swipl consumes
# a leading BOM on open and hands back the first real character; reading it as U+FEFF corrupts the first term
# of every BOM-carrying file. ARM 4 grades the bom(false) escape hatch, which must still deliver 0xFEFF as
# ONE character -- that is the suite's own lgt_unicode_open_4_read_09 expectation.
# rc 0 green · 1 red · 2 could not measure.
