# hq_prolog 2026-09-16 on X = f(X), copy_term(X, Y) dying with ERROR 246 in both modes; swi core/test_fastrw.pl reached it

# THE ARM: nine lines against a ref cut from SWI-Prolog 9.0.4 -- a self cycle, a fresh copy of a ground cycle (== says equal,
# as swipl does), a mutual cycle through two functors, sharing of a variable and of the term itself, a cycle under a list and
# under a nested functor, a cyclic and a mutually cyclic term copied out of findall, the copy still cyclic to acyclic_term/1,
# and a ground cycle beside an atom -- in mode 3 and mode 4. FAIL_ONCE=1 plants one wrong line into the ref to prove the arm
# can say no. rc=0 clean · rc=1 a divergence · rc=2 REFUSAL.
