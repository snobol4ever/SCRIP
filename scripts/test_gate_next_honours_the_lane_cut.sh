# test_gate_next_honours_the_lane_cut.sh -- THE DEPENDENCY-PROMOTION PATH IN `next` MUST HONOUR THE SAME
# LANE CUT AND MODE LANGUAGE FREEZE THE ORDINARY FREE-ROW PATH ALREADY APPLIES, BEFORE IT EVER CLAIMS A ROW.
# Row next-dependency-promotion-walks-around-the-mode-lane-filter (seat01 measured the class; hq_B minted).
#
# THE MEASURED DEFECT: with MODE reading FLEET-8 ON SNOBOL4 ONLY and seat01's lane being snoflake/aisnobol/
# dotnet, `next` served and CLAIMED icon-ladder-every-feature-in-isolation-with-variations (rank 1, Icon) --
# promoted as the blocker of another rank-1 Icon row. THE ENABLING DEFECT: s4e_servable_blocker (CURE 1,
# picker-dependency-and-boomerang-blindness) only asks "is the blocker in a servable STATE" and, on yes,
# the caller claims and serves it immediately -- neither the lane filter nor any language-freeze check
# (which did not exist at all) ever ran on the PROMOTED row, only on the row it displaced.
#
# WHAT IT PROVES, against a THROWAWAY postoffice (S4E_POST) so the live queue is never read or written:
#   (a) OWN-LANE PASS REFUSES A CROSS-LANE PROMOTION: a blocked own-lane row whose blocker is a DIFFERENT
#       lane's FREE row does NOT get that blocker promoted+served in the own-lane pass -- a genuine
#       own-lane row at a worse rank is served instead, exactly as the ordinary FREE-row path already
#       prefers own-lane over rank.
#   (b) THE REFUSAL IS PRINTED, NEVER SILENT: naming the blocked row, the refused blocker, and the lane
#       mismatch -- per the row's own explicit requirement.
#   (c) CROSS-LANE FALLBACK STILL WORKS FOR PROMOTION: when the seat's own lane truly has nothing else
#       servable, the blocker IS promoted and served cross-lane -- dependency inversion is not removed,
#       only gated, exactly as the row's GOAL insists ("do NOT fix this by removing dependency promotion").
#   (d) THE MODE LANGUAGE FREEZE REFUSES A PROMOTION EVEN WHEN THE LANE MATCHES: a same-lane blocker whose
#       LANGUAGE differs from an active "ON <LANG> ONLY" freeze is refused -- this is the actual shape of
#       the reported incident (owner cell was already correct; nothing but a language-phase rule should
#       have stopped it, and until this fix nothing did).
#   (e) THE FREEZE REFUSAL IS ALSO PRINTED, NEVER SILENT.
#   (f) POSITIVE CONTROL -- NO FREEZE ACTIVE: the identical same-lane, wrong-"language" blocker from (d) IS
#       promotable when MODE carries no "ON ... ONLY" clause -- proves the freeze check does not misfire
#       when it should be a no-op, not just that it fires when it should.
#   (g) POSITIVE CONTROL -- LANGUAGE-NEUTRAL TOPIC: a promotion candidate with no recognized language
#       prefix (tooling/meta, this row's own kind of topic) is unaffected by an active freeze.

# ⛔⭐⭐ THE FIXTURE DERIVES ITS LANGUAGE FROM THE PICKER UNDER TEST, AND NAMES NONE (hq_B 2026-09-13, ceo
# CEO-672). This block used to read `printf 'hq_B\n' > "$W/seat07/HQ"` with the comment "seat07's lane is
# hq_B for this fixture (icon)", and every row below hardcoded `hq_B` as its owner cell -- a FOURTH copy of
# the language->owner table, living inside the very test that grades the picker that owns the table.
# ⭐ WHEN NONET MOVED ICON TO THE CEO, CHECK (a) WENT RED FOR THE WRONG REASON. Promotion had not broken; the
# fixture still believed hq_B owned Icon, so seat07 had no own-lane row and the cross-lane blocker was
# CORRECTLY promoted. A fixture that restates its subject's facts does not fail when the subject is wrong --
# it fails when the subject is RIGHT and has moved, which is the most expensive red there is: it points at
# the cure and calls it the bug. Editing the assertion to match would have buried a real defect.
# ⛔ AND CHASING IT UNCOVERED THE REAL ONE: `s4e_my_lane` recognises only hq_* names, so an executive is not a
# lane at all. Under NONET four of the seven completeness owners ARE executives, so a seat whose HQ is one of
# them resolves to NO lane and goes lane-blind. That is documented, deliberate ("ceo is never restricted") and
# is a separate ruling from this row -- so the fixture must not depend on it either way.
# ⭐ SO IT ASKS FOR WHAT IT ACTUALLY NEEDS: a language whose owner IS lane-determinable, chosen at run time.
# The checks below grade the PROMOTION and FREEZE mechanisms, which is their real subject, and they now
# survive every future lane cut without an edit.
