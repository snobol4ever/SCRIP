# test_gate_no_stored_code_address_in_the_prolog_gate.sh -- LON ORDERED IR_MOVE_LABEL DELETED AND THIS IS
# WHAT HOLDS IT DELETED. Lon 2026-09-13, in-chat to ceo, verbatim: "The IR_MOVE_LABEL is invalid. There are
# no labels. That is a carry over from JCON. Delete that IR." (CEO-693).
#
# WHAT THE OP WAS: IR_MOVE_LABEL stored a CODE ADDRESS into a frame slot (bb_move_label.cpp: lea rax,<target>
# then mov [gate+16],rax) and IR_INDIRECT_GOTO jumped through it on its beta port (bb_indirect_goto.cpp: jmp
# [gate+16]). The two are ONE IDIOM and neither survives alone -- INDIRECT_GOTO had no other writer in the
# tree, so deleting the writer and keeping the reader leaves a box jumping through a slot nobody fills. They
# are lowered by Prolog if-then-else (lower_prolog.c pl_lower_ite) and soft cut (pl_lower_softcut) and by
# nothing else in any frontend, which is why this is a Prolog-lane row and not an engine-wide one.
#
# ⛔ WHY A GATE AND NOT A GREP-ONCE: the ceo's second hazard (CEO-693) is the quiet one. IR_MOVE_LABEL is
# CLASSIFIED IN FOUR PLACES IN frame_layout.c -- the gate.stored-resume-target field at :173, zls_is_wiring
# at :207, and two shape lists at :228 and :279. An op deleted from the enum but left in one of those lists
# is A SILENT SLOT-GRANTING CHANGE, NOT A COMPILE ERROR: the enum value is reused by whatever op follows it,
# so the classification silently starts applying to a different op. All four move together or none do, and
# that is a claim spanning five files, which RULES.md says must be held by an instrument and not by memory.
#
# ARM 1 (the red one before the cure): no source in src/ names the deleted ops or their templates.
# ARM 2 (the control, GREEN BEFORE AND AFTER): the if-then-else and soft-cut witness set answers BYTE-
# IDENTICALLY to swipl in BOTH MODES. It is 28 lines over 15 predicates and it is chosen to exercise the
# GATE and not merely the construct -- a deterministic arm, an arm that leaves a redo, an arm containing a
# cut, an else arm that backtracks, a nested if-then-else, soft cut with and without an else, soft cut whose
# condition leaves a choicepoint, both forms inside findall, and BACKTRACKING BACK INTO an arm from after
# the construct, which is the only shape that reads the gate's beta port at all. A cure that deletes the op
# and quietly makes if-then-else deterministic passes arm 1 and fails arm 2 -- that is the point of arm 2.
# ⛔ ARM 2 IS NOT A BOARD: it grades ONE mktemp witness written by this script, no corpus population, so
# every seat may run it (ONE RUNNER, ONE BOARD, CEO-523).
# ARM 3 (the scoping arm, ruled by CEO-694 on Lon 2026-09-13, verbatim: "We use static wiring only, unless
# it is an if-type construct. So fix that."): the gate ops may be BUILT only inside the two if-type lowerings
# in lower_prolog.c. ⛔ THIS IS THE HALF THAT MATTERS MORE THAN THE RENAME, and the ceo named the reason: the
# deleted op's real damage was that it MADE A SELECTED CONTINUATION AVAILABLE AS A GENERAL FACILITY that any
# construct could reach for, so an exception to static wiring quietly became the ordinary case with nobody
# ruling that it should. A FACILITY REACHABLE BY EVERYTHING IS USED BY EVERYTHING. Scoping it to the
# construct permitted to have it is what makes the exception ENFORCEABLE rather than advisory, and a census
# is what makes the scope a fact rather than a convention a future seat has to know about.
# ⛔ THE CEO'S OWN SPLIT OF THESE SITES IS CORRECTED HERE ON THE SOURCE, not disputed in prose (cto, CEO-694):
# CEO-693/694 read lower_prolog.c:542-544 and :564 as "the catch/3 error-catcher-try triple" and ruled them
# NOT if-type, so three sites move and one stays. THEY ARE NOT catch/3. They are pl_lower_softcut -- the ISO
# soft cut (C *-> T ; E) -- and pl_lower_catch, which begins below them, builds NO gate at all and never did.
# A soft cut is an if-then-else whose condition does not commit, so under Lon's rule as written ALL FIVE
# sites are if-type constructs and the exception covers all five. That is why this arm names TWO functions
# rather than one, and it is a census a reader can re-run instead of a claim about who was right.
# EXIT 0 all arms green; 1 an arm red (named); 2 REFUSED -- could not measure, never a quiet pass.
