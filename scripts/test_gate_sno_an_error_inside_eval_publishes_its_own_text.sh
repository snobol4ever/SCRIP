# test_gate_sno_an_error_inside_eval_publishes_its_own_text.sh -- an error raised INSIDE an EVAL'd expression
# publishes the same &ERRTEXT and &ERRTYPE it publishes outside one.
#
# ⛔ THE DEFECT (ceo 2026-09-14, the x64 math family). rt_real_overflow raised the SNOBOL4 error only when
# `g_error == 0`, and eval_chain_run_guarded sets `g_error = -1` for the duration of an EVAL -- so inside an
# EVAL the overflow took the OTHER arm, core_icn_error(204), and returned failure with nothing published.
# Measured on one witness: `1.0e300 * 1.0e300` direct gives errtext="multiplication caused real overflow"
# errtype=263; the SAME expression through EVAL gave errtext=[] errtype=0.
#
# ⭐ THE CLASS, because the fix is small and the shape is not: g_error carried TWO meanings -- Icon's error
# trap AND "an EVAL guard is armed" -- and the arithmetic read it as the first while EVAL wrote it as the
# second. One global, two owners, and the arm that lost is the one that publishes the text a program reads.
# The discriminator is now kw_errlimit, which is a SNOBOL4 keyword rather than a language test, so this stays
# inside the no-language-discriminator law.
#
# ⛔ WHAT IT COST: chks.inc grades the x64 math programs by comparing &ERRTEXT against the expected error
# string, so every overflow case compared "" against "division caused real overflow". math_div was 1984
# failures of ONE shape and math_prod the same; both are 15376/0 and 14400/0 after the cure.
#
# The expectation is the oracle's: sbl -bf publishes the text in both positions. rc=0 clean · rc=1 the text
# or the type differs between the two positions · rc=2 REFUSAL (cannot measure).
