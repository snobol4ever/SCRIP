#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (hq_R's witness .github b76ecb2e9, cured by hq_U on the ceo's scan/conjunction-resumption
# cut).  A RETURN executed from inside a string-scanning block leaves the ENCLOSING scan pointed at the INNER
# subject.  `"AB" ? (inner("zz") || move(1))` printed `zzz` in both modes where iconx prints `zzA`: inner
# returns `zz`, then the outer `move(1)` takes the second character of `zz` instead of the second character
# of `AB`.  TT_RETURN built an IR_RETURN and never unwound cx->scan_sp, while TT_SUSPEND, TT_LOOP_BREAK and
# TT_LOOP_NEXT all did -- the one exit out of a scan body that was not unwinding.
#
# ⭐ THE CONTROL ARM IS WHAT MADE IT CHEAP AND IT IS AN ARM HERE FOR THAT REASON (hq_R's, kept in their
# words): move the return OUT of the scan block and it was already GREEN.  So nested scanning worked, calling
# a scanning procedure from inside a scan worked, and the save-restore was correct on the block's NORMAL exit
# path.  Only the EARLY-RETURN path lacked it.  A defect with a green twin has its cure named by the twin --
# and the twin is also the arm that catches an over-broad cure, because a fix that unwinds too much breaks
# the case that was never broken.
#
# ⛔ GRADED AGAINST iconx, NEVER AGAINST A PINNED STRING.  Every expected value here comes from the oracle at
# run time; a hand-typed `zzA` in this file would be a self-pin wearing an oracle's clothes.
