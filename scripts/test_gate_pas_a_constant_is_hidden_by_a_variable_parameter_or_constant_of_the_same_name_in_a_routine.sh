# test_gate_pas_a_constant_is_hidden_by_a_variable_parameter_or_constant_of_the_same_name_in_a_routine.sh -- a routine's own variable, parameter, local constant or enumerator hides an outer constant of the same name (ISO 7185 6.2.2.1, 6.2.2.2).
#
# MEASURED 2026-10-09 by hq_pascal against fpc -Miso: with `const maxsize = 32;` at program level, `procedure u; var minsize, maxsize, lsize: integer; begin maxsize := minsize; ... end` read the constant 32 wherever the body wrote maxsize, in both modes; the same for a parameter named like a
# constant (`procedure q(n: integer)` with `const n = 5`), a local constant that redefines an outer one, and a local variable named like an enumerator (`red`). The constant table was one list keyed by name, and identifier resolution took a constant before it looked at the scope.
# Found running Pascal-P5's compiler: pcom's recordtype has `var minsize, maxsize, lsize: addrrange` under the program constant `maxsize = 32`, so every variant record was sized 32 bytes at most, the record copy of Pascal-P5's Dhrystone dropped the last 11 bytes of a string, and
# the P-code of its record types differed from the native compiler's.
# CURE (pascal.y only; no new global, no new table): a constant records the scope uid of its defining occurrence (pas_scope_uid at pas_const_add) and pas_const_get accepts it only while that is still the innermost visible definition of the name; and a field name declared in a record
# body (a scope definition made while g_pas_recbody_depth is nonzero, now marked fld) no longer counts as a definition of that name in pas_scope_uid, so a record field called like a constant does not hide the constant.
#
# ARMS, both modes: one control cut LIVE from fpc -Miso that must be byte-identical: a local variable, a parameter, a local constant redefining an outer one, a local variable named like an enumerator, three locals one named like the constant, a record field named like the constant,
# and the constants read at program level before and after all of them. FAIL_ONCE=1 corrupts the control's ref.
