# test_gate_pas_a_set_member_is_of_an_ordinal_type.sh -- ISO 7185 6.7.1, refused at compile time
#
# MEASURED 2026-09-23 by hq_pascal on SCRIP a722fc6b4, both modes, row pascal-all-test-suites-of-the-language-read-100-percent-on-the-
# suite-table-the-home-stretch (class row pascal-pat-static-type-and-parameter-checking). The type T "of every expression of each
# member-designator of the set-constructor ... shall be an ordinal-type" (6.7.1). set_member built the constructor whatever its
# expression was, so PAT iso7185prt1901 ([r] <> [] with r: real) compiled and ran. The check sits on both set_member productions
# (x and x..y) and reuses the assignment-compatibility classifiers: a real literal or constant, a string of other than one
# character, or a bare variable whose EVERY declaration resolves to real, is refused.
# Before landing, every acceptance program in the corpus (PasM, the FPC suite, P4, P5, the benchmarks, 456 programs) was compiled
# with the check: the refused set was identical to the tree before.
#
# ARMS: one vendored PAT witness, required to be REFUSED with a non-empty diagnostic in BOTH modes (m4 compiles, and if the compile is
# accepted, links and runs). A second arm proves the check DISCRIMINATES: set-constructors over integer variables, expressions and
# ranges, char literals and ranges and enumerated values run byte-identical to fpc -Miso in both modes (fpc refuses a constructor that
# mixes variables with a literal range, so the integer set is built by unions). A third arm is COMPILE-ONLY: [r] over a global integer
# r shadowed by a local r: real must be ACCEPTED, as fpc -Miso accepts it. FAIL_ONCE=1 flips the witness.
