# bench_ir_slope.sh -- THE TWO-NUMBER BASIS FOR **SLOPE** KERNELS, MEASURED AS AN Ir REGRESSION.
# Row readme-perf-grids-three-angles-all-seven (I26), hq_P 2026-09-03, ceo audit CEO-192.
#
# ⛔⭐ WHY THIS EXISTS AND WHY bench_two_number_ir.sh IS NOT ENOUGH -- MEASURED, NOT THEORISED.
# A benchmarks/snobol4 kernel is not a whole program you run once: it exposes a `*BENCH kernel=NAME`
# entry point and a harness LOOPS it N times, so its published number is a SLOPE with startup divided
# away. Running such a kernel once (which is what a whole-program Ir board does) answers a DIFFERENT,
# NARROWER QUESTION -- "what does one default-sized run cost, startup included" -- and nothing in the
# output says so. hq_P measured the consequence on this row: a whole-program Ir board over the 21
# SNOBOL4 kernels put 12 of them into the CEO-173 >=50%-startup refusal and printed multiples as low
# as 0.140x, because SCRIP's 2.79M-Ir process startup swamped kernels doing ~80K Ir of actual work.
# Those numbers were all correctly measured and all answering the wrong question (RULES.md § THE
# INSTRUMENT LAWS, batch 15 §1 -- the instrument that answers a narrower question never says so).
#
# THE METHOD -- A REGRESSION, WHICH GIVES **BOTH** NUMBERS OF THE TWO-NUMBER BASIS EXACTLY.
# Build the same kernel at N, 2N and 4N iterations (scripts/bench_wrap.sh --mode=iter), count Ir for
# each, and fit the straight line Ir(n) = OVERHEAD + n*WORK:
#   WORK     = the SLOPE     = instructions per iteration -- startup CANCELS EXACTLY in the difference,
#              it is not estimated and not subtracted from a separate empty program.
#   OVERHEAD = the INTERCEPT = Ir(N) - N*WORK -- process startup + one-time setup, its own number.
# ⭐ This is strictly better than the law's "marked interim" (empty-program subtraction): the interim
# approximates startup with a DIFFERENT program's startup, while the intercept measures THIS program's
# own. It is the same two numbers the law asks for, obtained without the subtraction that CEO-173 had
# to add a refusal for.
#
# THE ADEQUACY CHECK IS BUILT IN, AND IT IS THE Ir ANALOGUE OF THE ANGLE-1-vs-ANGLE-2 CROSS-PROOF.
# Two independent slopes are computed -- from (N,2N) and from (2N,4N). If the kernel is in its linear
# regime they agree; if it is not (a kernel whose per-iteration cost grows, an N too small to have left
# the setup transient), they diverge and the row prints NONLINEAR instead of a number. That is exactly
# what angles 1 and 2 do for each other on the wall clock, minus the noise: RULES.md calls the
# triangulation "itself the adequacy check that the measurement ran long enough".
# ⛔ WHAT THIS DOES NOT MEASURE: Ir counts instructions retired, not cycles. It cannot see cache
# misses, branch mispredicts or memory stalls, so it is NOT a wall-clock predictor and never replaces
# the timed angles -- it answers "how much work does the engine do per iteration", which is the
# question the WORK column asks. Every grid fed by it says so.
#
# EXIT: 0 = board printed, 1 = a kernel was UNPROVEN/NONLINEAR, 2 = REFUSED.
