"""util_icon_semicolon_class_classifier.py — THE MEASURED SEMICOLON-CLASS CLASSIFIER (CEO-489, hq_V 2026-09-10).

Reads shipped-.icn paths (corpus-relative, one per line) on stdin and prints one line per file:

    SEMICOLON\t<path>\t<n> semicolon(s)
    OTHER\t<path>\t<icont's first complaint>
    UNDECIDED\t<path>\t<why the budget ran out>

⛔⛔ WHAT "SEMICOLON CLASS" MEANS HERE, AND WHY IT IS DEMONSTRATED RATHER THAN PATTERN-MATCHED.
A file is SEMICOLON class only when this tool has RE-RUN THE ORACLE and shown that deleting `;` BYTES AND
NOTHING ELSE makes `icont -s -c` accept it. That is exactly the assertion CEO-488's DONE-WHEN makes per file
(bytes removed == semicolons removed), so the classifier and the row's success criterion are the same
statement — a file this tool calls SEMICOLON is a file hq_B can repair by deletion alone, proven, not guessed.

The tempting rule — "the token icont quotes is a `;`" — is MEASURABLY WRONG on this population, in both
directions, which is the whole reason this file exists:
  · FALSE POSITIVE: packages/icon/jcon_tests/prepro.icn is a deliberate preprocessor-error fixture. One
    compile raises `$undef: too many arguments` AND five `";": missing right parenthesis`. A token rule files
    it as hq_B's work; no deletion of semicolons can ever make icont accept it, because the preprocessor
    errors are the point of the fixture.
  · FALSE NEGATIVE: the `"}": invalid case clause` shape is a trailing `;` before a case body's closing brace.
    icont names the BRACE, and the offending `;` is on the previous line. A token rule cannot see this shape
    at all, and it is 4 of the 18 real files.

⛔ EVERY DELETION IS AT A POSITION ICONT ITSELF FLAGGED. This tool never scans for semicolons it finds
suspicious; it asks the oracle where the error is and removes a `;` there. It NEVER writes to the corpus — it
copies the staged directory's symlinks into a private temp dir and replaces the one target with a real file,
because writing through a symlink would edit the shipped source it is supposed to be measuring.

⛔ PROGRESS IS MEASURED, SO THE LOOP TERMINATES ON ITS OWN and the cap is a backstop, not the mechanism: a
candidate deletion is accepted only if the oracle's first complaint MOVES FORWARD (a later line) or the total
number of complaints DROPS. A deletion that changes nothing, or makes things worse, is rejected and the file
is classified OTHER rather than hacked at.

    ⛔ THE `File` FIELD IS CHECKED, NOT ASSUMED. A `$line` directive REMAPS what icont reports — packages/icon/
    jcon_tests/tpp.icn compiles as `File a.b.c` and arizona_tests/general/tpp.icn as `File xyzzy`, with line
    numbers in the remapped space. Editing 'line 56' of the real file on the strength of a remapped report
    would delete a byte the oracle never complained about, which is the CEO-483 shape exactly: an instrument
    measuring something other than what it names. A remapped report yields NO candidates and the file falls to
    OTHER, which is where both tpp files belong anyway.

    ⛔⭐ THE MACRO-BODY FALLBACK IS NOT A HEURISTIC, IT IS THE ONLY WAY THIS CLASS IS VISIBLE AT ALL.
    packages/icon/jcon_tests/htprep.icn carries `$define SIGNATURE "<!-- ... -->";` at line 46 — ONE semicolon,
    inside a MACRO BODY. icont never reports line 46. It reports the three USE SITES (257 `";": missing then`,
    266 and 286 `";": missing right parenthesis`), each of which is a line with no semicolon on it at all, so a
    strictly line-local search finds no candidate and drops a genuinely deletion-repairable file into OTHER.
    Deleting that single byte makes icont accept the whole file — MEASURED. A trailing `;` on a `$define` is
    exactly the shape our conversion produces, and it detonates everywhere the macro is used and nowhere it is
    written, which is why it survived every earlier census.
