# GOAL CALLED THROUGH A VARIABLE CUTS BACK TO THAT CALL, AS ISO call/1 (7.8.3) REQUIRES (row prolog-a-cut-inside-a-control-

# RED BEFORE: G = (member(Y,[1,2,3]), (Y >= 2 -> ! ; true)), findall(Y, G, L) gave [1,2,3] in both modes (swipl [1,2]) and
# the length/2 generator form ran out of stack: the synthesized ,/2 ;/2 ->/2 default bodies meta-called each operand, so a
# cut beneath an if-then-else was local to one nested default activation. The cure: those defaults try '$cutcall'/2 first
# (after ,/2's own $fc clause), which compiles the goal once as the body of a fresh clause over its own variables and calls
# it, so the cut is that clause's own cut. ARMS cover the cut in a then branch, an else branch, a (C, ! ; E) arm, an unbounded
# generator, a forall, and the two that must NOT change: a cut inside \+ stays local, a cut-free goal keeps every answer.
# The ref is cut from swipl at run time; m3 and m4 must each equal it byte for byte. rc 0 GREEN, 1 RED, 2 REFUSED.
