# test_gate_pl_compiled_tables_refuse_a_mismatch.sh -- a mode-4 program's compiled atom table and functor table are installed into
# the runtime's interners at module_init, and an install whose leading rows disagree with what the runtime already interned must
# REFUSE (exit 2 with the message naming the row) rather than run a program whose ids mean different terms (R1.3, SCRIP cf3ed3dd5;
# the cto's review check 2026-09-27: "that mode 4's .Lpl_functor_tab install refuses rc 2 on a mismatch in a witness, not only in
# prose"; ARCH-PROLOG-BB-REWRITE.md section 3: the compiler interns, module_init registers the table with the one runtime interner).
#
# THE SHAPE, MEASURED. The runtime's prolog_atom_init interns five atoms (. [] true fail !) and the functor ./2 BEFORE the tables are
# installed, in the same order the compiler did, so the tables' leading rows must be exactly those. rt_pl_atom_table_install and
# rt_pl_functor_table_install re-intern every row in order and refuse when a row's id is not its index -- which fires exactly when a
# leading row is not what the runtime already holds. THE BOUNDARY, NAMED: a permutation of two LATER rows is self-consistent to the
# installer (each fresh pair takes the next id) and is NOT caught here -- it would mis-name terms, which the suites see, not this gate.
# MEASURED BEFORE THE CURE (SCRIP cf3ed3dd5): both swapped programs RAN, rc 0, printing mis-named terms ([b|g(1,g(2,[]))] and
# g(b,[](1,[](2,true)))) -- in mode 4 the install is the first Prolog act of the process, so the per-row check (id != index) could
# never fire. The cure: the functor install ends by running prolog_atom_init and refusing unless the five init atoms read ids 0..4 and
# ./2 reads functor 0 -- the order every compiled table carries by construction, because the compiler's parse begins with that init.
#
# METHOD: compile a witness with atoms and compounds to .s; (a) the pristine .s links and runs, its output equal to mode 3's;
# (b) the .s with the functor table's first two data rows swapped links and exits 2 naming the functor row; (c) the .s with the atom
# table's first pointer row swapped with its sixth exits 2 naming the atom row. REFUSE rc=2 when scrip, gcc or the tables are absent.
