# test_gate_xfail_has_reason.sh -- A REASONLESS XFAIL IS A RED, NOT A PASS (row xfail-entries-carry-a-
# reason-or-are-reds, minted by hq_T 2026-09-03; GOAL MASTER-PLAN I23). An xfail line with no stated WHY is
# indistinguishable from a red somebody hid, and the plan deliberately converts uncured reds into REASONED
# xfails by H+32 -- so this gate is what keeps a 100% cell from becoming exactly that trophy-cabinet number.
#
# MECHANISM: every corpus/tests/<lang>/ALL<ext> source (ext from the driver's own frontend list -- .sno
# .icn .pl .sc .reb .raku .pas) embeds a banner comment before each xfail entry: "<dashes> <rank> <entry>
# XFAIL", wrapped in whatever comment syntax that language uses (*, #, %, /* */, { }). corpus/tests/<lang>/
# ALL.xfail (when present) repeats the SAME banner line as a plain-text header, followed by reason prose,
# one block per xfail entry, until the next banner or EOF.
# ⛔ THIS GATE IS COMMENT-SYNTAX AGNOSTIC ON PURPOSE (byte-safe pattern over authored text, THE INSTRUMENT
# LAWS): it matches the core "-{3,} RANK ENTRY XFAIL" shape wherever it sits on a line, so it needs no
# per-language comment-char table and cannot silently under-count a language whose syntax it forgot.
# A reason "counts" if the prose block is non-empty and is not a bare placeholder token (todo/tbd/unknown/
# n/a/-/?/fixme, case-insensitive, matched against the WHOLE stripped block) -- no length floor beyond that:
# this project's own ALL.xfail already carries real reasons as short as one clause, and a length floor would
# reject those alongside the placeholders it exists to catch.
# OUT OF SCOPE, NAMED SO THE NEXT READER ISN'T SURPRISED: corpus/tests/icon/rung36_jcon_*.xfail is a
# DIFFERENT mechanism (one reason file per vendor JCON suite file, not per ALL.csv entry; born of the
# icon-jcon-suite-39 census row) and is not scored by any language's 100% cell -- left to that row's owner.
# EXIT 0 every XFAIL-banner entry found has a real reason; 1 at least one does not (named, by language); 2
# REFUSED (examined nothing -- corpus/tests absent, or truly zero XFAIL banners anywhere, too suspicious to
# certify as a silent pass).

# ⛔⭐⭐ A LANE LON HAS PARKED CANNOT HOLD THIS GATE RED, AND ITS GAPS STILL GET COUNTED AND NAMED (ceo ->
# hq_T 2026-09-05, OCTET: "THE ORDER OF WORK IS SNOBOL4, ICON AND PROLOG; Pascal, Raku, Rebus and Snocone
# rows stay PARKED-LON-HOLD"). Blocking on a parked lane teaches the reader to ignore a red gate, which is
# strictly worse than the gap it is reporting -- and dropping those entries would be the trophy-cabinet
# number this gate exists to prevent. So they are REPORTED: counted, named, never silent, never blocking.
# ⛔⭐ THE BRIEF SAID "177, ALL SNOCONE" AND THE MEASUREMENT SAYS OTHERWISE -- 182 gaps, 156 raku, 17
# snocone, 5 snobol4, 4 rebus. Those 5 snobol4 entries sit in the FIRST lane of the order of work, so
# reporting the whole population would have hidden live work in the active lane behind a parked-lane excuse.
# That is the entire reason this partitions instead of demoting the gate wholesale.
# ⛔⭐ THE ROSTER IS POLICY, NOT A MEASUREMENT, AND THERE IS NO MACHINE-READABLE AUTHORITY FOR IT: the
# order of work lives in the MODE file's PROSE header, and CLAUDE.md's standing rule is to read MODE's first
# line and NEVER its prose. A parser over that sentence would break on the next rewording and refuse a gate
# that had nothing wrong with it. So the roster is an explicit parameter -- and the mitigation for the
# hand-typed-population trap hq_I measured today (a gate that lifts its MAP correctly and then hand-types
# its ROSTER passes green over the roots it forgot) is that this gate PRINTS THE ROSTER IT USED on every
# run. A stale roster is then visible in the output of the thing it distorts, rather than silent. Override
# with XFAIL_ACTIVE_LANGS when Lon's order moves.
