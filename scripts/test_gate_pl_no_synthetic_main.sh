# Row prolog-directive-less-entries-run-main-but-the-oracle-does-not (ceo ruling 2026-09-02 19:55, CEO-152).
#
# THE DEFECT THIS PINS: lower_pl_stage2 carried an `ninit == 0 && main/0 exists -> run main` fallback, so a
# directive-less program that merely DEFINED main/0 was executed by SCRIP while `swipl -q -g halt` consults the
# file and halts, printing nothing. SCRIP agreed with the oracle on rc and disagreed on OUTPUT -- for EVERY
# directive-less program in the corpus, not only the five hq_C measured. A program that wants main says so.
#
# WHAT IT PROVES, in both directions so a silent compiler cannot pass it:
#   (a) DIRECTIVE-LESS defining main/0 -> prints NOTHING, exits 0, in m3 AND m4. This is the cure.
#   (b) WITH `:- initialization(main).` -> still prints and exits 0, in m3 AND m4. Without this arm the gate
#       would go green against a compiler that had simply stopped running anything at all.
#   (c) The oracle itself is asserted, not assumed: swipl prints nothing for (a) and prints for (b). If the
#       oracle ever disagrees, this REFUSES rather than grading SCRIP against a premise that has moved.
# ⛔ Hermetic: programs are written under mktemp, nothing in corpus/ is read or written.
