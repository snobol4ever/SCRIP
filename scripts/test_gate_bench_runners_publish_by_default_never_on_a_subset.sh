# test_gate_bench_runners_publish_by_default_never_on_a_subset.sh -- EVERY BENCH RUNNER PUBLISHES ITS ROW BY DEFAULT ON A WHOLE-POPULATION
# PASS, AND A FILTERED, SUBSET OR SCRATCH PASS NEVER WRITES (ceo CEO-1302 (a), 2026-09-27: "all seven bench runners publish their row by
# default on a whole-population pass by the admitted LANES runner ... A filtered or subset pass never writes. One convention; you land
# it."). Six runners wrote only under --write and Pascal's always wrote, so whether a pass published depended on the runner.
#
#   F   lib_bench_write.sh's bench_row_writes: the published directory graded whole -> 1; --no-write -> 0; kernels named -> 0; another
#       directory (a fixture) -> 0; a directory that does not resolve -> 0, never 1
#   S   all seven runners source lib_bench_write.sh and compute WRITE from bench_row_writes, every util_score_row.py write sits under
#       `if [ "$WRITE" = 1 ]`, and none sets WRITE from --write any more
#   R   the Rebus runner on a scratch population (BENCH_REBUS_DIR at a one-kernel copy) prints "row write: no" naming the scratch
#       directory and reaches no leaderboard write
# FAIL-ONCE, MEASURED 2026-09-27 (coo) against origin 32aab0723's seven runners in a scratch copy of scripts/ (this landing's lib kept so
# the gate reaches its arms): S red on all seven. R is an invariant, not a fail-once arm: the runners' own older guard (IS_BOARD,
# CEO-547) already kept a population outside the corpus from writing, and this landing keeps it so.
