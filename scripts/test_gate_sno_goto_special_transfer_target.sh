# test_gate_sno_goto_special_transfer_target.sh -- A RUN-TIME-RESOLVED GOTO TARGET MAY NAME A SPECIAL TRANSFER.
#
# WHAT THIS IS: the end state of row snobol4-a-by-name-goto-target-may-be-the-special-transfer-return
# (hq_P 2026-09-06, rank 0, co-signed hq_U). A SNOBOL4 goto whose target is chosen at RUN time may name one
# of RETURN / FRETURN / NRETURN and not only a user label. Published contract of gimpel STATEF.inc, whose
# every state function returns via `:(RET(label))` where `RET = .RETURN :(NRETURN)`: the NAME returned is
# RETURN, meaning "return from the state function", not "jump to a label called RETURN". Before the cure
# every arm below died `ERROR 038 -- transfer to undefined label: RETURN`.
#
# ⛔ THE ROW WAS WRITTEN FOR THE BY-NAME PATH AND THE DEFECT WAS WIDER, WHICH IS WHY ARM 1 IS HERE AT ALL:
# the PLAIN computed goto `:($WHERE)` with WHERE = 'RETURN' failed identically to the by-name form. Two
# lowering sites reach this -- sgoto()/sno_goto_target for `:($VAR)`, sno_goto_computed_target for the
# call form -- so a gate that pinned only the by-name arm would stay green while the commoner form was red.
#
# ⭐ ARM 3 IS THE CONTROL AND IT MUST STAY: a LITERAL `:(RETURN)` reached dynamically from a main-program
# label (fallen into from a DEFINE'd body) already worked before the cure and must keep working. It is the
# arm that proves the landing is ACTIVATION-DYNAMIC rather than lexical, so a future cure that binds RETURN
# to the graph it is written in reds here instead of passing.
#
# ⛔ WHAT THIS GATE DOES NOT CLAIM: that `:(RETURN)` with NO activation on the stack behaves. It does not --
# SCRIP dies on a signal (m3 SIGSEGV, m4 SIGILL) where SPITBOL raises ERROR 242 "function return from level
# zero". That is a separate, pre-existing defect with its own row
# (snobol4-literal-return-with-no-activation-segvs-where-the-oracle-raises-error-242, hq_S). Pinning it here
# would make this gate red for a defect it does not test.
#
# NON-VACUOUS BY CONSTRUCTION: SCRIP_GOTO_SPECIAL_TRANSFER=0 restores the pre-cure behaviour, and every arm
# below is RED under it. Prove that before trusting a green: SCRIP_GOTO_SPECIAL_TRANSFER=0 bash <this file>
#
# EXIT: 0 all arms match SPITBOL. 1 an arm regressed. 2 UNPROVEN (no built scrip / no oracle).
