# test_gate_sno_arbno_literal_body_then_fence_terminates.sh -- ARBNO(P) WHOSE BODY BEGINS WITH A LITERAL, FOLLOWED BY A FENCE(Q)
# THAT IS BACKTRACKED INTO, TERMINATES AND ANSWERS AS SPITBOL DOES (ceo 2026-09-30, found rewriting bootstrap/parser_raku.sc:
# `'a' ARBNO(' b') FENCE(' ' | '') RPOS(0)` on 'a b' -- sbl -bf says yes, ./scrip never returns; the same with FENCE(' ') -- sbl no,
# ./scrip never returns; two fences -- sbl yes, ./scrip never returns. ARBNO(FENCE(...)) and ARBNO((' ' | '') 'x') agree on both
# engines, so the shape is the LITERAL-FIRST body. The witness and its oracle-cut ref: scripts/fixtures/pattern/
# arbno_literal_body_then_fence.{sno,ref}. rc 0 both modes print the ref within the limit; rc 1 a diff or a timeout (the hang);
# rc 2 no binary.
# THE DEFECT (cfo 2026-09-30, measured under gdb on the fixture): FENCE1's beta handed its predecessor the backtrack with r14 where
# FENCE's BODY had left it, not where FENCE found it at alpha. Every predecessor beta reads r14 as the cursor it left at its own
# gamma: a literal subtracts its width from it, and a frameless ARBNO re-enters its body there and recedes until r14 equals its
# start -- from 2 against a start of 1, by steps of 2, so 0, -2, -4 ... and never back (the hang). The same stale cursor gives a
# wrong answer where the recede does land (C1, C2 below: SCRIP no, sbl yes). The literal-first body was the reported trigger,
# not the cause: ARBNO(LEN(2)), FENCE(LEN(1)), *P and a literal between ARBNO and FENCE all hung the same way.
# THE CURE: FENCE1 saves r14d at alpha beside its watermark and restores it at beta before the release (bb_match_fence1.cpp).
# ARM 2: scripts/fixtures/pattern/arbno_then_fence_cursor_class.{sno,ref}, the class -- the stale cursor's wrong answers, ARBNO
# through *P and through a literal, a FENCE body on the frame route (an alternation inside), and controls that never depended on
# the cursor. RED on the parent of the cure (b1cde82b2): both fixtures HANG in m3 and m4; the class prints C1 no, C2 no, then hangs at C3.
