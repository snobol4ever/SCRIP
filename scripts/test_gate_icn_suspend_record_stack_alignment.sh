# test_gate_icn_suspend_record_stack_alignment.sh -- an Icon procedure that SUSPENDS a record must behave
# exactly as the icont oracle does, in both modes.
#
# THE CLASS (hq_I 2026-09-06, row icon-ipl-parse-icn-coexpression-sigsegv-both-modes): the Icon generator
# call path pushes an ODD 8-byte word and never pads it, so the callee body is entered at rsp 0-mod-16 and
# every runtime helper it calls is entered 8 bytes off the SysV ABI's required alignment.
# bb_call_proc_staged.cpp emits, at every call_proc_staged site: a PL-CALL-ALIGN pad + the L(7) push (16
# bytes, parity-neutral, added by an earlier cure of THIS SAME CLASS for Prolog -- witness
# prolog-call-n-user-predicate-segfault), then under icn_gen_regime() ONLY a lone "N-2 STEP 3 REGION
# HAND-OFF" push (8 bytes, parity-FLIPPING), then the wire pair (16 bytes, parity-neutral), then jmp.
#
# ⛔ THE DEFECT IS LATENT, WHICH IS WHY IT READS AS A RECORD BUG AND IS NOT ONE. A misaligned rsp costs
# nothing until some callee executes an ALIGNED SSE store. Suspending a list or a string reaches no such
# callee and passes; suspending a RECORD reaches dat_construct -> rt_fire_buildplan_tweak, whose
# snprintf(proc, 256, "%s__TWEAK", ...) compiles to movaps and faults. MEASURED, not inferred: the faulting
# instruction is `movaps %xmm0,-0xc0(%rbp)` with si_code=SI_KERNEL(128) and si_addr=0x0, the signature of a
# misaligned SSE store rather than a bad pointer; entry rsp at rt_call_arr_bl is 0-mod-16 on the suspend
# path and the ABI-correct 8-mod-16 on the return path.
#
# ⛔ THE CONTROLS ARE THE POINT OF THIS GATE. icn_suspend_list_control and icn_coexpr_int_control are GREEN
# PRE-CURE and were verified green before being called controls (hq_B's standing condition, and hq_I's own
# correction from 2026-09-05: an arm that is red before the cure is a witness with a misleading name). They
# are equally misaligned -- they just never reach an SSE spill. So a "cure" that only makes records avoid
# rt_fire_buildplan_tweak would turn this gate green while leaving every other Icon generator call one
# unlucky callee away from the same crash. icn_return_record_control exonerates record construction itself.
#
# ⛔ A CURE DIRECTION ALREADY MEASURED WRONG, recorded so nobody re-walks it: padding the region-handoff push
# in place (sub rsp,8 between the lea and the push, keeping [entry rsp+16]) DOES fix every record witness and
# DOES restore 8-mod-16 -- and it breaks the co-expression path, which SIGSEGVs in scrip_coswitch ->
# rt_scan_state_capture -> malloc. Something in the region/wire contract depends on that exact distance.
# The omega-landing counterpart (16 -> 24) was measured to change nothing either way. Reverted whole; the
# tree this gate lands on is byte-identical to the pre-experiment tree.
#
# THE FIX BELONGS TO A SHARED NODE. bb_call_proc_staged.cpp is lowered to by Prolog, Icon and SNOBOL4, so a
# cure is authored by the lane whose language exposed it and CO-SIGNED by hq_U (RULES.md § shared node).
