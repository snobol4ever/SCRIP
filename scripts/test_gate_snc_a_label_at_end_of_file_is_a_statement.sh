# test_gate_snc_a_label_at_end_of_file_is_a_statement.sh -- A SNOCONE LABEL WITH NO STATEMENT AFTER IT IS A
# STATEMENT, NOT A SYNTAX ERROR (hq_I, row snocone-every-non-package-source-that-runs-with-output-absorbed-into-
# the-master-with-oracle-refs, 2026-09-13).
#
# MECHANISM, read off the grammar and not inferred: snocone_parse.y carried a label ONLY as a prefix of another
# statement -- matched_stmt had "label_decl matched_stmt" and unmatched_stmt had "label_decl unmatched_stmt", and
# there was no production in which a label stood alone. So "fin:" as the last line of a file left the parser
# waiting for the statement the label had to prefix, and the diagnostic landed on the line AFTER the last one:
# claws5.sc:138 in a 137-line file, treebank-append.sc:198 in 197, treebank-prepend.sc:194 in 193. All three end
# with "END:" -- the exit label their own "goto END;" jumps to, which is the idiom that cannot be written last.
# ⛔ THE EMPTY STATEMENT ALREADY EXISTED (simple_stmt: T_SEMICOLON), so "fin: ;" parsed and "fin:" did not -- two
# spellings of one construct disagreeing, which is what made this read as a typo in the corpus rather than a gap
# in the grammar. CURE (this commit): the two prefix productions are REPLACED by a single "matched_stmt:
# label_decl". That is semantically identical for the prefix case and not merely close to it -- sc_append_label_node
# already appends the label as its OWN STMT_t through sc_append_chain and never attaches it to the following
# statement, so "a: b = 1;" built the same two-node chain before this change and after it. Bison agrees: the
# grammar had ZERO conflicts before and has ZERO after, where simply ADDING "| label_decl" beside the prefix
# productions raises 37 shift/reduce -- the replacement is the conflict-free form and the addition is not.
#
# ⛔ THIS GATE CUTS NO REF AND TYPES NO EXPECTED OUTPUT, ON PURPOSE. Snocone has no rival implementation to cut
# one from (corpus/tests/snocone/PROVENANCE.md), and an authored ref here would be this seat grading its own
# opinion. Instead every arm is a TWIN DIFF against the spelling the compiler ALREADY accepted: "fin:" must behave
# byte-for-byte and rc-for-rc like "fin: ;". The control is the construct, not a number.
#
# ARMS: (1) m3 twin diff, trailing label vs explicit empty statement; (2) m4 twin diff, the same pair, because a
# parse cure that reached only one mode would still be a divergence; (3) the LIVE-TARGET arm -- a goto into the
# trailing label must skip the output between, so the label is proven to be a real jump target and not a node the
# parser accepted and dropped; (4) the three corpus kernels that opened the row must PARSE (their runtime state is
# other rows and is deliberately NOT graded here).
# FAIL-ONCE, MEASURED 2026-09-13 BY REBUILDING THE PRE-CURE BINARY (the .y and its generated .tab.c stashed
# together, make re-run, the two binaries verified distinct by md5 -- an A/B that does not prove that compared a
# build with itself): the gate exits NON-ZERO on the pre-cure build with "m3 FAIL (trailing label rc=1 out=
# bare.sc:4: snocone parse error: syntax error ... vs twin rc=0 out=one|two)". ⛔ THAT RUN ALSO FOUND A HOLE IN
# THIS GATE AND IT IS CURED HERE: arm 2 had refused rc=2 when EITHER twin failed to compile, so on the defective
# build it reported "measured nothing" and exited before arms 3 and 4 ran -- a gate that turns the very defect it
# grades into its own inability to measure. It now refuses only when the CONTROL twin cannot compile, and reads a
# control that compiles beside a bare form that does not as the FAILURE it is.
