# test_gate_pas_the_c_parser_builds_the_pruned_parse_tree.sh -- the C Pascal parser hands the lowerer the PRUNED PARSE TREE and nothing
# invented: one node per rule that fires, children in source order, the declared type kept as a child of its declaration, no desugaring
# (Lon 2026-10-03, in-chat to hq_snocone, verbatim: "The right shape can be decided not by me but by the RULE, in the same left to right
# order as source input, and built directly from Shift/Reduce and the Counter stack primitives ONLY ... It is a PRUNED PARSE TREE, it is
# not a FANCY SYNTAX TREE."; RULES.md FACT RULE -- THE TREE IS THE PRUNED PARSE TREE, its last bullet names hq_pascal for the C Pascal
# parser; the cto's ruling to hq_pascal 2026-10-09: "LEVER (2) NEEDS NOBODY'S WORD" and the tree conversion "does not wait on the speed phase").
#
# MEASURED 2026-10-09 by hq_pascal on SCRIP 86763386e, the cto's six-line program under --dump-ast: the parser DROPS the declared types and
# DESUGARS WITH THEM (a type checker lives in the parser): v := loc / 2 arrives as ADD(DIV(MUL(loc, FLIT 1), ILIT 2), FLIT 0); the globals
# get invented zero-init assignments and an arr_make call at the head of an invented PROC_DECL main under an invented STMT; writeln(r:6:2)
# becomes a __pas_writeln call with a -3 sentinel. Every one of those moves to lower_pascal.c (A PARSER MOVES NOTHING; THE LOWERER PLACES IT).
#
# ARMS over ONE program (the expectations are read from its SOURCE, never pasted from a dump): (1) no invented STMT wrapper; (2) no invented
# main procedure; (3) no builtin call the parser names (__pas_*); (4) no arr_make; (5) one TT_ASSIGN per := in the source (no invented zero-init
# assignments); (6) the / of the source is one DIV over its two source operands (no MUL-by-1.0, no ADD-0.0 coercion); (7) the declared types
# integer and real, and the array bounds, are in the tree; (8) the field widths of writeln(r:6:2) follow r in source order with no sentinel;
# (9) and (10) the program still prints what fpc -Miso prints, m3 and m4 (the cure moves meaning from the parser to the lowerer and may not change it).
# Arms (1) to (8) FAIL on 86763386e (that is the row's red); arms (9) and (10) are the behaviour the cure must keep, green on it. FAIL_ONCE=1 corrupts their ref.
