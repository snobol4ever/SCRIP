# util_icn_class_witness.sh -- ONE runnable, oracle-anchored acceptance witness per open hq_I Icon class row.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (ceo 19:02 2026-09-05, "placeholder-done-whens-in-your-lane-16-rows-unpickable"): sixteen FREE
# rows in the hq_I lane carried the MINT PLACEHOLDER as their DONE-WHEN, and since mint-dispatch-refuses-a-
# placeholder-done-when landed the picker will not serve them -- they were invisible work. Each row's DONE-WHEN
# is now one line, "bash scripts/util_icn_class_witness.sh <slug>", instead of sixteen bespoke heredocs that
# would drift apart the way the seven ladder copies did before lib_ladder.sh (ONE template, never N copies).
#
# CONTRACT: rc=0 the class is CURED (SCRIP matches the live icont oracle byte-for-byte in BOTH modes), rc=1 the
# class is LIVE (it diverges), rc=2 UNPROVEN (no oracle, no fresh binary, unknown slug, or a witness the oracle
# itself cannot build -- never printed as either answer). Grading is by VALUE against the oracle, never by rc:
# most of these classes abort at rc=0 or return a wrong answer at rc=0, so an exit-code check reads them clean.
#
# ⛔ EVERY WITNESS BELOW WAS PROVEN RED THE DAY IT WAS WRITTEN (hq_I 2026-09-05, SCRIP f3f8e252b). A slug that
# reads rc=0 here has been CURED since -- close its row, do not assume the witness rotted.
#
# ⛔ ONE SLUG SHIPS GREEN ON PURPOSE: icon-jcon-chained-swap-lvalue-not-handled reads rc=0 CURED today. It was
# red this morning (x :=: y :=: z aborted rc=134 on the bb_varslot_peek sink inside IR_SWAP's own case) and was
# cured by another lane in the interim. It is kept here as the standing regression witness, and it is the
# mixed variable/list-slot shape rather than the all-variable one BECAUSE the list slot is the operand that
# actually sank -- four shapes were graded before closing the row (3-way, 4-way, all-list-slot, mixed), all
# green in both modes, rather than closing on the first one that passed.
#
# ⭐ ONE WITNESS IS NOT A CLASS, AND THIS FILE EXISTS BECAUSE THAT NEARLY COST A LIVE ROW. The first cset-NUL
# witness written for this file, image(cset(char(0))), reads GREEN today -- and the row is NOT cured: the very
# next shape, cset(char(0) ++ "ab"), still drops the NUL member (oracle '\x00ab' size 3, SCRIP 'ab' size 2).
# Closing that row off the passing witness would have retired a live defect with a receipt saying it was fixed.
# Where a class has a passing neighbour, the witness here is the one that FAILS and the neighbour is kept
# beside it, so the next reader sees the boundary instead of rediscovering it.
#
# ⭐ IT HAPPENED A SECOND TIME IN THE SAME SITTING, which is why this is a rule and not an anecdote. The
# sortf witness first written here used the FOUR-element mix its row's own GOAL describes (two record types,
# a plain list, an integer) and read GREEN in both modes. Widening the same call to nine elements across nine
# types reads RED and badly -- the oracle sorts 7 3.5 "str" 'abc' list set table ra rb, SCRIP sorts
# 3.5 7 set table 'abc' list ra rb "str". A cross-type ORDER defect is invisible to any mix too narrow to
# contain the pair that is out of order, so a heterogeneous-compare witness must span types, not count them.
