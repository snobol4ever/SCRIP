# util_out_sweep.sh — per-program mode-3 RUN-OUTPUT md5 sweep, for behavioural blast-radius gates.
#   bash scripts/util_out_sweep.sh OUT.md5 [LISTFILE]        SCRIP=/path/to/scrip selects the arm
# The OUTPUT counterpart to util_s_md5_sweep.sh (which hashes --compile .s text and cannot see a runtime defect).
# Compare arms with:  diff A.md5 B.md5.  Row format:  <value>\t<path>  where value = md5 | RUN_RC_<rc> | RUN_FLAKY.
#
# ⛔ THIS IS THE INSTRUMENT s148 USED UNSOUNDLY AND s149 COULD NOT NAME (s149 NEXT-SEAT item 1).  NAMED AND FIXED
# HERE, s150, mechanism measured not guessed.  s148 saw "7 of 510 differ run-to-run under a FIXED .so" and split
# them into "5 already-crashing + 2 TIME() deltas".  Both halves are ONE root cause with TWO faces, and the second
# face is created BY THE SWEEP ITSELF:
#   (a) rc!=0 runs emit nondeterministic text (partial stdout + a crash message racing the flush), so hashing a
#       dead run manufactures movers.  Same s33 "non-empty is not alive" class util_s_md5_sweep.sh fixed at s149.
#   (b) ⛔ ELAPSED-TIME FIELDS TRACK MACHINE LOAD, SO ANY *PARALLEL* SWEEP IS SELF-POISONING.  Measured s150:
#       demo/calculator-1 and calculator-2 run SERIALLY are byte-identical to each other and stable across 3 runs
#       (md5 fd95ab76); run under `xargs -P $(nproc)` they take TWO different md5s, match NEITHER serial value, and
#       SWAP with each other between runs -- which reads exactly like cross-contamination and is not.  Root cause
#       proven by diffing the text, not the hash: `match_ms=0` serial vs `match_ms=1` under load, stdout otherwise
#       byte-identical.  demo/snobol4/json/json.sno is the same shape (`match_ms=`, TIME() at :273/:275) and was likewise a
#       FALSE mover in the s150 CN-8 A/B -- serially it is 8d262c4d on BOTH arms.
# CURE, faces (a)+(b): rc is recorded and a failed run is labelled RUN_RC_<rc> (stable in both arms, never hashed);
# and every elapsed-time field is normalised to a constant BEFORE hashing, which makes the sweep parallel-safe
# instead of merely parallel-fast.  ⛔ NORMALISE, DO NOT EXCLUDE: dropping the programs would blind the sweep to
# real defects in exactly the demos (json, calculator) that exercise the biggest pattern graphs in the corpus.
#
# ⛔ FACE (c) — AN INTERMITTENT CRASH DEFEATS FACES (a) AND (b) AT ONCE, AND READS AS A MOVER IN EITHER DIRECTION
# (seat1 s170, routed as queue row `sweep-false-mover-defence`; cured here s185/seat2).  Witness:
# `crosscheck/patterns/141_pat_eval_double_fn_arbno` is m3 rc=0 run serially and an INTERMITTENT load-dependent
# rc=139 under a parallel sweep.  Face (a)'s cure is not a cure here — the LABEL is what moves (an md5 in one arm,
# RUN_RC_139 in the other), and WHICH arm draws which is a coin flip, so a single-sample sweep manufactures a
# mover in EITHER direction and the direction reads as a win or as a regression AT RANDOM.  Face (b) cannot see it
# either: a run that dies never reaches its elapsed-time fields.  A timeout under load (rc=124) is the same shape.
# CURE (c): ⭐ THE SWEEP IS ITS OWN CONTROL ARM.  Every program is sampled REPS times (default 3) across REPS FULL
# PASSES — full passes, NOT REPS back-to-back runs inside one xargs slot, because the defect is LOAD-dependent and
# back-to-back samples share one load draw.  All REPS samples equal ⇒ that value.  Not equal ⇒ `RUN_FLAKY`, a
# VALUE-FREE label that is stable in both arms, so a diff cannot manufacture a mover from it.  Value-free is the
# load-bearing part: a label carrying the distinct-sample COUNT would itself move (2 in one arm, 3 in the other).
# ⛔ THE DEFENCE DOES NOT BLIND THE SWEEP.  It suppresses ONLY the both-arms-flaky case, which is the only
# false-mover case.  Flaky-in-A but stable-in-B still DIFFERS (RUN_FLAKY vs md5) and still reads as a mover — and
# that is correct, because an arm that CREATES or CURES nondeterminism is a real finding.  Same doctrine as
# NORMALISE-DO-NOT-EXCLUDE above, and the pin file is a DECLARATION, NEVER AN EXCLUSION: pinned programs are still
# run REPS times and still compared; the pin only decides whether a flake prints as `pinned` or as `⛔ NEW`.
# ⛔ REPS=1 DISARMS FACE (c) and says so on stderr.  Cost measured s185, 583 programs, 16 cpus, SCRIP ffbc1425:
# REPS=1 2.5s · REPS=3 7.4s — the whole defence is ~5s, which is why it is ON BY DEFAULT and not an opt-in flag.
# NEGATIVE TEST: `scripts/test_gate_out_sweep_flaky.sh` injects a flaky arm and asserts all three behaviours — the
# false mover REPRODUCED at REPS=1 in BOTH directions, CAUGHT at REPS=3, and a genuinely-moved program still read
# as a mover at REPS=3.  ⛔ Run it after ANY edit to this file; a defence with no negative test is a claim.
