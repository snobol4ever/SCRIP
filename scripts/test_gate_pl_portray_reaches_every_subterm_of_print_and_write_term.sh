# hq_prolog 2026-09-25, CEO-1270. THE DEFECTS: print/1 consulted portray/1 at the top term only (print(A) :- portray(A) -> true ; writeq(A)), so
# print(a(foo)) printed a(foo) where the hook doubles foo; print/2 never consulted it; write_term refused portrayed(true) with domain_error; and
# predicate_property(portray(_), dynamic / multifile) failed where portray/1 is predeclared. THE CURE routes all three writers through format's ~p,
# the C writer path that already calls portray/1 on every subterm from a plain leaf (lower_prolog.c pl_cc_print_via_format; write_term takes it when
# its option list is known at compile time to be portray/portrayed(true), optionally with numbervars(true)). Calling the hook from write_term's own
# context-carrying leaf re-entered Prolog and corrupted its trail (SIGSEGV in rt_pl_tr_unwind) -- measured, and not the route taken. A portray/1
# THROW now propagates (plc_portray_hit takes the pending ball; ~p raises it), which closes the named gap in
# test_gate_pl_print_1_honours_portray_and_costs_nothing_without_it.sh. NO MONITOR BRACKET: output divergences, compared line for line with swipl.
# RED BEFORE on origin, m3 AND m4: seven of eight lines.
