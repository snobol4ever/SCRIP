# lib_declared_arena.sh -- THE ONE READER OF A TEST'S DECLARED ARENA, for every runner that is not the
# Python harness. Source it; never copy a line of it (RULES.md, lib_* are SOURCED AUTHORITIES).
#
# ⛔⭐⭐ WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL. Lon, 2026-09-23, in-chat to the ceo, verbatim: "Well, each test should have
# the needed amount of memory in the attribute TSV/CSV files." (routed CEO-1167). Before that word, a
# program whose live set did not fit the shipped window was a capacity red and an argument for raising the
# default for EVERYBODY. After it, the program DECLARES what it needs, in KB, in its suite's ALL.csv, and
# the runner exports SCRIP_HEAP_KB FOR THAT PROGRAM ONLY. corpus_suite_harness.py reads the same column
# through heap_declarations(); eight package runners execute programs directly and cannot call it, which is
# exactly how one question gets nine written answers. It gets one here.
#
# ⛔ A DECLARATION IS NOT A PIN. A pin is a runner or a gate deciding an arena for a program from the
# outside; util_arena_pin_census.py hunts those and has since CEO-1146. A declaration is the TEST saying
# what it needs, carried in the test's own attribute row, reviewable in a diff, and carried forward across
# every rebuild by both suite builders. The census learns the column so the two are told apart by evidence
# rather than by which file the number happens to sit in.
#
# ⛔⭐⭐ THE FLOOR IS NOT A STYLE RULE AND IT IS THE ONE THING A READER OF THIS FILE MUST NOT "TIDY AWAY".
# src/runtime/rt/gc_heap.c:
#     cap_kb = (long)GC_HEAP_CAP_KB; if (cap_kb < kb) cap_kb = kb;
# with #define GC_HEAP_CAP_KB 4096. So SCRIP_HEAP_KB moves the INITIAL WINDOW always, and the HARD CAP only
# once it climbs past 4096. MEASURED by the coo 2026-09-23, one binary, one 60000-element Icon witness:
#     SCRIP_HEAP_KB=128  -> rc=134, runtime prints "THE CAP IS 4096 KB"
#     SCRIP_HEAP_KB=2048 -> rc=134, runtime prints "THE CAP IS 4096 KB"
#     SCRIP_HEAP_KB=4096 -> rc=134, runtime prints "THE CAP IS 4096 KB"
#     SCRIP_HEAP_KB=4097 -> rc=134, runtime prints "THE CAP IS 4100 KB"   <- the cap moves here, not before
#     SCRIP_HEAP_KB=8192 -> rc=0
# A cell reading 2048 therefore declares NOTHING ABOUT CAPACITY -- the program it names reaches 4096 KB with
# or without it -- while reading to every downstream consumer exactly like a capacity declaration. That is
# the pin-the-runtime-silently-overrides class COO-151 caught one instrument ago, and the baton's own
# guardrail (matched at that arena, NOT matched one step below) is UNPROVABLE for such a cell: one step
# below carries the same cap, so both arms read the same and the evidence is vacuous. Refused, loudly, rc=2.
# ââ­â­ THE RULE, IN THE READER'S OWN HEADER ON THE ceo'S INSTRUCTION:
#     A DECLARATION IS A NUMBER ABOVE THE COMPILED CAP OR IT IS NOT A DECLARATION (ceo CEO-1171, 2026-09-23, ruling on the coo's ask).
# Verbatim from the ruling: "A heap_kb cell at or below 4096 moves the initial window and not the cap,
# so it declares nothing about capacity while reading to every consumer as if it did -- the pin-that-
# the-runtime-overrides class, and your own guardrail (matched at that arena, not matched one step
# below) is vacuous for it by construction. Refusing rc=2 with that sentence is the loud direction;
# warn-and-pass would mint the false label CEO-1101 exists against."
# â SO THE FLOOR BELOW IS NOT A LOCAL CHOICE AND MAY NOT BE SOFTENED TO A WARNING. It was asked
# for as a ruling rather than taken as one, because refusing is criterion-shaped and criterion-writing
# is not the instruments seat's verb; the answer came back as law and is cited here at the constant it
# governs, so a reader who reaches for the number reaches the rule in the same glance.
# ⛔⭐⭐ CEO-1171's "above the compiled cap or not a declaration" rule is RETIRED (Lon 2026-09-25, in-chat to the ceo, verbatim: "Ensure that all the test suite programs have the stack size and heap size setting placed into the per-program attribute files."; ceo CEO-1261): every program declares its settings, a
# declaration equal to the default is a setting, not a no-op, and heap_kb is the program's MAXIMUM heap (SPITBOL -d), applied as
# SCRIP_HEAP_CAP_KB or -d<kb>k, never as the initial window -- the window stays SPITBOL's -i1m, or the tiny arena of `make test-arena`.
DECLARED_ARENA_CAP_KB=131072        # gc_heap.c #define GC_HEAP_CAP_KB (SPITBOL -d128m)
DECLARED_ARENA_MIN_KB=1024          # gc_heap.c #define GC_HEAP_KB: a maximum below the initial window is refused
DECLARED_ARENA_MAX_KB=4194304       # 4096*1024, the ceiling SCRIP_HEAP_KB itself refuses past
_LDA_HERE="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"

# declared_arena_kb <all_csv> <entry>
#   Echoes the declared KB for <entry>, or NOTHING when the file, the column or the cell is absent --
#   and "nothing" is the shipped default, which is the honest answer and never an error. Returns 2 and
#   echoes nothing on a cell that is present but unusable, so a caller that tests the exit code gets a
#   refusal and a caller that only reads stdout gets the default. ⛔ NOT a grep: the column's index is read
#   from the header every time, because a positional read is the defect that put heap_kb in seven feature
#   denominators the hour it landed (util_feature_coverage_census.py, cured in the same landing).

# ⭐ THE DECLARATION AS SWITCHES (row instruments-ninety-two-scripts-and-the-makefile-size-the-arena-through-the-env-not-the-d-switch;
# CEO-1225/1226: SCRIP sizes the heap with -d and -i and the stack with -s, as SPITBOL does, and a switch is recorded with the run where
# an environment knob is invisible in a transcript). These print the words a runner puts on its OWN scrip command line -- after --run
# for mode 3, leading the compiled binary's arguments for mode 4 -- spelled exactly as corpus_suite_harness.py's _size_switches spells
# them: a declared heap is the program's maximum heap (-d<kb>k; ceo CEO-1261 -- never -i, which would override the tiny arena of GC
# testing), a declared stack is -s<kb>k, nothing declared prints
# nothing. test_gate_declared_arena_switches_agree_with_the_harness.sh holds the two spellings together. MEASURED 2026-09-24: every
# heap_kb declared in the corpus is 8192 KB or more, where -d/-i and the old SCRIP_HEAP_KB export read the same window AND the same cap.

# command line (after --run, before the source) or at the head of a compiled binary's own command line -- the form CEO-1225 chose over
# an environment knob because a switch is recorded with the run. Echoes nothing when neither sidecar exists (the shipped defaults, the
# honest answer) and rc 2 on a sidecar the reader refuses. ⛔ NEVER SCRIP_HEAP_KB: gc_heap.c:218 reads that variable as the INITIAL
# WINDOW, so a declaration equal to the 131072 KB default cap exported through it would hand a benchmark a 128 MB window and a collector
# that never runs. ⛔ WHY (ceo CEO-1281, 2026-09-26): the Prolog benchmark angles ran scrip --run <k>.pl with no declaration at all while
# the suite runner honoured the sidecars, so tak overflowed the shipped 4 MB stack inside angle 1's own correctness gate and was SKIPped
# on every engine -- an instrument gap printed in a kernel finding's words. MEASURED the same sitting: tak(18,12,6) completes at
# -s65536k and overflows at -s32768k in both modes; swipl needs 16 MB of its own (--stack-limit=8m overflows too), so the need is the
# program's choice points and the declaration is the cure, never a raised default (Lon 2026-09-25: every program declares its stack and
# heap; Lon 2026-09-26: the command-line arguments a test unit needs, compile time and run time, are stored with the test unit).
