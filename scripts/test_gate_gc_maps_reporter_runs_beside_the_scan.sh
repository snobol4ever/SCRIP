# test_gate_gc_maps_reporter_runs_beside_the_scan.sh -- F6 STEP 3: THE WALKER AS A REPORTER, BEHIND SCRIP_GC_MAPS=1.
# ⭐ WHAT STEP 3 IS FOR (ARCH-GC-COMPILE-TIME-FRAME-MAPS.md section 7 F6, ceo CEO-867): the conservative scan --
# gc_zeta_frame, cons_stack, rt_cas_live_span and the heap-interior sniff, CENSUS conservative total=13 (24 until 2026-09-19: the cas-span byte scan and its gc_zeta_frame call went with the blob static layout, then 21 -> 13 the same day when the seven coexpression sweeps became typed visits and one segment walk, cto) -- may only be
# DELETED once a census says the typed walk and the sniff agree. This gate is that census. It walks every range the
# conservative scan walks, classifies each 16-byte cell TWICE (by the DESCR type tag alone, which is the frozen design's
# only tag; and by whether the sniff would take it), and counts the two divergence directions per POPULATION.
# ⛔ THE POPULATIONS ARE SPLIT ON PURPOSE AND A FLAT TOTAL IS A LIE: walking BY TYPE is only meaningful where every cell
# really is a DESCR. Over the C stack (pop=cstack) and over a whole seam-to-top span (pop=seam) the `v` byte is whatever
# happens to be there, so map_only there is the INSTRUMENT over-reading, not a defect. Measured flat first and it read
# divergence=79543 -- a number that means nothing. Split, it says exactly which population is measurable.
# ⭐ THE ARM THAT IS A REAL MEASUREMENT TODAY IS sniff_only == 0: the conservative sniff never visits a cell the type tag
# rejects, i.e. it does not rewrite non-pointers. That is one of the two divergence directions the plan names, and it is
# ZERO on both a SNOBOL4 and an Icon witness. This gate RATCHETS it so a later change cannot reintroduce the other kind.
# ⛔ map_only IS NOT YET A MEASUREMENT and this gate does not pretend otherwise: it needs the per-slot (offset, kind) map
# from the emitter to know which cells are slots at all. That is the emitter's row, not this one. Printed, never graded.
# ⛔ AND THE REPORTER MUST NOT CHANGE THE COLLECTOR: arm 1 requires byte-identical program output and ZERO [GC-MAPS]
# lines with the knob off, so a reporter that perturbs the run fails before its numbers are read.

# ⭐ ARM 7 (cto 2026-09-19, CTO-89; RE-MEASURED AND RE-ATTRIBUTED 2026-09-20, CTO-95): THE SPINE CURES, AND WHAT THE
# RESIDUAL ACTUALLY IS. The first cure was x86_xfer_enter's raw push of r13 (the match subject) around a deferred *F()
# entry, now two tagged DESCR cells ({DT_S, r15d, r13} and {DT_I, 0, r14}); the witness stayed red after it and the
# reading behind that was the real defect -- rt_match_enter parks the subject base in the C global Σ, c_rt_defer_close
# matched with strncmp(Σ + delta, ...) after the callee's collection slid the subject, and Σ was no root at all. Σ takes
# one typed visit. The cfo's C-to-BB entry glue took the same cure (bb_glue_flat.cpp, 48 bytes to 64). This arm holds
# both under the tiny arena: each witness answers as its oracle in both media at stress 1, and no collection whose floor
# is an emitted return poll (s_words <= 80; the by-name C-entry poll's floor sits under ~109 words of C frames and is
# the step-4 residual, printed not graded) reads MORE untagged heap words on the spine than the RATCHET.
# ⛔ THE RATCHET IS 1 AND THE OLD 2 NAMED A SITE THAT CANNOT RUN. The 2 was the two live save records above; both are
# cured, and the comment credited the second to "the match head's stfh record at HKQ(1)" -- code in the UNREACHABLE half
# of bb_match_begin(), which returned out of a bare block before it (92 lines, deleted CTO-95, emission byte-identical
# over every benchmark, demo, prolog and icon artifact). What the reporter names TODAY is a different class and it is
# NOT a live save: on hb_defer_subject.sno the single word at off=-120 is the value pointer left by bb_assign_global's
# mon-var tap (push rax/rax/rdi/rsi/rdx/... around comm_var), ALREADY POPPED -- a carved-but-unwritten spine slot still
# holding it. MEASURED DEAD, not argued: with a read watchpoint and a write watchpoint on that address at the collection,
# the first touch afterwards is a WRITE (runtime, then emitted code) and there is never a READ; on
# hb_nested_match_outer_subject.sno the deepest site (-784) is never touched again at all. A dead word is not visited and
# is not read, so the typed walk is correct over it -- but the instrument cannot tell dead from live, so 0 IS NOT
# REACHABLE BY CURING SAVE RECORDS and must not be written as the E switch's licence. ⛔ WHAT THIS ARM HOLDS: no NEW raw
# push of a heap pointer appears on a graded collection. A cure lowers the ratchet only after the same read-watchpoint
# experiment shows the word it removes was LIVE.
