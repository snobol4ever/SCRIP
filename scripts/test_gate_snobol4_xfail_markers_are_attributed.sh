# test_gate_snobol4_xfail_markers_are_attributed.sh — every surviving XFAIL marker in the SNOBOL4
# master must NAME A LIVE ROW, so that "expected to fail" always carries a route to a cure.
#
# ⛔ WHY THIS GATE EXISTS (hq_P 2026-09-06, row snobol4-every-xfail-fixed-as-a-faulty-test-or-cured-
# as-a-defect; CEO-328 (4) asked the question in prose and nobody could run it). Measured at the time
# of writing: of 32 markers, 6 named a live row, 3 named a row that was never minted, and 23 named NO
# ROW AT ALL -- they cite a FINDING and the words "Known, still open". ⭐ A FINDING IS A RECORD, NOT A
# ROUTE: under Lon's THERE IS NO XFAIL ruling, a marker whose text names no row leaves its reader with
# no way to reach the work, and it is invisible to every board because it is, by construction, expected.
# ⛔ THAT IS A STATEMENT ABOUT THE MARKER'S TEXT, NOT ABOUT WHETHER ANYONE OWNS THE DEFECT -- see the
# double-banner note below before you act on a single number from this gate.
#
# ⛔⭐ THE POPULATION IS ALL.csv's xfail COLUMN, AND v1 OF THIS GATE GOT THAT WRONG. It read ALL.xfail
# as the population, which makes the WORST case structurally invisible: an entry marked xfail with NO
# reason recorded at all is simply not in the file, so the gate counts a smaller, cleaner census and
# passes over exactly the entries nobody can act on. Caught within the hour of landing v1, on corpus
# f1e0cb251: csv=34 against reasons=32, the two extras (bal_arb_keyword_branch_1,
# user_function_keyword_branch_3) arriving from a ladder rung with no reason text at all. ⭐ AN
# INSTRUMENT THAT TAKES ITS DENOMINATOR FROM THE SAME FILE IT IS GRADING CANNOT SEE WHAT IS MISSING
# FROM THAT FILE -- the denominator must come from the other side. Its sibling
# test_gate_xfail_marker_and_index_agree.sh MEASURES this as REASONS_MISSING=2 and still exits 0.
#
# ⛔ REPORTED, NOT BLOCKING, ON PURPOSE: it is RED today (28 of 34 carry no usable route; the other 6 name a live row, but only in prose). It is wired into `make test`
# with a leading `-` exactly like test_gate_no_xfail_survives.sh, and the ramp to blocking is a
# ceo/Lon date decision, not a script author's.
#
# ⭐ SIX ARMS NEGATIVE-TESTED AT LANDING, because a gate that cannot fail is the trap this row is
# about: rc=1 real tree · rc=2 missing QUEUE.tsv · rc=2 QUEUE parsing to zero rows · rc=2 missing
# ALL.csv · rc=2 ALL.csv with no xfail column · rc=0 on a synthetic tree where all 32 reasons name a
# live row. Re-run them with `bash scripts/util_xfail_attribution_gate_arms.sh` -- they are cheap, and
# they are the only thing standing between this gate and the skip-as-success class it exists to expose.
#
# ⛔⛔ READ THE OUTPUT AS "UNRESOLVABLE BY NAME", NEVER AS "UNOWNED" -- THE AUTHOR OF THIS GATE MADE
# EXACTLY THAT MISREADING AND WAS ONE COMMAND FROM MINTING THREE DUPLICATE ROWS INTO ANOTHER HQ'S LANE.
# The 23 ARE owned: six snobol4-xfail-class-* rows cover this population, and each re-derives its own
# membership with its own bespoke grep over the marker prose (hq_T's fuzz row closes on
# `grep -ciE "fz_|fuzz"`). No marker names its row and no row lists its entries, so the join is prose
# and is invisible from both ends -- that is the defect, not an absence of rows. ⭐ A gate that answers
# "does this string appear in QUEUE.tsv" cannot answer "is this defect owned", and it has no way to
# say so. See FINDING-2026-09-06-hq_P-23-of-32-snobol4-xfail-markers-name-no-live-row-... (the filename
# is the claim that turned out to be wrong; it is kept because the correction is the finding).
#
# ⛔ WHAT THIS GATE DOES NOT CLAIM: that an attributed marker is CORRECT, or that its row is the right
# row. It grades ROUTING ONLY. A marker pointing at a live row it has nothing to do with passes here
# and is still wrong -- that is a different question and needs a different instrument.
