"""util_suite_population_diff.py -- A SKIP THAT MOVES IS A RED, IN EITHER DIRECTION (coo, CEO-824, 2026-09-17;
row instruments-a-skip-count-change-between-batches-is-a-red-not-a-silent-population-change; the cfo's escalation).

THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS FOR, MEASURED.  A suite entry that SKIPs leaves the GRADED population with no red anywhere:
the pass count falls and nothing points at why.  The SNOBOL4 master read m4_pass=1970 m4_skip=0 at SCRIP ad0f85fae
and m4_pass=1967 m4_skip=3 at b12714737 -- and that landing's own commit said "equal to base program for program"
while its board wrote SCORE's SnoM row on that tree.  The three were cured at 0567ad829 and read skip=0 again at
a861648ab.  BOTH the appearance and the disappearance passed unremarked, because every reader compared PASS.

A SKIP IS NOT A RED AND NOT A PASS; IT IS THE DENOMINATOR MOVING.  Three programs that stop being graded lower the
pass count exactly like three regressions, and raise it again exactly like three cures, and no verdict in the ladder
fires either way.  So this instrument compares the two things nobody compares: THE SKIP COUNTS and THE GRADED
DENOMINATOR.  It is a comparison and a verdict, never a new measurement -- corpus_suite_harness.py already prints
m3_skip/m4_skip on its SUITE_BOARD line, and this reads what the runner printed.

  rc=0  GREEN -- every skip count and every denominator field identical between the two readings.
  rc=1  RED   -- a skip count or a denominator moved, in EITHER direction, with the fields named and, where the
                 readings carry per-entry lines, THE ENTRIES NAMED on both sides.
  rc=2  REFUSED -- a file missing, no SUITE_BOARD line in it, or the two lines are not two readings of ONE suite
                 (different family, or a shard against a full board).  Comparing two different populations is not a
                 comparison, and printing a number for it would be worse than printing nothing.

WHY IT WILL NOT NAME THE ENTRIES FROM A BOARD LINE ALONE, AND SAYS SO.  The SUITE_BOARD line carries counts, not
names.  The harness prints its non-PASS entries on stderr (SUITE_LIST_ALL=1 for all of them), so when the reading
handed here is the runner's FULL output the skip entries are named on both sides and the appearing/disappearing sets
are printed.  When it is the board line alone the instrument says the entries are NOT NAMED and why, rather than
implying a set it never saw.
