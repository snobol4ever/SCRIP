"""util_finding_fold_before_delete.py -- FOLD A FINDING'S MEASURED CLAIMS INTO ITS LIVE CITERS BEFORE IT IS DELETED.

WHY THIS EXISTS (RULES.md line 31, Lon 2026-09-18 in-chat to the cto, verbatim: "You can use as many FINDING files as
you want. I'll just delete them periodically. We should probably do a summarization when I delete."; ceo CEO-859/861).
A measurement that lives only in a FINDING is a measurement with a deletion date: 2231 FINDING paths have already been
deleted from .github and two live rows were blocked on them this week.

THE QUESTION THE cto PUT IN THE BATON'S ## QA AND THIS TOOL'S ANSWER: automatic prose extraction is unreliable on a
file whose value is an argument rather than a table, and a script that PARAPHRASES a measurement has manufactured a
claim.  So this tool NEVER paraphrases.  It copies CLAIM LINES VERBATIM, and the INVARIANT the gate enforces is not
"the tool wrote the fold" but "the fold block contains lines that are verbatim in the FINDING" -- which a hand-written
seat summary satisfies just as well, and an empty marker or a paraphrase does not.  Automation is the default offer;
the verbatim-subset test is the law.

THE CLAIM-LINE RULE, PRINTED RATHER THAN IMPLIED (a reader must be able to predict what this copies):
  a CLAIM LINE is a line of the FINDING that contains at least one DIGIT, is at least MIN_CLAIM_CHARS characters long
  after markdown decoration is stripped, is not a heading, not a table rule, and not the file's own title line.
A FINDING with ZERO claim lines cannot be folded automatically and --apply REFUSES rc=2 rather than writing an empty
fold block, because an empty fold that satisfies a marker check is this instrument's own vacuous-green disease.

THE MARKER IS TERMINATED AND THE WINDOW IS NEVER GENEROUS -- this is CEO-860's lesson applied before it bites again:
a root digest and a GOAL cursor write ONE PARAGRAPH PER LINE, so any line-count window degrades into a five-thousand
character window that exempts whatever happens to be nearby.  The fold block is delimited by an explicit END marker
and is located by CHARACTER OFFSET, not by lines; an UNTERMINATED block is RED, never "close enough".

REFUSES rc=2 RATHER THAN PASSING VACUOUSLY: an unreadable tree, a tree with no FINDING files indexed, or a citation
scan that read zero files.  A zero from a tool that read nothing is not a zero.
