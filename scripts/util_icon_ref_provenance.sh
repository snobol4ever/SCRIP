# util_icon_ref_provenance.sh -- WHERE DID THIS PACKAGE'S REFS COME FROM?  Asked of the declared oracle, per
# program, with a printed denominator.  (hq_T, CEO-395 rule 3 + CEO-445 item 1, 2026-09-09.)
#
#     bash scripts/util_icon_ref_provenance.sh jcon_tests
#     bash scripts/util_icon_ref_provenance.sh arizona_tests --names
#
# ⛔ THE QUESTION IS NOT "DOES SCRIP PASS".  It is the one CEO-395 rule 3 asks one level above the board: a ref
# proves the answer has not MOVED; only its PROVENANCE says it agreed with anything else.  Icon's oracle is
# Arizona icont/iconx and nothing else (CEO-391 rule 1: one oracle per language, no compatibility switch).  So
# for every program with a ref, this runs the Arizona oracle the way the suite runner runs SCRIP -- same .dat /
# .args sidecars, same `link` modules, stdout only -- and asks whether the oracle reproduces the ref it is
# being graded against.  Three answers, and each is actionable by a different person:
#
#   ORACLE_REPRODUCES  the ref and the declared oracle agree. A red here is ours.
#   ORACLE_DIFFERS     the ref is NOT the declared oracle's output. Every verdict against it -- red OR GREEN --
#                      is a statement about a different implementation. ⭐ THE GREENS ARE THE WORSE HALF: a red
#                      gets looked at, a green against a foreign ref is a defect nobody will ever open.
#   ORACLE_REFUSES     the oracle will not compile it: OUTSIDE THE BASELINE (CEO-391 rule 2), never hidden,
#                      never silently passed, and out of the graded denominator with the oracle's own words.
#
# ⛔⭐ THE NONDETERMINISM ARM IS NOT OPTIONAL, AND A CONTROL RUN IS WHAT PROVED IT.  The first version of this
# census had no such arm, and its jcon reading (59 reproduce / 19 differ) looked damning on its own.  Running
# it against arizona_tests -- whose refs ARE upstream Arizona's, so nearly all of them must reproduce -- gave
# 81/8/1, and the 8 shared names with the jcon list (io, kwds, recent, fncs...) said plainly that some part of
# "differs" was the program, not the ref.  ⭐ A CENSUS WITH NO POSITIVE CONTROL CANNOT TELL A FINDING FROM ITS
# OWN METHOD.  So every DIFFERS candidate is re-run under the oracle a second time, and one that does not
# reproduce ITSELF is reported NONDETERMINISTIC and never counted as a provenance verdict -- the oracle cannot
# be evidence about a ref it does not agree with either.
#
# EXIT: 0 census printed · 2 REFUSED (no oracle, no package, or zero programs examined -- a runner that
# measured nothing never prints the success shape).
