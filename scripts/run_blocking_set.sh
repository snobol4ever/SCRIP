#!/usr/bin/env bash
# run_blocking_set.sh -- RUN EVERY ARM OF THE BLOCKING SET, THEN REPORT.  The loop-and-report driver behind
# `make test`, ruled CEO-582 (2026-09-11) on the cfo's first full census of that target.
#
# THE DEFECT IT EXISTS TO KILL, MEASURED BEFORE IT WAS BUILT: `make test` was ONE target of ~150 recipe
# lines and make ABORTS ON THE FIRST FAILING LINE, so when arm 15 went red the set died 24 seconds in and
# 131 ARMS NEVER EXECUTED -- for all 13 seats, for as long as that arm stayed red.  Not red.  Not green.
# UNMEASURED, which our own denominator law names the worst of the three states.  `make -k` does not rescue
# it (measured, 149s, same single red): -k continues across TARGETS, never across the lines of ONE recipe.
# The set could therefore only ever reveal ONE red per cure cycle, each cycle paying a build.  The cfo's
# loop-and-continue census found EIGHT non-green where the target reported ONE -- five reds and three
# refusals, one of which would have passed VACUOUSLY.  WE REPORTED 1 OF 8.
#
# ⛔ THE GUARDS, all from the ruling and all mandatory -- nothing here is weakened relative to abort-first:
#   · the exit code stays NON-ZERO whenever a blocking arm is red (rc=1) or refused (rc=2);
#   · REDS AND REFUSALS ARE PRINTED AS SEPARATE CLASSES, never summed, because rc=1 FAILED and rc=2
#     COULD-NOT-MEASURE are different facts and the second is the better hiding place;
#   · the summary SATISFIES ITS OWN DENOMINATOR -- green + red + refused == arms, printed, and the driver
#     REFUSES rc=2 if that identity does not hold, so a run that dies partway can never read as a clean one.
#
# ⭐ THE POPULATION IS DECLARED, NOT DISCOVERED, and it is declared where it always was: the recipe lines of
# the `test-sequential` target in the Makefile, with every per-arm comment they carry.  That target is the
# old abort-on-first-red form, kept RUNNABLE on purpose -- it is the declaration this driver reads AND an
# executable twin of it, so the two cannot diverge silently, and `make test-sequential` remains the way to
# bisect a set that has gone strange.  test_gate_make_test_loops_and_reports.sh pins the agreement.
#
# ⭐ WHY NOT A SEPARATE arms.txt (the preflight shape): preflight's population genuinely cannot be derived
# (its own comment says a static grep classifies it wrongly in both directions).  This one can be, and the
# arms carry ~50 lines of measured provenance comments that thirteen seats grep by gate name in the
# Makefile.  Moving them would have broken every `grep <gate> Makefile` in the org to save a parser.
#
# USAGE
#   bash scripts/run_blocking_set.sh                  # run the declared set, loop and report
#   bash scripts/run_blocking_set.sh --list           # print the arms and their class, run nothing
#   bash scripts/run_blocking_set.sh --arms-from F    # run an arm list from a file (one per line) instead
#   bash scripts/run_blocking_set.sh --target T       # read a different declaration target
#   bash scripts/run_blocking_set.sh --shard K/N      # run ONE interleaved slice of the declared set
#   bash scripts/run_blocking_set.sh --shards N       # fan out N slices as children and MERGE their report
#   bash scripts/run_blocking_set.sh --serial-arms F  # read a different declaration of the arms that run alone
#   bash scripts/run_blocking_set.sh --shared-surfaces F  # read a different declaration of the watched surface
#
# ⭐ SHARDS, AND WHAT THEY ARE ACCEPTED ON (ceo CEO-829, from the cfo's economy measurement: 338 arms, ~35
# minutes at load 1.5-2.6, against an origin/main that took 22 landings today -- and the gaps between the last
# twelve were 0,2,2,9,4,0,3,3,322,1,3,49 minutes, so THE AVERAGE HIDES THE SHAPE: landings arrive in BURSTS of
# three or four inside five minutes and a 35-minute set cannot fit inside a burst at all).
# ⛔ THE ACCEPTANCE IS NOT A SPEEDUP. It is that a sharded run reds THE SAME RED NAME SET as a sequential one on
# the same tree (CEO-825 clause 1): an arm whose verdict changes with HOW it was run is the finding, and a faster
# set that quietly greens an arm is worth less than the slow one. Speed is reported BESIDE name-set identity,
# never instead of it; test_gate_blocking_set_shards_agree_with_sequential.sh is what asserts it.
# ⛔ THE HAZARD IS REAL AND THE CENSUS THAT FOUND IT UNDER-DETECTS, so hazardous arms are DECLARED, not sniffed:
# 280 of 336 arms build a mktemp workdir, but the port-trace gates cd into the checkout ROOT (CLAUDE.md records
# their tmp3/tmp4 litter there), timing-sensitive arms read a loaded box differently, and the one-runner board
# arms must not run twice at once. scripts/blocking_set_serial_arms.txt names the patterns that RUN ALONE in the
# parent before any fan-out. A null hazard census bounds the probe, not the thing probed.
# ⛔⭐ AND THE REFUSAL MATTERS MORE THAN THE SPEED (coo 2026-09-20, row instruments-the-blocking-set-is-367-
# serial-arms-and-it-caps-every-seat-in-the-fleet, on Lon's TENET). A fan-out that turns a COLLISION into a RED
# manufactures an UNATTRIBUTABLE FINDING: the arm does not reproduce serially, so a seat either chases a defect
# that is not there or learns to discount reds -- and ten seats on one box cannot afford either. So the fan-out
# WATCHES a declared shared surface (scripts/blocking_set_shared_surfaces.txt) around every arm, and two arms
# whose observed change sets intersect on one path while their run windows OVERLAP are BOTH rc=2 REFUSED, named
# with each other and with the path. Never red. A refusal says the one true thing -- THIS ARM WAS NOT MEASURED --
# and the cure for a repeat offender is a line in blocking_set_serial_arms.txt, never a tolerance.
# ⛔ THE DETECTOR HAS TWO FAILURE DIRECTIONS AND THE GATE PROVES BOTH: unwired, a race reads as a flaky red
# (M1); greedy, an innocent red or green is buried under a refusal and the set stops being able to report a
# defect at all (M2). test_gate_blocking_set_parallel_agrees_with_serial.sh trips on each.
# An arm line prefixed `-` is REPORTED: it is run and classified like any other, it is printed in its class,
# and it CANNOT change the exit code -- exactly what a leading `-` already meant to make.
#
# EXIT: 0 every blocking arm green / 1 at least one blocking arm RED / 2 no blocking red but at least one
# blocking REFUSAL, or the driver itself could not measure (no arms, an unexpandable make variable, a
# denominator that does not sum).

# (coo 2026-09-21, row instruments-a-blocking-set-run-is-killed-from-outside, from a COMPLETED run rather than
# a reasoned argument.) THE MEASUREMENT THAT PUT THIS HERE: a full set on this box, 6 shards, tree c8ba4567b --
# arms=381 green=110 red=11 REFUSED=260, wall 387s. SIXTY-EIGHT PERCENT OF THE LANDING GATE MEASURED NOTHING,
# and every one of the 260 refused for the SAME reason, discovered 260 times: the binary predated the tree.
# ⛔ AND THE CAUSE IS THE DOCUMENTED LANDING SEQUENCE ITSELF, WHICH IS WHY IT DESERVES A GUARD RATHER THAN A
# REMINDER. Every root's CLAUDE.md says `git pull --rebase` before every push. A REBASE REPLAYS COMMITS, AND
# REPLAYING A COMMIT REWRITES ITS FILES WITH A NEW MTIME -- identical bytes, newer timestamp. So the ordinary
# order (build, test, commit, pull --rebase, push, run the gate) leaves Makefile and src/ newer than a binary
# that is semantically perfectly current. The reflog of the run above shows it exactly: build 10:01:58, rebase
# pick 10:03:28, set started 10:03:52. Nothing was stale. Every arm refused anyway.
# ⛔ WHY THIS IS NOT MERELY WASTEFUL: rc=2 IS NOT RED, so the set runs to completion and prints "6 blocking
# arm(s) failed, 256 refused" -- and a seat at the end of a long sitting reads the 6 and lands. A gate that is
# two-thirds DARK reports in the same shape as a gate that is two-thirds green. That is CEO-582 (DARK is worse
# than RED) arriving inside the landing gate itself.
# ⭐ AND IT IS hq_raku's FINDING FROM THE OTHER DIRECTION, THE SECOND REPORT OF ONE SHAPE IN A DAY: their board
# refused with THE BINARY MOVED UNDER THIS BOARD only at the END, after the run was already paid for, and they
# said it plainly -- nothing told them at the START that they were holding a lock. A guard that fires after the
# cost is a diagnosis, not a guard. 387 seconds of a 16-core box shared by ten seats, to learn what one stat(2)
# answers before the first arm.
