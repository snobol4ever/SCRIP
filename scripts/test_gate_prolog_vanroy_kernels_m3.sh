# The van Roy kernels must RUN in mode 3, in their COUNTED form. hq_P's I26 reported them as one "m3 crash
# class"; measured, they are FOUR distinct classes (trail-arena refusal, timeout, stack overflow, and an
# unbound variable printed as the answer). Refuses rc=2 when it cannot measure -- never skip-as-success.
#
# ⛔⭐ THE KERNELS ARE GENERATED, NOT READ OUT OF GIT (hq_P 2026-09-13, CEO-567). This gate used to enumerate
#   corpus/benchmarks/prolog/vanroy/*.pl -- 21 checked-in files, each bench/<k>.pl with `main :- l__(N).`
#   frozen in, i.e. the iteration count living inside the artifact under measurement. That directory is
#   RETIRED. The same 21 kernels at the same 21 counts are now built on demand by gen_counted_set() from
#   the pristine bench/ sources plus corpus/benchmarks/prolog/fixed-iter-n.tsv, which is where those N
#   values were lifted to, verbatim by execution, so the retirement re-calibrated nothing.
#   THE NAME STAYS: "van Roy" is the kernels' PROVENANCE (van Roy's Prolog benchmark set), never the name
#   of the directory that used to hold a generated copy of them.

# ⛔⭐ THIS GATE GRADES OUTPUT, NOT EXIT STATUS (hq_P 2026-09-13, CEO-676).  It used to score a kernel
#   PASS on `rc == 0` alone.  Measured: TEN of the 21 exited 0 having printed NOTHING AT ALL -- they were
#   generated from pre-conversion sources, raised existence_error at their first goal, and never reached the
#   computation.  All ten scored as passes for months.  `nrev` and `qsort` exit 0 having printed 1438 and
#   1338 lines where N=65536 and 16384 were asked -- truncated runs scored as clean.  loop_check() compares
#   stdout against N copies of the kernel's .expected, which is the only evidence the loop ran N times.
#   A pass criterion weaker than the claim the gate is read as making is the same defect as a blank cell.
