"""util_split_master_by_kind.py -- split a master suite pair into ONE-LINERS and MULTI-LINERS.

Lon's 4th/5th consolidation statements (routed by ceo 2026-08-29, TRIO): the end state has NO
per-language folders -- per language, a ONE-LINERS file and a MULTI-LINERS file side by side in one
flat dir. Today's master is ONE file carrying both kinds; this splits the kinds into two files.

The discriminator is not invented here: ALL.csv already carries `kind`, which is exactly `line`
(818) or `block` (677) on the snobol4 master at corpus dcdf7140f. This tool reads that column
rather than re-deriving one-line-ness from the text, so the split cannot disagree with the
attribute database that the levels/rank machinery already keys on.

-- WHY THIS REFUSES RATHER THAN OVERWRITES ------------------------------------------------------
The snobol4 floor is LIVE on the master pair and GREEN (1444/0 m3, 1435/0 m4). A split that loses,
duplicates or reorders a single entry silently shrinks the correctness floor -- the
board-shrinks-instead-of-reddening shape. So this tool is verify-first and writes nothing unless
every one of these holds:

  1. PARTITION: every entry in ALL.csv lands in exactly one output, and the two outputs together
     name exactly the input's entry set. No entry lost, none duplicated, none invented.
  2. BYTE PRESERVATION: each entry's .sno text and .ref text are carried over byte-for-byte.
  3. COUNT AGREEMENT: len(one) + len(multi) == len(input), asserted separately from (1) so a
     symmetric bug cannot satisfy both.

⛔ (1) and (3) are deliberately redundant. A set-equality check and a count check fail differently:
a duplicate that replaces a lost entry passes the count and fails the set; a reordering passes both
and is caught by (2). This is the count-and-list corollary applied to a converter -- the two must
agree or the tool says why.

⛔ IT DOES NOT WIRE THE RUNNER AND IT DOES NOT DELETE THE INPUT. Retirement of the combined pair is
a separate, later decision that needs a board-equality proof first (row
`snobol4-floor-cutover-to-the-one-flat-suite-board-equality-first`). Producing the two files is
safe; adopting them is not, and the two must not ride in on one commit.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/util_split_master_by_kind.py <master_dir>            # verify only, writes nothing
    python3 scripts/util_split_master_by_kind.py <master_dir> --write    # verify, then write
Exit: 0 verified (and written, if --write) - 1 a check failed - 2 could not measure.
