# test_gate_pas_a_file_carries_its_iso_mode_and_says_so.sh -- ISO 7185 6.6.5.2 / 6.9.1, refused at run time, out loud
#
# MEASURED 2026-09-16 by hq_pascal on SCRIP 3d71bfa5b, both modes, working row pascal-pat-suite-427-to-100-percent-by-class.
# EIGHT PAT rejection tests turned on one missing piece of state. The typed-file table carried a buffer and a has-buffer
# flag but NO FILE MODE, so nothing could ask whether a file stood in Generation or Inspection, and an unopened file
# reaching put/get/read/write/eof simply returned FAILDESCR -- the program stopped at the right instruction with rc=1
# and SAID NOTHING. ⛔ THAT SILENCE IS THE DEFECT, not merely the missing check: PAT grades a rejection test on a
# non-zero exit WITH a diagnostic, so a silent abort scores exactly like an acceptance, and a user got an exit code
# with no cause. The table gains a mode (0 Undefined, 1 Generation, 2 Inspection), rewrite sets Generation, reset sets
# Inspection, and every precondition speaks through one voice that names its own ISO clause.
#
# ⭐ THE ORACLE IS NOT THE BAR HERE AND THAT IS WORTH KNOWING BEFORE YOU READ THIS GATE. Measured the same day against
# fpc 3.2.2 -Miso: of the nine mode-and-definedness witnesses, fpc DETECTS ONLY FOUR (1709 rc=105, 1710 and 1715 rc=103,
# 1757 rc=100) and exits 0 on 1712, 1713, 1714, 1716 and 1740. ISO 7185 requires all of them, and PAT is the conformance
# suite, so these arms are graded against the STANDARD and the suite's own rejection criterion, never against fpc. The
# control arm below is the opposite case and IS cut from the oracle, because a legal program has an output to compare.
#
# ⛔ 1713 IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE: reset on an undefined file. Our reset opens by name rather than requiring a prior
# definition, so curing it means changing what reset DOES, not adding a check beside it; fpc exits 0 on it too. Named,
# not hidden, and left for its own landing.
#
# ARMS: eight vendored PAT witnesses, each required to be REFUSED with a non-empty diagnostic in BOTH modes. ⛔ THE m4
# ARM LINKS AND RUNS rather than merely compiling -- every one of these is a RUNTIME condition, and a compile-only arm
# cannot see a runtime check at all (this gate's own audit sibling made exactly that mistake and reported a landed cure
# as absent). A ninth arm proves the cure DISCRIMINATES: a legal rewrite/write/reset/read round trip over a typed file
# still runs byte-identical to fpc -Miso. FAIL_ONCE=1 flips the first witness's expectation to prove the arm can fail.
