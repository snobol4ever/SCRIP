#
# ⛔ WHY THIS EXISTS (hq_B measured 2026-09-03, row stale-binary-preflight-also-covers-out-libscrip-rt-so,
# widened by ceo on the class finding): the stale-binary preflight graded ./scrip against src/ mtimes and said
# NOTHING about out/libscrip_rt.so -- the SHIPPED RUNTIME, which lags src/ exactly as the binary can. A 13:37
# .so against a 14:16 src read `exec_stmt` as STILL EXPORTED when it had already been deleted.
# ⭐ THE DANGEROUS DIRECTION IS THE FALSE GREEN: a stale OLDER .so still exports a symbol that source deleted,
# and hides one that source just added. So every `nm -D` verdict -- the rung batons' Prolog-only-globals arm
# included -- can report a clean surface for a runtime nobody is shipping. That is not a slow instrument, it is
# a confident wrong answer, and nothing printed a timestamp to contradict it.
#
# ⛔ SOURCE THIS, NEVER COPY IT (CLAUDE.md: shared authorities are sourced, never reimplemented). Seven
# nm-grading scripts and the artifacts verifier all call these; a second copy is how one of them keeps the old
# rule after the rule changes.
# RULES batch 14 -- AN INSTRUMENT QUOTES ITS REFERENCE: every refusal below prints BOTH timestamps and the file
# that set the newest one, so the reader can act without re-deriving anything.
