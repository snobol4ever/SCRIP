# test_gate_raku_the_bare_dispatcher_words_samewith_and_the_implicit_at_underscore_of_anonymous_routines_agree_with_rakudo.sh -- callsame / nextsame / nextwith / samewith WITHOUT PARENTHESES, AND `@_` / `%_` IN AN ANONYMOUS SUB OR BLOCK (and `%_` in a named sub)
# (row raku-every-suite-to-100-under-nonet-ceo-1266; first refusals of the Roast files that do not compile: nextsame 9, callsame 5 (26 files use the family), @_ 10, %_ 4).
#
# THE DEFECTS, each measured against Rakudo: the bare words callsame, nextsame (no parentheses) were read as VARIABLES ("variable 'callsame' is read but never assigned"), though callsame() and callwith(...) worked; `nextsame` did not return from the method (Rakudo: it
# calls the next candidate and never comes back), so the statements after it ran; `nextwith(args)` was undefined; `samewith(args)` (call the enclosing routine again) was undefined ("error 22: undefined function called"); `@_` was bound in a NAMED sub without a signature but not in an anonymous sub or
# a bare block (`my $f = { @_.elems }` was refused by the native emitter); `%_` (the named arguments) was bound nowhere.
# THE CURE: rk_tree.c rkb_call reads callsame / samewith / callwith / nextcallee as calls without parentheses, `nextsame` as `return callsame()` and `nextwith(args)` as `return callwith(args)`; the block builder adds the slurpy `@_` and `%_` parameters to an anonymous routine whose body reads them (the same rule
# rkb_routine already had for a named sub's `@_`, now with `%_` too); lower_raku.c rewrites `samewith(args)` inside a plain sub to a call of that sub (cx->cur_proc_name).
# NOT HERE (own rows, measured): a sub that uses `@_` AND `%_` together, or an explicit `*@a, *%h` signature, loses the positionals after the first (pre-existing: the registration inspects only the first trailing parameter); named arguments to a CLOSURE call (`$f(:a(1))` does not reach `%_`); `callsame` inside a multi sub;
# `samewith` inside a method; `&?ROUTINE`; `nextcallee`.
#
# THE WITNESS, graded in m3 (--run) and m4 (--compile + link) against a ref cut by Rakudo (/usr/bin/raku), then under SCRIP_GC_STRESS 1 3 5 in both modes.
# FAILED ONCE, measured on SCRIP d86c798d4 before the cure: every witness-mode pair red.
#
# EXIT: 0 every witness matches in both modes; 1 a mismatch or a crash on a witness; 2 REFUSED (stale binary, no gcc).
