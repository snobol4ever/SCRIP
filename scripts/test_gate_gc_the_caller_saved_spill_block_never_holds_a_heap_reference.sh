# test_gate_gc_the_caller_saved_spill_block_never_holds_a_heap_reference.sh -- THE INVARIANT BEHIND DELETING A ROOT
# REGISTRATION, MEASURED INSTEAD OF WRITTEN DOWN (cto 2026-09-20, MODE TENET; asked CTO-153, ruled by the cfo).
#
# THE FINDING.  rtcc_init.c registers the runtime's caller-saved spill block as a GC root range --
# rt_gc_root_range_add_seamsafe(&rtccb[0], &rtccb[32]) -- and gc_heap.c's ONLY walk over the root-range table opens
# `if (g_gc_rrng[i].hi) continue;`, which is exactly how that range and only that range is registered.  The other
# caller, the Prolog trail, uses the topword form with a null hi and IS visited.  g_gc_rrng_ss is incremented at
# registration and read nowhere; g_gc_segs is collected and read nowhere, so no conservative segment scan covers it
# either -- correctly, per CEO-812.  THE REGISTRATION'S ONLY EFFECT IS TO INCREMENT A COUNTER NOBODY READS: to every
# reader rtccb is a registered GC root, and to the collector it is not.
#
# ⛔ THE cfo RULED THAT VISITING IT IS NOT AN OPTION AT ALL, AND THE LAW DECIDES IT RATHER THAN TASTE.  rtccb is
# thirty-two RAW MACHINE WORDS WITH NO TYPE TAGS.  Visiting them means asking of each word "does this look like it
# points into a heap block", WHICH IS A CONSERVATIVE SCAN BY DEFINITION, and CEO-812 froze that out: everything on
# the emitted stack is a DESCR and its type field is the only tag, the heap walks typed visitors, no conservative
# scan and no pinning in any form.  A precise visit is impossible because the words carry nothing to be precise
# about.  So the registration and the seamsafe API are DELETED (the cfo's landing, gc_heap.c is their file) and
# THIS GATE IS WHAT MAKES THAT SAFE.
#
# ⛔⭐ THE MEASUREMENT THAT BUILT THIS GATE WAS WRONG, AND BUILDING THE GATE IS WHAT CAUGHT IT.  I reported to the
# cfo, the ceo and three HQs that the block was LATENT, NOT LIVE -- "47 witnesses at SCRIP_HEAP_MB=1
# SCRIP_GC_STRESS=3, ZERO slots holding a heap pointer".  THAT SWEEP RAN WITHOUT SCRIP_GC_MAPS=1, AND
# gc_walk_print RETURNS EARLY WHEN gc_maps_on() IS FALSE, so neither [GC-RTCCB] nor [GC-WALK-RTCCB] COULD HAVE
# PRINTED UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.  I grepped for a line the run was incapable of emitting and read the silence as
# a zero -- an instrument reporting success while it is not looking, which is the exact class this row exists to
# remove, produced by me while curing it in three other places the same evening.
# ⭐ THE TRUE READING, reporter enabled, same arena and stress: 806 occurrences over EIGHT SNOBOL4 witnesses --
# hb_dvec_sort_match 604, hb_nv 190, hb_datblk 4, hb_dvec_data_convert 3, hb_blob_span_defer 2, and one each in
# hb_defer_subject, hb_dtp, hb_nested_match_outer_subject.  EVERY ONE IS SLOT 5 = RTCC_SLOT_R8, the register
# rtcc.h declares as the ANCHOR.  hq_prolog's null STANDS: they ran catch_1 with SCRIP_GC_MAPS=1 at stress 3, 5,
# 10 and 25 and read zero, so Prolog genuinely does not park a heap pointer there -- despite owning 4740 of the
# 6705 stores into the block.  Two lanes, two different answers, and only the one that enabled the reporter was
# measuring.
# ⛔ WHAT IS STILL NOT ESTABLISHED, AND THE GATE SAYS SO IN ITS OWN FAILURE TEXT: none of the eight witnesses
# answers its oracle wrongly.  A pointer in an unvisited slot is NECESSARY BUT NOT SUFFICIENT for a lost value,
# the same way a store below the region base was (CTO-101), because the same block may be rooted elsewhere.  The
# sharper hazard is STALENESS rather than sweeping: an unvisited slot cannot be rewritten when a root walk
# FORWARDS a moving block, and the emitted reload after the poll restores the pre-move word.
#
# THE INVARIANT, as the cfo states it and as this grades it: rtccb is CALLER-SAVED SCRATCH and nothing that must
# survive a collection may live there -- r8 the anchor, r9 the GVA, r10 and r11 scratch, per the declared
# convention in rtx/rtcc.h.  A value that must survive a poll goes in a frame slot covered by that frame's static
# map, or is handed to the shield as a TAGGED DESCR cell in arr[], which the poll's own refusal text says in words
# (CEO-972).
