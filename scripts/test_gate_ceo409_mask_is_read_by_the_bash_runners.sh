# test_gate_ceo409_mask_is_read_by_the_bash_runners.sh -- GATE (hq_T, ceo CEO-432 item 1).
# ⛔⭐ WHAT WENT WRONG WITHOUT IT: hq_R's CEO-409 mask mechanism landed in corpus_suite_harness.py and was INERT
# for every suite graded by a BASH runner with its own loop -- a `<name>.mask` sidecar dropped beside a csnobol4
# fixture did nothing at all, silently.  That is the worst way for a safety mechanism to be absent: the author
# sees a well-formed green board and concludes the mask was honoured, so the absence CONFIRMS the belief.
# ⭐ AND THE SECOND HALF, WHICH IS WHY THIS GATE CHECKS A DIALECT: the shim exists so the harness and the bash
# runners mask by ONE set of rules.  A re-implementation in awk or sed would agree on every mask anyone happened
# to test and diverge on the first one using \d, (?i) or a lazy quantifier -- one sidecar meaning two different
# things depending on which runner read it, which is the shape nobody debugs because both readers look right.
