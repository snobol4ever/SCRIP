# util_crosscheck_two_oracle_census.sh — 4-way census over corpus/crosscheck:
#   SCRIP mode-3  vs  SPITBOL (sbl -bf)  vs  CSNOBOL4 (snobol4 -b)  vs  the checked-in .ref
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (s191 seat5, row prototype-array-dim): a .ref pinned from the WRONG oracle is
# invisible to every single-oracle harness — the program is red forever and looks like a compiler
# bug. This answers "which engine does each pin actually agree with", corpus-wide, in one sweep.
#
# ⛔ TWO INVOCATION RULES THIS SCRIPT EXISTS TO ENCODE. Both were learned by getting them WRONG and
# manufacturing a clean, plausible, entirely FALSE defect class each time (FINDING s191 §5):
#   1. RUN FROM THE CORPUS ROOT. Relative "-include 'lib/...'" resolves from there, not from the
#      program's own directory. Get this wrong and every -include program fails under BOTH oracles.
#   2. FEED EACH PROGRAM ITS OWN .input. That is what the harness's run_one does. Get this wrong and
#      every stdin-reading program disagrees with a .ref that was pinned WITH input.
# A census is a harness: copy run_one's invocation, never re-derive it.
#
# ⛔ RUN ON A PRISTINE BUILD AT A PULLED HEAD. On a stale binary this reports other seats' ALREADY
# FIXED defects as live ones (measured: 216_indirect_goto_computed, fixed by seat3 at s190).
#
# TAG = 4 chars:  [S]=SCRIP==SPITBOL  [C]=SCRIP==CSNOBOL4  [R]=SCRIP==.ref ('-' = no .ref)  [=|x]=oracles agree?
#   SCR=  green, fully corroborated          S.Rx  correct: SPITBOL is the authority and the pin agrees
#   .CRx  oracle gap — SPITBOL cannot run it (pin is fine)     ...=  ⛔ GENUINE SCRIP DEFECT (both oracles agree)
#   S..x  ⛔ THE PIN IS FROM THE WRONG ORACLE                  ..-x  no .ref at all — nothing grades it
