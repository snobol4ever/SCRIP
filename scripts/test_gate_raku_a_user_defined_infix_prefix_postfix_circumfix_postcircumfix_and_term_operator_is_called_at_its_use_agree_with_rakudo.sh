# test_gate_raku_a_user_defined_infix_prefix_postfix_circumfix_postcircumfix_and_term_operator_is_called_at_its_use_agree_with_rakudo.sh -- `sub infix:<plus>`, `sub prefix:<±>`, `sub postfix:<!>`, `sub circumfix:<⌊ ⌋>`, `sub postcircumfix:<⟨ ⟩>`, `sub term:<answer>` ARE CALLED WHERE THEY ARE USED, AS `infix:<plus>(..)`, `&infix:<plus>` AND `[plus]` TOO
# (row raku-every-suite-to-100-under-nonet-ceo-1266; found by classifying the nearly-passing sampled Roast files: integration/advent2009-day22.t `sub postfix:<!>` failed 1 of 4, advent2012-day19.t `postfix:<(k)>`, and a probe of every operator category showed the same silence in all of them).
#
# THE DEFECT, measured against Rakudo: the recognizer already registers a declared operator (RkUserOp, add_user_op) and a declaration already compiles to a routine named Rinfix_<hex of the symbol> (rk_opname.h), but THE TREE BUILDER IGNORED EVERY USE: `sub postfix:<!>($n) {..}; say 5!` printed 5, `sub infix:<plus>..; say 1 plus 2` printed 1 (x_elem's swallow loop read the operator and dropped it), `sub prefix:<±>; say ±(-3)` printed -3 (rkb_prefix_raw answered its operand), `say ⟦5⟧` was read as a variable named ⟦5⟧ ("variable is read but never assigned"), `$v⟨7⟩` answered $v, `answer` was an unassigned variable, `infix:<plus>(4, 5)` and `&infix:<plus>` were "undefined function called", and `[plus] 1, 2, 3, 4` silently computed a MAX (rk_reduce_general's fallback).
# THE CURE (one scheme, every category at once): (rk_tree.c) the builder keeps a table of the declared symbols per category (infix, prefix, postfix, circumfix, postcircumfix, term; a symbol the built-in table already owns is not entered, so `multi infix:<+>(Foo, Foo)` keeps going through the operator-overload dispatch) with the symbol's precedence; a use builds a call of the routine the declaration made, named through rk_op_canon_base
# (infix and the swallowed case in x_elem, prefix in rkb_prefix_raw, postfix and postcircumfix in rkb_postfix, circumfix and term as terms, the reduce metaoperator, the explicit call `infix:<plus>(..)` and the code reference `&infix:<plus>` through one rk_op_name_canon shared with the declaration); (rk_syntax.c) x_in answers a user sentinel at the level of the symbol's precedence (the default is additive and left associative, which Rakudo's own `2 plus 3 * 4` = 14 and `10 plus 2 plus 3` = 15 confirm), r_user_term and r_postfixish_at hand the parsed argument list to the builder.
# NOT HERE (own rows, measured): the precedence and associativity traits (`is equiv(&infix:<+>)`, `is tighter`, `is looser`, `is assoc<right>`, `is assoc<chain>`; 15 Roast files), a symbol that is also a built-in one (`multi infix:<+>(Str, Str)`, `prefix:<!>`: 20 files), the hyper form `»plus»`, `.assuming` on the reference, `[[plus]]`, a user operator declared in a role or class body, `postcircumfix` with a list assignment.
# THE WITNESS (41 lines of output cut by the INSTALLED Rakudo), graded in m3 (--run) and m4 (--compile + link), then under SCRIP_GC_STRESS 1 3 5 in both modes.
# FAILED ONCE, measured on the sitting's control build cfcfaf46d (nothing landed since touches operators): the witness program is REFUSED outright (rc 1, "variable 'answer' is read but never assigned"), so every one of its 41 output lines is missing.
#
# EXIT: 0 every witness matches in both modes; 1 a mismatch or a crash on a witness; 2 REFUSED (stale binary, no gcc).
