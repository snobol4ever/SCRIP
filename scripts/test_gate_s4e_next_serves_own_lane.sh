# test_gate_s4e_next_serves_own_lane.sh -- `next` MUST SERVE A SEAT ONLY ITS OWN HQ-LANE'S ROWS, FALLING
# THROUGH TO ANOTHER LANE ONLY WHEN ITS OWN LANE HAS NOTHING SERVABLE.
# Row next-serves-a-seat-only-rows-in-its-hqs-lane-and-no-row-carries-a-blank-owner-cell (seat14 found the
# class; ceo ruled it rank 0, 2026-09-03 20:57 CDT).
#
# THE MEASURED DEFECT: seat03 (Icon lane) held a snobol4-* row; seat05 (Prolog lane) held an icon-jcon-*
# row; seat06 (Prolog master lane) held a snobol4-gimpel-aisnobol-dotnet row; seat16 (Rebus lane) held an
# icon-strict-rung-suite row. THE ENABLING DEFECT: the picker read only the STATE column (FREE/CLAIMED/...)
# and the owner CELL when filled, never the topic's LANGUAGE, so a lane-blind rank sort served whichever
# seat asked `next` first.
#
# WHAT IT PROVES, against a THROWAWAY postoffice (S4E_POST) so the live queue is never read or written:
#   (a) OWN LANE WINS OVER RANK: a hq_B-lane seat is served its own lane's icon-* row even though a
#       snobol4-* (hq_P-lane) row sits at a LOWER rank -- proving the lane filter, not just presence.
#   (b) THE REASON IS PRINTED: the serve line names "OWN LANE" so a wandering seat (or a correctly-lane-
#       served one) is visible in its own printout, per GOAL's explicit requirement.
#   (c) CROSS-LANE FALLBACK STILL WORKS: when the seat's own lane has nothing servable at all, the
#       snobol4-* row IS served -- "your lane had nothing" is not silent starvation -- and is labelled
#       CROSS-LANE FALLBACK in the printout, not indistinguishable from an own-lane serve.
#   (d) AN EXPLICIT OWNER CELL BEATS THE LANE GUESS: a row whose owner cell already names the picking
#       identity is served even though its topic's language-derived lane would say otherwise.
#   (e) A LANE-UNDETERMINED TOPIC (no recognized language prefix, no owner cell) IS LANE-NEUTRAL: served
#       in the OWN-LANE pass itself, not deferred to fallback -- this is this row's own kind of topic.
#   (f) ceo IS NEVER LANE-RESTRICTED (GOAL's explicit carve-out, same identity-shape reasoning as the
#       MODE guard -- not s4e_is_hq(), which counts ceo as an HQ).
#   (g) AN HQ IDENTITY IS ALSO LANE-RESTRICTED, not just fleet seats (GOAL: "an HQ is restricted to its
#       own lane's rows").
#   (h) A SEAT'S LANE READS FROM ITS OWN POSTOFFICE HQ FILE, and a missing/stale one degrades to
#       LANE-BLIND (today's behaviour) rather than starving the seat entirely.
