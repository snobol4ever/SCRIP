# test_gate_wreg_claim.sh — WREG r10/r11 CLAIM SCOPE GATE (GOAL-PASSTHRU-RBP-ERAD, LADDER WREG, rung WREG-0).
#
# WHY THIS GATE EXISTS.  LADDER WREG reserves rΓ=r10 and rΩ=r11 as PRODUCT-WIDE dynamic wire registers: every
# glue kind carries γ in r10 and ω in r11, so a blob needs ZERO receiving code.  A reservation of that shape is
# a GLOBAL fact about all emitted code, but templates are edited by many concurrent seats and NOTHING in the
# build objects when a template grabs r10 or r11 as ordinary scratch.  That is precisely the class that cost
# s6/s7 on r9 (see test_gate_rtcc_claimed_regs.sh's header).  This gate makes the WREG version MECHANICAL, and
# it exists BEFORE the claim goes live so the sweep has a burn-down number instead of an opinion.
#
# RELATIONSHIP TO test_gate_rtcc_claimed_regs.sh — TWO DIFFERENT INVARIANTS, BOTH WANTED:
#   RTCC gate  = COLLISION class.  "Who writes a live-claimed register while also reading through GVARQ?"
#   THIS gate  = SCOPE class.      "Who MENTIONS r10/r11 at all, outside the sites licensed to own the wires?"
# A file can pass the RTCC gate and still fail this one: using r10 as scratch is harmless to GVA and fatal to γ.
#
# ⛔ SUB-REGISTER SPELLINGS ARE PART OF THE CLAIM (WREG-0 finding, 2026-08-10).  LADDER WREG's design measured
# the sweep at 178 sites by counting the quoted full-register spellings "r10" (105) and "r11" (73).  That count
# reproduces EXACTLY at bce9a4b0 — but it is NOT the whole surface.  r10d/r11d/r10b/r11b name the SAME PHYSICAL
# REGISTERS and are invisible to a "r10"-shaped grep.  That blind spot is not theoretical: it is how the ONE
# pre-existing r10 claim in the product hid from the design's census —
#     src/templates/bb/bb_define.cpp:25-26
#       #define AB_TC_REG   ((g_rtcc_on && RTCC_GLOBAL_R9_GVA) ? "r10"  : "r9")
#       #define AB_TC_REG_D ((g_rtcc_on && RTCC_GLOBAL_R9_GVA) ? "r10d" : "r9d")
# — the AB return type-code register, moved r9 -> r10 by the s8 RTCC-safety fix precisely BECAUSE r10 was, in
# that fix's own words, "scratch-tier claimed with NO global assigned".  WREG assigns a global to r10 and thereby
# retires the property that fix depends on.  This gate therefore matches EVERY spelling, and it matches through
# the macro (a name-indirected register is still a use).
#
# WHAT IS CHECKED (textual, deliberately — a dataflow proof is out of scope for a grep gate):  every mention of
# r10/r11 in any spelling, in CODE (comments stripped), under src/templates/ and src/emitter/, minus the
# registry.  The registry encodes the four site classes LADDER WREG licenses to own the wires:
#   glue emitters · blob-exit emitters · x86_asm.h encoder internals · suspension-capture site.
#
# STATUS TIERS (mirrors the RTCC gate's live/pending discipline — do not skip the middle one):
#   PENDING  (today)      — the claim is DESIGNED and the sweep is UNDONE.  Default run is INFORMATIONAL: it
#                           prints the burn-down and exits 0, so it blocks nobody before WREG-1/2 land.
#   LIVE     (at WREG-2)  — the moment site glue actually carries γ/ω in r10/r11, flip WREG_CLAIM_LIVE=1 below
#                           AND add "r10:GAMMA:WREG-2" + "r11:OMEGA:WREG-2" to LIVE_CLAIMS in
#                           test_gate_rtcc_claimed_regs.sh.  That second edit is what buys WREG the H2 veneer
#                           writeback protection; skipping it re-runs the s6/s7 r9 story on r10.
#
# Usage: bash scripts/test_gate_wreg_claim.sh [--strict]
#   default  : INFORMATIONAL — print the sweep burn-down, exit 0.
#   --strict : HARD GATE — exit 1 if any non-registered site remains.  WREG-0's exit criterion.

# ⛔ WHY PINNING EXISTS (W-0, 2026-08-12).  The registry licenses a file by BASENAME, so a bare entry for a
# large file licenses every future r10/r11 use in it too — which turns the registry into the silencer its own
# header forbids.  `emit.cpp` is the live case: 6 occurrences, ALL of them wire-owning today, inside a file no
# one would claim is finished.  Pinning records the count that was actually reviewed; the gate then reports
# DRIFT the moment the file grows a use nobody cleared, so the license covers what was inspected and nothing
# more.  An entry with no `occ=N` keeps the old blanket behaviour and is reported as UNPINNED.

# ⛔ NEVER `| grep -q` UNDER pipefail (s11 conviction, recorded in test_gate_rtcc_claimed_regs.sh): grep -q exits
# on first match and closes the pipe, the upstream sed|perl takes SIGPIPE(141), pipefail propagates it, and A
# MATCH READS AS A MISS.  grep -c reads to EOF and cannot SIGPIPE the upstream.  Every count below uses grep -c.
#
# ⛔ BUT `grep -c` COUNTS LINES, NOT MENTIONS (s14 correction).  s13 published these totals labelled "mentions";
# they are LINE counts, and a line carrying both registers (`lea r10,..` + `lea r11,..`, 10 such in bb_call_fn)
# counts once.  Measured gap on the template/emitter surface: 258 lines vs 314 true occurrences, +22%.  The
# SWEEP is per-occurrence work, so sizing it from the line count understates it.  Both numbers are now printed:
# LINES stays primary and comparable with every number s13 recorded, OCC is the honest edit surface.  `grep -o |
# wc -l` is SIGPIPE-safe by the same argument as grep -c -- wc reads to EOF and never closes the pipe early.
