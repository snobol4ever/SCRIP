# util_parser_grid.sh [lang ...] -- THE PARSER GRID: THE STAND-ALONE C PARSER, SCRIP AND SPITBOL ON THE PARSE CLOCK, ONE FILE LIST
# FOR ALL THREE (Lon 2026-09-29, in-chat to the ceo, verbatim: "The goal is parser.sc same as C and 2x faster than SPITBOL." and "We
# want focus on accuracy and speed of parser.sc as prep for replacing all SCRIP parsers."; MODE QUARTET, CEO-1364; the coo's row
# parser-sc-speed-grid-c-scrip-spitbol-on-the-parse-clock-lon-2026-09-29-ceo-1364, committed from the ceo's scratch pcmp.sh, which
# is .github/wip-patches/pcmp-parsers-vs-clean-sbl-2026-09-29.sh). A MEASUREMENT: it writes no row, no score cell, no progress append.
#
# THE BAR (the row's): SCRIP's parse clock equal to C's (C/SCRIP >= 1.00) and SPITBOL/SCRIP >= 2.00 on every parser.
#
# LANGUAGES: the arguments, else every bootstrap/parser_<lang>.sc whose driver reads PARSER_FILES (six today; Raku joins by itself
# when the rewritten parser_raku.sc prints trees through that driver). A language named whose driver does not read the list REFUSES.
# THE FILE LIST, ONE FOR ALL THREE ENGINES, DERIVED HERE AND PRINTED WITH ITS COUNT: every corpus program of the language (the tree
# gate's corpus population: *.<ext> outside .git and corpus/library, not ALL.*), less each file that ENDS an engine's run before
# its PARSER-METRICS line. Each engine scans the WHOLE population on its own, so its count is independent of the others' (a file
# that kills two engines is counted under both) and the list is the population less the union. Measured on 2026-09-29: the C Icon parser exits the process on a link it cannot open, and SPITBOL stops on
# a run-time error in the parser program (field function argument is wrong datatype) -- either way every later file goes unparsed.
# Each engine runs the list; when a run dies, the files from the last "== <file>" it printed are run ALONE until one dies alone,
# that file leaves the list and the scan resumes after it (a buffered engine can die past the last header it flushed; a file that
# dies only in company leaves as the last one begun). The count each engine dropped is printed beside the list; GRID_OUT keeps names.
# A list run is bounded by GRID_TIMEOUT (600 s) and a file run alone by GRID_ONE_TIMEOUT (60 s); a file that outlasts either leaves.
# THE THREE ENGINES, each reading PARSER_FILES=<list> and printing "== <file>" then the file's tree, and one line
# PARSER-METRICS files= bytes= parse_first_us= parse_us= whose parse_us is the clock:
#   C      out/parser_<lang> (src/tools/parser_main.c): times only its parser -- no lowering, no I/O; a link or include is resolved
#          outside the clock (IPATH names the corpus's IPL procs, since the parser looks beside its own binary, which is out/).
#   SCRIP  the bootstrap chain + bootstrap/parser_<lang>.sc compiled ONCE to a mode-4 binary; the driver times only Init*() +
#          Src ? Compiland + Pop() -- reading a file and printing its tree are outside the clock.
#   SBL    sbl_clean_bin -bf (the clean benchmark oracle, never the monitor-hooked x64 fork: GOAL-SNOCONE-100 cursor 29k) running
#          scrip --transpile of the same chain; the same driver, the same clock. TIME() reads nanoseconds in both, measured.
#   SCRIP and SBL both run -s2000m -d8000m -i64m; SCRIP_DIAG=0 for the compile and every run. The median of GRID_RUNS (3) runs.
#   VIA TRANSPILE: a language named in GRID_VIA_TRANSPILE (default: raku) has its SCRIP binary compiled from the same transpiled
#   chain SPITBOL runs, through the SNOBOL4 frontend, and its row says "via transpile" -- the ceo's order of 2026-09-29 19:4x
#   (da1b3a85a's rewritten parser_raku.sc hangs on a second statement when the chain is compiled directly as .sc, a Snocone-frontend
#   defect; the default drops raku the day the ceo telegrams the cure). Raku's C clock is rk_parse_tree: parse and tree, as the .sc's.
# COLUMNS: files, bytes, C ms, SCRIP ms, SBL ms, SBL/SCRIP, C/SCRIP, trees -- every run is made under PARSER_TREE_HASH=1, so each
# engine prints ONE NUMBER per file in place of its tree (125bb54e6, the cfo's: the dump's bytes folded in memory, h = (h * 256 +
# byte) mod (2^55 - 55), outside every parse clock), and each file's number from SCRIP is compared with the same file's from
# SPITBOL: SCRIP==SBL when every file agrees, else DIFFER n/N, how many and never how (Lon 2026-09-29: "It shows only how many do
# not match, not in what ay do they not match."; the details come from the full dump of a mismatching file). THE CANARY: the first
# file that printed a number is dumped in full by SCRIP and by SPITBOL, and each number must be an independent fold of its own
# dump, so a hash that stopped folding REFUSES rc=2 instead of reading SCRIP==SBL (the tree gate's canary, the same fold).
# THE HASH-OFF CONTROL (the ceo's ruling of 2026-09-29 20:4x CDT, on its measurement at 20:38: PARSER_TREE_HASH=1 read SCRIP's
# Snocone parse_us 58 -> 83 ms on the 2536a296c runtime although the fold runs outside the clock; 59 -> 60 at 8c610af38; C and
# SPITBOL not inflated): after the timed runs SCRIP runs the list once more with PARSER_TREE_HASH=0, printing its trees in full, and
# that clock is printed beside the hash-on median; a hash-on clock more than ten percent off it either way is named on the
# language's row as HASH GAP. The trees still compare by hash, and the hash-on median stays the grid's SCRIP column.
# THE RUNTIME MEASURED IS A CHECKOUT'S OWN: GRID_ROOT=<a SCRIP checkout> (default: this one) names the scrip, out/libscrip_rt.so,
# out/parser_<lang> and bootstrap/ measured, each refused when older than that checkout's src/. RT_OPT IS READ BACK, NEVER ASSUMED:
# the linked runtime's tag (Makefile: RT_TAG, an md5 of RT_OPT|ZCFLAGS) against the tag of the checkout's default RT_OPT and, when
# it differs, against the tag of the RT_OPT this run was handed in its environment; neither agreeing REFUSES rc=2, because a number
# without its RT_OPT is unlabelled (RULES.md INSTRUMENT LAWS). THE SPEED RUNTIME (-O2 -DRT_DIAG=0, Lon 2026-09-29) IS BUILT BY HAND
# IN A SCRATCH WORKTREE and read here beside the -O0 default: GRID_ROOT=<worktree> RT_OPT='<its RT_OPT>' util_parser_grid.sh.
# No -O2 arm lives in this file (RULES.md NO -O2 BUILDS, CEO-1246: the -O2 build is a by-hand instrument; the grid only reads it).
# rc 0 = every language measured; rc 2 = something could not be measured (named on its line). Never two heavy runs in flight
# (CEO-1342): the whole grid is one heavy run and prints the load at its start and end.
