# test_gate_s4e_donewhen_runs_the_whole_criterion.sh -- `done` RUNS THE WHOLE DONE-WHEN, NOT ITS FIRST PHYSICAL LINE.

# Row s4e-msg-donewhen-truncation-false-closes-multiline-heredoc-batons (seat04 reproduced it end to end; ceo ranked
# the cure 0 in hq_T's lane 2026-09-05 14:38).
#
# ⛔⭐⭐ THE DEFECT, AND ITS DIRECTION IS WHAT MAKES IT LETHAL. The ONE extraction point was
# `sed -n 's/^DONE-WHEN:...//p' "$b" | head -1` -- one physical line. For the self-contained heredoc witness this
# project encourages, the captured text is `cat > /tmp/w.sno <<'EOF'` with no closing delimiter: bash WARNS, treats
# the body as EMPTY, writes a zero-byte file, and that cat -- the only command reached -- exits 0. The criterion
# exits 0 HAVING RUN NOTHING, so a broken tree and a fixed one are byte-identical in verdict. ⭐ MEASURED CLOSURE:
# snobol4-pattern-primitive-as-function-argument-always-fails-in-callee closed DONE 2026-09-05T15:33Z through
# exactly this path while its full text exits 1 on the same tree. 185 of 1128 live batons carry a multi-line
# DONE-WHEN, so this is a population, not an anecdote.
#
# FOUR ARMS against a THROWAWAY postoffice under mktemp -- never the live one:
#   (A) TWO-LINE CRITERION, SECOND LINE RED: line 1 passes, line 2 exits 1 -> rc=1 NOT DONE, row NOT closed.
#       This is the ceo's named fail-once shape and the minimal statement of the whole defect.
#   (B) HEREDOC WITNESS: writes a file, then greps it, then exits 1 -> rc=1, AND the file is non-empty, which is
#       what proves the BODY ran rather than the opener alone. ⛔ Arm A alone cannot prove that: a fix that read
#       two lines and stopped would pass A and still truncate every heredoc.
#   (C) UNTERMINATED HEREDOC (an author's mistake, or a future re-truncation) -> REFUSED rc=2, row NOT closed.
#       Never rc=0 and never rc=1: bash cannot finish reading it, so nobody measured anything.
#   (D) MULTI-LINE AND GENUINELY GREEN -> rc=0 and the row CLOSES. Without this the gate would pass on a `done`
#       that had simply stopped closing anything, which is the cheap way to satisfy A/B/C and cure nothing.
#   (E) ⛔ THE ARM THAT COST THE MOST TO LEARN: a COMPLETE one-line criterion followed by indented PROSE ANNOTATION
#       -- "⛔ DONE-WHEN REWRITTEN 2026-08-24 (seat04): the line above used to be prose..." -- must still close
#       green. 121 of the 122 DONE batons whose field spans lines are exactly that shape, so the obvious
#       continuation rule ("read to the next column-0 label", which is how GOAL: carries paragraphs) would have
#       fed their annotation to `bash -c` and broken 121 correctly-closing rows to fix one. The cure is that
#       continuation happens ONLY while bash says the text is UNFINISHED.
#   (F) A SECOND column-0 `DONE-WHEN:` whose text is a REAL COMMAND -> REFUSED rc=2, row NOT closed. Only the
#       first line has ever run, so such a baton closes on HALF its own contract while the other half sits in the
#       file where every reader counts it as part of the bar. ⭐ MEASURED on the ceo's seed: 39 live batons carry
#       more than one, 10 extras are real commands, 6 of those rows are DONE, and one of those six -- snobol4-
#       xfail-class-setexit-errlimit-composition-2-entries -- has a RED second half ("cross-ref=0 (want 2)").
#   (G) THE SAME SHAPE WITH A LEFTOVER MINT PLACEHOLDER beneath a real criterion -> still closes green. Untidy is
#       not ambiguous, and 4 of the 39 are exactly that; refusing them would block real rows for a cosmetic reason.
#   (H) A SECOND column-0 `DONE-WHEN:` BYTE-IDENTICAL TO THE FIRST -> still closes green. Arm F refuses because
#       "which line is the contract" is a question about intent; identical text asks no such question, the
#       extractor taking the first loses nothing, and no half of any bar went unrun. ⭐ MEASURED: 3 of the 10
#       extras that survive F's placeholder filters are exactly this, and all three were being refused for a
#       cosmetic reason -- the same mistake G exists to prevent, one shape over.
# EXIT 0 all arms hold on the live script AND each mutant goes red; 1 otherwise; 2 REFUSED (fixture cannot be built).
