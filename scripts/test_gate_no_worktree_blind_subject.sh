# test_gate_no_worktree_blind_subject.sh -- CENSUSES THE WORKTREE-BLIND SUBJECT IDIOM, and REFUSES rc=2 when the
# tree it is standing in is not the tree that idiom would have graded.
#
# ⛔⭐ THE MEASURED CASE (the coo, 2026-09-13, reported against its OWN landing -- row
# snobol4-a-gate-that-reads-the-main-tree-src-passes-in-a-worktree-while-origin-is-red).  A pre-landing
# preflight run in a second worktree read 33 arms 0 red WHILE ORIGIN WAS RED for about thirty-five minutes
# after f0d0adf5b landed a weak pas_gc_roots.  Nothing was skipped and nothing lied: every arm ran, and every
# arm graded the MAIN checkout instead of the worktree being pushed.
#
# ⛔ THE IDIOM, WHICH IS WHAT THIS GATE COUNTS.  Two hops, of which the first is correct:
#       S4E="${S4E_HOME:-$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/../.." && pwd)}"    # UP  -- right, siblings live there
#       SRC="$S4E/SCRIP/src" ; SCRIP="$S4E/SCRIP/scrip" ; OUT="$S4E/SCRIP/out"    # DOWN -- WRONG, hardcoded name
# `SCRIP` is the name of the MAIN checkout and of nothing else, so the round trip lands in the tree you are not
# standing in.  ⭐ NOTE WHAT THE SECOND HOP REACHES BESIDES src: `$S4E/SCRIP/scrip` is the main tree's BINARY.
# A gate written that way grades a binary the seat never built, which is the same defect with a longer fuse --
# you can `make` in your worktree all day and the gate will keep grading the other build.
#
# ⭐ WHY THE CENSUS IS THE DELIVERABLE AND NOT A ONE-LINE FIX.  The idiom is not a typo anyone committed once;
# it is the house pattern, pasted forward.  A cure applied to the one gate that was caught leaves the class
# intact and leaves the next seat with the same thirty-five minutes.  So this gate names every instance, and it
# names them by reading the scripts on disk rather than from a list anyone maintains by hand -- a hard-coded
# population never announces what it left out.
#
# ⛔ IT IS REPORTED-NOT-BLOCKING TODAY, ON PURPOSE AND WITH A RAMP.  The population is large and curing it is a
# per-script judgement (some of these legitimately want a sibling, and telling the two apart needs a reader).
# A gate that blocked on the whole class today would stop the very landings that shrink it.  What IS blocking:
# the RATCHET -- the count may never grow -- and the DIVERGENCE REFUSAL below, which is the part that actually
# protects a verdict.  Set WORKTREE_BLIND_BLOCKING=1 to prove it can say no.
#
# THE THREE EXIT CODES (lib_gate.sh's rule): 0 clean · 1 violation · 2 could-not-measure.  Never skip-as-success.

# nobody checked, and the cure is only believable if you can WATCH it fail the old way and pass the new way.
# A pasted terminal session proves that once, on a tree that has since moved; TRANSCRIPTION IS WHERE PROVENANCE
# DIES. This arm mints a real sibling worktree, arms its src with a weak stub the main checkout does NOT have,
# and asserts BOTH halves: the OLD idiom reports the armed tree clean, and the CURED gate fails on it.
# ⛔ It asserts the OLD behaviour too, on purpose. A fail-once proof that only exercises the fix cannot tell a

# flag that preflight read 39 of 40 on a clean origin/main with nobody's diff behind the red). A `grep -rl`
# matches the string ANYWHERE in a file, so the two files that exist to CURE this idiom -- lib_subject_tree.sh
# and this gate -- were counted as instances of it, because both QUOTE the bad two hops in their own teaching
# comments. ⭐ THAT IS NOT A COSMETIC MISCOUNT, IT IS AN UNREACHABLE FLOOR: the refusal a dozen lines below
# says a finished campaign "would have been landed with the ceiling lowered to 0 in the same commit", and with
