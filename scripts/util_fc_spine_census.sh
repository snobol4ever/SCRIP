# util_fc_spine_census.sh — RUNG ZB-FC (ARCH-ZETA §13): count FORTH-cell pushes per kind across the corpus
# under SCRIP_ZETA_PORT=6.  A LEDGER COUNTER, NOT A GATE (the .s-regen philosophy: never enforce sameness —
# the number is supposed to GROW as ZB-FC-3/ZB-ACT-3 land).  Method: compile every crosscheck .sno with
# --compile under PORT=6, attribute each "sub rsp, 16" to the IR_MATCH_* comment block it appears under.
# ⛔⛔ THIS METHOD CANNOT CURRENTLY MEASURE ANYTHING, REGARDLESS OF POPULATION (found seat14 2026-09-04,
# row dead-suite-path-consumer-sweep, FINDING-2026-09-04-seat14-fc-spine-census-comment-scan-is-permanently-
# blind-since-fix-8a.md): `x86("comment", ...)` (src/templates/x86/x86_asm.h:1567) is `return std::string()`
# UNCONDITIONALLY — GOAL-BB-FIXUP.md's FIX-8a terse-comment rung made this a deliberate, ratified, gated
# no-op for BOTH media (RULES.md "x86(\"comment\") is medium-complete" — complete because it does nothing
# in either medium, not because it prints the comment correctly in both). So "# IR_MATCH_*" never appears
# in `--compile` output at all, for any input — 0 FC CELLS is not evidence ZB-FC-3/ZB-ACT-3 haven't landed;
# it is evidence this instrument's premise (grep the .s for a comment) died when FIX-8a landed, upstream of
# and unrelated to the corpus-path fossil this row cured. A real census needs a different signal — e.g.
# instrumenting zls_fc_cell() (src/ir/zeta_storage.c) directly, or a --dump-ir pass — not .s comment-text.
