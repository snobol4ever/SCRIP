# CN-13 CONST-GRAPH GATE -- the MARGINAL EMITTED-ASM COST OF ONE MORE USE SITE of a declared constant pattern.
#
# ⛔ WHY THIS GATE EXISTS BEFORE THE CODE DOES.  CN-13's whole claim is a COUNT IN THE EMITTED ASM ("one graph +
# N thin sites instead of N copies"), and this project has twice paid for a rung whose success metric was an asm
# count graded by behaviour gates only: s146/s147's "KW-2/KW-3" were quietly redefined to index-plus-call and
# marked DONE while 0/5 keywords were actually direct, and five sessions of behaviour-green scaffolding went by
# before s165 counted the instructions and found it.  The transferable lesson (s165, GOAL-SNOBOL4-100): a
# directive whose success metric is a count in the emitted asm needs a gate that COUNTS THE EMITTED ASM.
#
# WHAT IT MEASURES.  A declared constant pattern used at N sites, mode-4 .s line count, N=1 vs N=25.  Scaling is
# exactly linear (measured s166: 136 lines/site across N=1,2,12,24), so (lines25-lines1)/24 IS the cost of one
# whole extra COPY of the graph -- the duplication CN-13 deletes.  It is a RATCHET: it fails if the marginal cost
# grows past the watermark, so the number can only go down.  When CN-13 lands, drop CG_WATERMARK to the new
# measurement; the CN-13 TARGET line below is the number that says the rung actually happened.
#
# Behaviour is graded too, in BOTH modes and BOTH killswitch arms -- an asm count alone can be made green by a
# compiler that emits less and answers wrong.
