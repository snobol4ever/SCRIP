# test_gate_icn_bal_is_a_backtracking_generator.sh -- hq_I 2026-09-06.
#
# THE CLASS: icon-bal-generator-yields-one-result-not-a-backtracking-sequence (rank 1, root-caused by
# seat07 from ipl/progs/lisp.icn, whose tokenizer -- bstol/balstr/checkbal -- is built entirely on
# backtracking through bal's successive balance points).
#
# ⛔ IT WAS TWO INDEPENDENT DEFECTS AND EACH HID THE OTHER, which is why this gate grades the whole
# SEQUENCE by value and never merely asks whether a second result exists:
#   1. lower_icon.c admitted `bal` to the generator-builtin test only at nargs==1, so the ZERO-argument
#      form -- how every IPL scanner writes it, `s ? tab(bal())` -- built a plain IR_CALL: one result,
#      no beta port, no resumption at all.
#   2. the box's beta arm re-entered the scan loop PAST the character it had just succeeded on, without
#      running that character through the '('/')' depth accounting, because the success path exits
#      through gamma before reaching the classifier. The opening bracket was never counted, depth stayed
#      0, and every following position looked balanced.
# Fixing 1 alone yields 1,2,3,4 on "(AB) " where iconx yields 1,5 -- WRONG, and it looks like progress.
# ⭐ THE GENERAL FORM: the success arm and the classify arm are two exits from ONE loop iteration, and a
# generator's resume must re-enter the iteration it LEFT, never the next one.
#
# EVERY EXPECTATION HERE IS CUT FROM THE REAL ORACLE AT RUN TIME, not typed: the gate runs icont/iconx on
# the same source and diffs. A hand-typed expectation is a second opinion about Icon, and this class is
# precisely one where a plausible wrong answer (1,2,3,4) reads as correct to anyone not holding iconx.
