util_migrate_snocone_to_lang_space.py — LS-5.a corpus migration.

Rewrites Snocone .sc source files to the post-LS-4 language:

  &&     → space (juxtaposition concat).  SPITBOL Manual Ch.15
           lifts space-as-concat at priority 4; Andrew Koenig's
           .sc had && doing the same job.  After LS-4 the new
           Bison parser accepts the space form and rejects &&.

  ||     → (a, b)  (SPITBOL alt-eval, Manual Ch.15 footnote).
           Wrapping parens are mandatory because SPITBOL alt-eval
           is "comma-separated list inside parens" — a top-level
           comma without parens is a syntax error.  N-ary chains
           collapse: `a || b || c` → `(a, b, c)`.

  go to NAME ;   → goto NAME ;       (single-keyword form)

  bare %  modulo → REMDR(a, b)       (no occurrences in the corpus
           today — verified by grep before this script ran — but
           the rule is included for completeness so a future .sc
           file that picks up % modulo gets migrated correctly.)

What this script does NOT touch:
  - string literals — '...' and "..."
  - line comments — // to end of line
  - block comments — /* ... */
  - single | (pattern alternation) — only doubled || gets the
    alt-eval rewrite

Edge-case behaviour explicitly verified against the LS-4 grammar
in src/frontend/snocone/snocone_parse.y:
  - `if (a || b)`  → `if ((a, b))` — the `if`'s own parens
    syntactically wrap a single expr0; the alt-eval needs its
    OWN parens for the `T_LPAREN expr0 T_COMMA exprlist_ne
    T_RPAREN` production to fire.
  - `(a || b)`     → `((a, b))` — same shape, two paren pairs:
    inner is alt-eval, outer is grouping (or wherever the bare
    paren came from).
  - `x = a || b`   → `x = (a, b)` — the RHS is a single alt-eval
    value, no extra wrapping needed.

# || rewrite — the only non-trivial transform
#
# Andrew's `||` was a binary op at SPITBOL pri 4.  Replacement is
# alt-eval `(e1, e2, ...)` — comma-separated list inside parens.
#
# Approach: walk a code-only span left to right, tracking paren
# depth, accumulating spans of "ALT-EVAL operands" separated by
# `||`.  When we hit a non-`||` boundary (close-paren that
# matches our scope, semicolon, top-level newline boundary, or
# end-of-span), if we collected any `||` operators we emit
# `(op1, op2, op3)` for that range.
#
# Subtle but important: alt-eval operands inherit the surrounding
# precedence.  In SPITBOL, `||` was pri 4 (same as concat, right-
# assoc).  Anything LOWER than pri 4 (`=` pri 0, `?` pri 1, `|`
# pri 3) binds wider, so `a = b || c` means `a = (b || c)` not
# `(a = b) || c`.  Our migration must respect this: the LHS of
# the rewritten alt-eval is just `b`, not `a = b`.
#
# Tactically, we identify alt-eval-operand boundaries by walking
# over the SPITBOL pri 0..3 operator tokens at the SAME paren
# depth as the `||` we found, and stopping at the first one of
# them.  Operators we treat as "lower priority, ends an operand
# on the LEFT side of a ||":
#   = (assignment, pri 0) — but only when not inside a function
#                           call's arg list (then `,` is the
#                           separator, not assignment)
#   ?  (match, pri 1)
#   |  (alternation, pri 3) — single | not ||
#
# In practice, every `||` use in the corpus we surveyed (3 hits
# total: tree.sc x2, sc8_strings.sc x1) sits inside an `if (...)`
# condition where the surrounding context is already paren-bounded.
# The general algorithm is robust; the small-corpus check is a
# safety net.
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


# Tokens that close an alt-eval operand on the LEFT (operators of
# priority strictly less than 4).  At the same paren depth as the
# || we're processing, anything matching one of these ends an
# operand and the `||` doesn't extend back past it.
#
# We parse these as discrete tokens, NOT as regex character
# classes, because of context: `==` is two `=` chars but is NOT
# the assign operator; `||` is two `|` chars but is the operator
# we're rewriting.  Our state-machine tokenizer below handles
# this directly.

# Simple SPITBOL/Snocone tokenizer for in-source use.  Returns
# token (kind, start, end) tuples for tokens we care about.
# The tokenizer SKIPS string-literal and comment regions
# transparently — those bytes still occupy character positions
# in the source, but no token boundary or rewrite touches them.
# Other bytes are passed through unchanged.

          - the innermost open paren/brace/bracket whose match

      3. Within that scope, find all the `||` operators at the
         scope's depth (NOT inside nested parens).  Group them.
      4. For each group, find operand boundaries:
          - left-end: the previous SEMI / ASSIGN / MATCH / PIPE
            at scope depth, or the scope opener
          - right-end: the next SEMI / scope closer

            looser, so they also terminate the alt-eval operand

    We do replacements right-to-left so earlier offsets remain
