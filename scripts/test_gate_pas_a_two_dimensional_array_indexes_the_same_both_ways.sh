#
# MEASURED 2026-09-13 by the coo on origin 02c9087c4, taking the P5 self-host row. ISO 7185 6.5.3.2 defines x[i,j] as an
# ABBREVIATION for x[i][j] -- the two spellings are the same access and a processor must accept both. SCRIP accepted only
# the comma form: a two-dimensional array written x[i][j] produced NO OUTPUT AT ALL, silently, in both modes, because the
# selector flattened two subscripts to the array's column count only when they arrived in one bracket pair.
#
# Pascal-P5's compiler pcom.pas declares cdxs as "array [1..6, 1..7] of integer" and writes cdxs[1][1], so this silently
# lost its instruction cost tables and terminated inside initdx before compiling a line. It is the third defect between
# SCRIP and the P5 milestone, after the record-variable scope and the field-table width.
#
# Cure, one rule in pascal.y: a single subscript applied to an already-subscripted VAR whose declared column count is
# known flattens exactly as the comma form does. pascal.y keeps its 5 shift/reduce conflicts.
#
# ⛔ WHAT THIS GATE DOES NOT CLAIM: an array declared as an ARRAY OF AN ARRAY TYPE (array [1..6] of row) indexed r[i][j]
# is a different representation, is still not accepted, and is not cured here. This gate covers the ISO abbreviation of a
# two-dimensional array only, which is what the standard's 6.5.3.2 equivalence is about.
#
# ARMS: one program, both modes, byte-identical to fpc -Miso -- a 6x7 array zeroed through a nested loop in the separate
# subscript form, four elements written and read back, and the whole array summed. FAIL_ONCE=1 corrupts the sum.
