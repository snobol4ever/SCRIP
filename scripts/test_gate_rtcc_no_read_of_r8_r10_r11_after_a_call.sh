# test_gate_rtcc_no_read_of_r8_r10_r11_after_a_call.sh -- EMITTED CODE NEVER READS r8, r10 OR r11 AFTER A CALL OR A POLL
# BEFORE IT WRITES IT, SO NOTHING SPILLS THEM INTO rtccb AND NOTHING RELOADS THEM (cto ruling-retire-the-r8-r10-r11-writeback-
# yes-with-a-standing-reader-gate, 2026-10-09, condition (1); hq_runtime).
#
# THE RETIREMENT IT HOLDS: the rtcc bracket around a C call and the poll wrote r8, r10 and r11 into rtccb+40, +56, +64 and
# reloaded them after; nothing in C reads those slots, and a masked asm leaf leaving a heap word in r8 or r10 had that word
# spilled into the block at the next poll (hq_collector, 3925 detections). The bracket now carries r9 alone (the GVA base) and
# r11 only under SCRIP_DIAG_REGS; the driver's entry trampolines load r9 alone. That is sound only while no emitted path reads
# one of the three after a call before a write, and this gate is that proof, so a template that starts reading r10 after a
# call reds here by name instead of breaking silently.
#
# ARMS: (a) the reader's selftest (eleven planted streams, the reload-skip fail-once among them); (b) MODE 4: every gc witness
# compiled to .s and graded at every call and every global entry, want reads=0; (c) MODE 3: the sealed slabs of six witnesses
# across the languages, dumped by gdb at bb_seal, cut at the slab's ZMAP frame-map block (the data the emitter appends after
# the last instruction, which a linear disassembly would read as code), disassembled by objdump, want reads=0; (d) THE PLANT,
# both media: a read of r8 inserted after the first call of a real witness stream reads red and names r8; (e) THE BRACKET IS
# GONE: no witness .s stores or reloads r8, r10 or r11 through rtccb; (f) THE DIAG ROAD (the cto's review, condition 2):
# five witnesses under SCRIP_DIAG_REGS=1 print exactly what they print without it, in both modes under stress 1, and
# carry r11 (its rtccb+64 reload) and not r8 or r10; a plant that drops r11 from the mask is seen.
# LIMIT, NAMED: a later call that takes r8 as its fifth argument without writing it is a read no stream reader can see.
