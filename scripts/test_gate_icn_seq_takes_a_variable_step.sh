# test_gate_icn_seq_takes_a_variable_step.sh -- seq(i, j) with a VARIABLE step is the generator icont makes of it (ceo CEO-631).
#
# MEASURED 2026-09-12 on b35ed8e2a: `every write(seq(1, x) \ 2)` raised "scrip: error 22: Undefined function called" in both
# modes while `seq(x, 1)` and `seq(1, 1)` answered 1 2 -- lower_seq required a CONSTANT step (icn_const_step) and returned
# nothing for a variable one, so the call fell to the generic by-name path where no runtime seq exists. Two IPL programs
# (ipower, iseq: `every i := seq(start, incr) \ limit`) were red on exactly this. Cure: a variable step lowers as
# `i to (if j < 0 then INT64_MIN else INT64_MAX) by j`, a synthesized to-by node handed to lower_to, so the to-by box's own
# sign-aware bound test serves both directions. Arms (one witness, seven seq shapes, both modes, byte-identical to icont):
# variable start, variable step, literal both, one argument, NEGATIVE variable step, both variable, omitted start.
# FAIL_ONCE=1 corrupts the negative-step line of the captured stream to prove the diff arm trips.
