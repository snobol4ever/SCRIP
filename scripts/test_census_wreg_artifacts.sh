# test_census_wreg_artifacts.sh — WREG r10/r11 ARTIFACT-LEVEL CLAIM CENSUS (GOAL-SN4-HOME-WIRES, rung W-0).
#
# ⛔ WHY THIS FILE EXISTS.  test_gate_wreg_claim.sh sweeps SOURCES.  The r10 clobber that broke the WREG board
# (FINDING-2026-08-11-CLAUDE-SN46-WREG-BOARD-DEAD-MATCH-END-CLOBBERS-R10) did not live in a source grep's
# reach — it lived in EMITTED CODE, and that FINDING says so verbatim: "WREG-0's claim gate was designed to
# catch this, but it sweeps sources — the clobber lives in emitted asm.  An artifact-level grep would have
# caught it at build time."  W-0 makes that explicit: "grep is insufficient — objdump the emitted slab too."
# This script is that second half.  It answers a DIFFERENT question from the source gate:
#   source gate  = "who MENTIONS r10/r11 in a template?"          (scope, pre-emission)
#   THIS script  = "what actually WRITES r10/r11 in shipped code?" (claim reality, post-emission)
# A template can be clean and the shipped byte still clobber, via a raw-byte encoder, a hand-asm .S, or a
# C compiler's own allocation inside the runtime.  Only this side sees those.
#
# ⛔ WRITES, NOT MENTIONS.  A read of r10 is harmless to a wire; a WRITE destroys it.  Mentions conflate the
# two and inflate the number — the s14/s15b instrument-units conviction, in a new costume.  Destination is
# operand 1 in Intel syntax, so `-M intel` is mandatory here and push/cmp/test are excluded as non-writing.
#
# ⛔ SELF-TEST FIRST (s15b law): a silent zero from a grep is a CLAIM ABOUT TEXT.  Patterns are proven against
# a synthetic objdump line before a single number is reported; failure ⇒ exit 2, report nothing.
