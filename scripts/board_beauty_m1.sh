# board_beauty_m1.sh — ⭐ THE M1 PROGRESS BOARD (s183, HQ Fable).
#
#   bash scripts/board_beauty_m1.sh [--modes m3|m4|both] [--rungs "1 2 5 ..."] [--bisect]
#
# ⛔ WHY THIS EXISTS.  MILESTONE 1 was a BINARY fact — beauty either self-hosts or it does not — and a binary
# fact cannot be delegated: there is exactly one rung and one seat can hold it.  This board makes M1 a LADDER
# by feeding beauty INCREASING PREFIXES OF ITS OWN SOURCE, so "how much of itself can beauty handle" becomes a
# number that moves.  Every red rung it names is an independently dispatchable row, which is what lets the
# fleet work M1 in parallel instead of queueing behind one seat.
#
# THE ORACLE IS THE JUDGE, NOT THE INPUT FILE — for PREFIX rungs only.  ⭐ s267 CORRECTION (was: graded every
# rung, including the full file, against `sbl` on beauty.sno itself): beauty.sno now opens the BEAUTY-CN
# `&`-constant namespace (`&USER_DECLARED_CONSTANTS`, line 9) — a SCRIP extension stock SPITBOL has no keyword
# for.  `sbl -bf` refuses at line 10 but exits rc=0 and prints its error TO STDOUT, so a harness that diffs
# stdout against expected output grades SCRIP's correct answer against an ORACLE ERROR MESSAGE — a false RED on
# every single rung, including the trivial one-line one (FINDING-2026-08-23-hq_P-the-m1-board-grades-beauty-
# against-an-oracle-that-refuses-it.md; independently cross-validated FINDING-2026-08-23-seat15-m1-board-judge-
# is-a-refusing-oracle.md).  Root cause is a known, tracked language-support gap (ARCH-SN4-CONSTANTS.md "Oracle
# amplification"; GOAL-SCRIP-HQ.md D-12/D-13, the `sbl-x`/`csnobol4-x` amplified-oracle pair, READY/queued) —
# this board works around it two ways, permanently, not just until D-12 lands:
#   THE FULL-FILE RUNG *is* MILESTONE 1 (Lon ruling s117): the checked-in beauty.sno is its OWN oracle.  Judge =
#   `cmp` against the INPUT FILE, byte-identical is the fixed point.  No SPITBOL involved, none needed.
#   PREFIX RUNGS grade against the live oracle on `beauty_classic.sno` — a FROZEN pre-BEAUTY-CN snapshot (last
#   commit before `53dd9ac0d`), portable SPITBOL, verified a fixed point of itself on BOTH engines the day this
#   was written.  A prefix of a `&`-constant program is not SPITBOL-gradable in principle (`&USER_DECLARED_
#   CONSTANTS` sits on line 9, inside every rung); a prefix of the frozen classic file still is.  Treat
#   `beauty_classic.sno` like `corpus/generated/` — pinned, never hand-edited, exists purely as a ladder target.
# ⛔ NO md5 IS EVER PINNED ANYWHERE IN THIS FILE (GOAL-SNOBOL4-100 DOD item 2) — both the oracle and the
# milestone's own input file are re-read fresh every run; a pinned hash goes stale the instant either file
# legitimately changes, silently, which is exactly the class of mistake that produced the bug this rewrite fixes.
# ⛔ REFUSE, NEVER DIFF (V2-5 `lib_gate.sh` discipline): rc=0 does not prove the oracle beautified anything on
# THIS box — verified `sbl -bf` exits 0 on its own refusal — so every oracle call is also sniffed for its own
# error-citation shape (`") : ERROR "`) and tagged `ORACLE-REFUSED`, excluded from both pass and fail tallies,
# never silently diffed as if it were real output.
#
# ⛔ `-bf` is REQUIRED and the reason is the LANGUAGE, not beauty: SPITBOL case-folds names by default (manual p.23/28) and SCRIP is CASE-SENSITIVE,
# so `-b` grades against a language SCRIP may not speak.  The `-b` SIGSEGV is DOWNSTREAM -- folding manufactures a phantom ERROR 217 duplicate label
# (`shift`/`Shift`, semantic.inc(16)) and SPITBOL cores in error RECOVERY; a GENUINE duplicate label SIGSEGVs under `-bf` too.  Under `-b` beauty has no
# stable oracle at all (3 runs: rc 139, three different md5s at 1079 bytes; `-bf`: rc 0, 40970 bytes, one md5).  s189 seat2.  m4 links out/libscrip_rt.so.
#
# ⭐ FIRST READING (s183, SCRIP 3da13598, m3): 3/10 rungs green, first red at 10 lines; --bisect named the exact
# first failing line as LINE 8 = the bare label START (lines 1-7 are comments and pass).  From there the wall
# reduced BY HAND to two INDEPENDENT classes, checked into corpus as beauty/m1_lad_*.in with live-oracle .refs:
#   CLASS A -- SEGV when beauty *COMPLETES* the parse; oracle returns the IDENTITY.  1-9 byte witnesses:
#             m1_lad_empty "\n" · m1_lad_barelabel "X\n" · m1_lad_end "END\n" · m1_lad_comment "* hi\nEND\n"
#             (the last PRINTS "* hi" CORRECTLY AND THEN DIES -- so the crash is in the completion/output path).
#   CLASS B -- `Parse Error` where the oracle beautifies; bails before ever reaching class A:
#             m1_lad_stmt · m1_lad_labelstmt · m1_lad_two · m1_lad_match.
# They are SEQUENTIAL IN A RUN but INDEPENDENT IN THE CODE, so they are two rows worked in PARALLEL.  (This note
# also restores the words a backtick ate out of this file's own commit message -- history is not force-rewritten
# with seats pulling; the record is corrected in place, which is where a reader looks anyway.)
#
# ⛔ AN INPUT WITHOUT AN `END` IS NOT A PROGRAM.  beauty parses a WHOLE program; feed it a fragment and the
# ORACLE ITSELF answers with EMPTY OUTPUT, so any verdict built on that input is meaningless.  HQ's first cut of
# the class-B inputs had exactly this defect and was caught before dispatch.  Every ladder input ends with END.
