# test_gate_icn_semicolon_required.sh — THE PRISON for the ICON SEMICOLON-REQUIRED FACT RULE.
#
# SCRIP Icon REQUIRES an explicit ';' between bare statements. The Icon front-end does NO newline
# processing: a newline is plain whitespace and NEVER becomes a statement separator. Newline-to-
# semicolon insertion (the canonical icont "Beginner/Ender" rule) is FORBIDDEN in this codebase.
#
# This gate is structural AND behavioral, in three independent locks. A reintroduction of newline
# insertion must defeat ALL THREE to pass, which it cannot:
#
#   LOCK 1 (negative grep) — the Icon lexer/parser source carries ZERO newline-insertion machinery:
#       no Beginner/Ender token classification, no newline-crossing detection, no synthetic-token
#       buffering whose purpose is separator insertion. Comments are stripped first.
#
#   LOCK 2 (mint-site) — TK_SEMICOL is MINTED in the Icon lexer ONLY from the literal ';' character.
#       The number of make_tok(TK_SEMICOL,...) sites in icon_lex.c must be exactly 1 (the `case ';'`).
#       (The parser CONSUMES TK_SEMICOL freely; this lock is about where it is PRODUCED.)
#
#   LOCK 3 (behavioral canary) — the actual language behavior is pinned, independent of identifier
#       names. A two-bare-statement program separated only by a NEWLINE MUST FAIL to parse; the same
#       program with an explicit ';' MUST parse. If someone adds insertion, the newline canary starts
#       parsing and this lock trips.
#
# Usage: bash scripts/test_gate_icn_semicolon_required.sh        # HARD gate (exit 1 on any breach)
