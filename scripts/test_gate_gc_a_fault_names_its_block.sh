# test_gate_gc_a_fault_names_its_block.sh -- RUNG 2 OF ARCH-GC § 9, MEASURED.
#
# ⛔⭐ THE ROW.  Rung 1 (test_gate_gc_a_stale_read_of_vacated_ground_faults_and_names_its_block.sh) turned a silent
# wrong answer into a located crash: the vacated pages go PROT_NONE and the handler names the ADDRESS.  An address
# is not a defect.  Rung 2 is the BLOCK BIRTH LEDGER -- a side table, never a header field, because rt_hblk_t is
# sixteen bytes and CHANGING THE BLOCK LAYOUT CHANGES THE THING BEING TESTED -- so the fault prints the block's
# allocation serial, its type at birth and the site that allocated it.  ARCH-GC § 9's own example is the contract:
# "block #12345, DT_X, allocated by rt_heap_strdup_c from SNO$MKEXPR".
#
# ⛔ WHY THE SUBJECT IS A FIXTURE THIS GATE PLANTS ITSELF.  A trap's acceptance may never be somebody else's open
# defect: the day they cure it the arm goes DARK and reads as a pass (cfo 2026-09-21, the rung-1 finding).  So the
# subject is a fixture whose birth identity this gate knows INDEPENDENTLY of the runtime -- it counts its own
# allocations -- and arm (b) is the whole point: the fixture allocates 3000 blocks, collects them ALL, then
# allocates 3000 more and goes stale on the 1500th of the SECOND batch.  Its birth serial is 4500 while its
# position in the vacated ledger is 1500, so an instrument that reports the ledger index instead of the serial
# CANNOT pass this arm.  That is not hypothetical: the first cut of this cure reported 1500, because phase B
# re-uses phase A's addresses and the ring lookup returned the older birth.  A one-phase fixture would have
# shipped it -- serial and index coincide there.
#
# ⛔ ARM (d) IS THE INSTRUMENT-MUST-CLAIM-THE-EVENT RULE.  A birth ring is finite.  With a ring too small to hold
# the record, the report must SAY the record is gone and must NEVER name a different block -- naming the wrong
# block is worse than naming none, which is the whole class this rung exists to remove.
#
# FAIL_ONCE=1 runs every naming arm with the ledger OFF and requires (b), (c1..c3) and (d) to red; (a) and (e)
# are the arms that describe the ledger-off world, so they stay green by construction and are not fail-once arms.
