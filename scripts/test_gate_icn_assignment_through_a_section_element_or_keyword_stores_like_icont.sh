# test_gate_icn_assignment_through_a_section_element_or_keyword_stores_like_icont.sh -- cfo 2026-09-11,
# NONET, closing two rank-0 rows ON MEASUREMENT rather than on a cure.
#
# WHAT IT PINS, AND WHY A GATE AND NOT A FLIP. Two rank-0 FREE rows said these shapes were FATAL:
# `icon-assignment-through-a-substring-or-element-variable-lvalue-aborts-the-emitter` (s[i:j] := x, !x := v
# and ?x := v aborted at compile time in emit_drive's IR_ASSIGN guard, killing arizona errors.icn and
# evalx.icn before either printed a line) and `icon-keyword-assignment-beyond-pos-and-random-bombs`
# (bb_keyword_assign implemented only &pos/&random, killing arizona traps.icn at line 2 of 17). BOTH READ
# CURED when measured on 4b1c47897: errors, evalx and traps diff ZERO lines against their .std in BOTH
# modes, in both the arizona and jcon copies, and the shapes below are byte-identical to icont 9.5.25a.
# ⛔ NOTHING IN `make test` HELD THEM. The only thing keeping these two classes honest was three graded
# suite files, which are read at BOARD cadence -- one pass per landing batch, by the one runner -- so a
# regression could ride for a whole batch. A row leaving the queue must not take its pin with it; that is
# the standing lesson row `snobol4-a-cure-proven-on-a-program-that-leaves-the-denominator-owes-a-gate`.
#
# ⭐ WANTS ARE CUT FROM THE ORACLE AT RUN TIME, NEVER TYPED. Typing a want for a cure that already landed
# records what the tree does today, not what Icon does -- it would green on the day it was written by
# construction. icont/iconx 9.5.25a is asked for every byte, and a missing oracle REFUSES (rc=2) rather
# than grading against an empty file.
# ⛔ EVERY WITNESS CARRIES SEMICOLONS: SCRIP's Icon frontend does ZERO newline processing (RULES.md), so a
# witness written the way icont accepts it dies in the parser and the gate would grade a parse error
# against real output. Both arms are written to parse under both engines.
# ⛔ THE ARMS ARE WRITE-SIDE ONLY and that is the point: `test_gate_icn_subscript_index_is_checked...` is
# already wired and pins subscript READS and their error accounts. It never stores through one.
# ⭐ A2 READS EVERY KEYWORD BACK AFTER ASSIGNING IT. Assigning and not reading would pass on a runtime that
# accepted the store and dropped it -- which is exactly what &subject did before CFO-45 (the Icon path
# assigns through rt_keyword_subject_set, NOT the general keyword store). &pos is read after &subject to
# catch the reset-to-1 that a subject store owes.
#
# ⛔ HOW IT WAS PROVEN TO DISCRIMINATE, HONESTLY STATED. The cures predate this HEAD by many commits and
# were NOT reverted to watch the gate go red -- a full revert of two classes across lower/emit was not paid
# for. Instead each arm was mutation-proved: one byte perturbed in each cut want reds that arm in both
# modes (measured, 4 of 4), so no arm is comparing empty to empty or empty to itself. The want-sanity block
# below makes that structural: an arm whose cut want is short or missing its discriminating token REFUSES.
