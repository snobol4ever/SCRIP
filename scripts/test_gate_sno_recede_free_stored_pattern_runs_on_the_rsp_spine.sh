# THE RSP SPINE SUFFICES (Lon 2026-09-30 07:2x CDT, in-chat to the ceo, verbatim: "Ensure that pre-compiled patterns do no carry the
# extra weight of an RBP activation frame when just the RSP spine will suffice."; GOAL-CEO.md CEO-1366; the BB FRAME-PLACEMENT
# CRITERION, RULES.md, Lon 2026-08-27: RESULT/LOCALS stay on the RSP spine iff every consumer reaches them at a fixed compile-time
# offset on every path, and move to an RBP frame the moment a gamma->beta window with unbounded activity between can intervene).
#
# THE WITNESS: p1 is recede-free and holds no value -- POS, LIT, SPAN, ANY, LEN, BREAK, LIT and RPOS: no box in it can be receded into
# after gamma (a beta into any of them fails straight through to omega) and none keeps a DESCR, so its PAT$ thunk has no gamma->beta
# window, nothing for the collector to see, and needs no frame, no map cell and no zero-fill. p2 holds an alternation and p3 an ARBNO,
# each a recede window, so their thunks keep the frame -- the control: a framed-needed shape run frameless is this gate's red as much
# as a recede-free one framed. NOT GRADED HERE, the row's next steps: a pattern whose frame holds only RAW scratch (SPAN, BREAK and
# ANY save the cursor through rbp today) or a pending assignment's DESCR keeps its frame today by the EMITTER's placement, not by any
# collector need -- the collector visits a tagged DESCR cell on the RSP spine by its tag (gc_walk_words; ARCH-GC-COMPILE-TIME-FRAME-
# MAPS.md section 2b, the spine carries its own types; Lon's question of 2026-09-30, answered by measurement). The thunks are
# read from the mode-4 .s by their FN__PAT$n labels in source order (p1 = PAT$0, p2 = PAT$1, p3 = PAT$2); a thunk is FRAMED when the
# text between FN__PAT$n and PAT$n_omega carries "mov rbp, rsp". The program's output must equal sbl -bf in both modes whatever the
# frames read. MEASURED RED at de0302f83: every thunk is framed (PAT$0 carries push rbp / mov rbp, rsp / sub rsp, 88, the map cell and
# the zero-fill). Exit 0 = p1 frameless, p2 and p3 framed, both modes = the oracle; 1 = otherwise; 2 = cannot measure.
