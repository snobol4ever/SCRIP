# test_gate_no_implicit_declarations.sh -- THE TREE BUILDS WITH ALL WARNINGS OFF, SO THE COMPILER CANNOT TELL US A POINTER WAS TRUNCATED.
# ⛔ THE MEASURED DEFECT (ceo 2026-09-18, found while sweeping the four C allocator names): src/parsers/prolog/prolog_driver.c called
# lp_s_expr with NO PROTOTYPE IN SCOPE, so an implicit int-returning declaration TRUNCATED THE RETURNED tree_t* TO 32 BITS. It was
# invisible for as long as it has existed because libc's brk heap sits below 4 GiB -- and it became FATAL on the first Prolog compile
# the moment the compile-time arena moved to mmap at 0x7ffff. Makefile line 46 is WARN := -w, and it flows into CBASE, CXXRT and all
# four runtime object rules, so no compiler in this tree has ever said a word about it.
# ⛔ WHY THIS IS A GATE AND NOT A TIDY-UP (cfo 2026-09-18): the eradication of malloc/calloc/realloc/free converts ~1880 call sites to
# NEW functions (ct_alloc, rt_ws_alloc, the mmap wrappers). Every converted file that lacks the declaring header gets exactly the
# prolog_driver.c bug, and both the arena AND the collected heap now live high, so the truncation is fatal rather than latent. This
# gate is the one free instrument that grades that landing, and it costs no build.
# HOW IT MEASURES: `make -n -B` hands over the REAL per-file compile command (the union of every -I is NOT faithful -- it picks up the
# wrong headers and both invents and masks findings; measured 210 spurious errors that way). Each C command is replayed with -w swapped
# for the three truncating warning classes and with -c/-o/-MMD/-MP stripped for -fsyntax-only, so the gate writes NO object and NO .d
# sidecar and cannot disturb another seat's in-flight build.
# SCOPE, NOT A COUNT RATCHET: scripts/implicit_decl_scope.txt lists the directories that must read zero. Everything else is measured and
# PRINTED WITH ITS OWNER but cannot fail the run -- a scope ratchet cannot go stale the way a count baseline does.
# ⛔ REFUSES rc=2 RATHER THAN PASSING VACUOUSLY: if make -n fails, if fewer than 80 C translation units are found, or if any replayed
# unit reports an error: (which would mean the replay is not faithful and its silence proves nothing).
