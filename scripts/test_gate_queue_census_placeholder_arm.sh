# test_gate_queue_census_placeholder_arm.sh — the invariant gate for class P of util_queue_visibility_census.py
# (ceo ruling CEO-289, 2026-09-05, from hq_P's 44-baton FINDING; built by hq_T).
#
# WHAT IT PROTECTS.  A baton whose DONE-WHEN is still the mint skeleton is UNCLOSABLE: `done` executes that
# line whole, prose is not a command, so a seat can do the whole job correctly and get a refusal that is
# INDISTINGUISHABLE from the one a genuinely wrong cure produces.  Class E cannot catch it — the DONE-WHEN
# line EXISTS, it is just not runnable.
#
# ⛔⭐ THE PROPERTY THIS GATE ACTUALLY DEFENDS IS THE KEY, NOT THE COUNT.  The obvious instrument — grep the
# placeholder text over the whole task file — OVER-REPORTS BY 2.5x (112 against a true 44, measured by hq_P
# 2026-09-05), because ledger lines, handoff notes and QA answers MENTION the placeholder; two of the false
# hits were lines hq_P had written an hour earlier recording that they had REMOVED one.  The instrument
# counted the cure as the disease, and it failed in the INFLATING direction, which is the more persuasive
# one — a scary number invites action rather than scrutiny.  So ARM 2 is the load-bearing arm: a baton with a
# REAL DONE-WHEN that merely mentions the placeholder in its prose must NOT be counted, and ARM 3 proves that
# is a real discrimination by showing the whole-file grep does count it.
#
# Every arm runs against a SYNTHETIC postoffice via S4E_PO — this gate never reads, and never writes, the
# live /home/resources/postoffice.  Offline, sub-second.
