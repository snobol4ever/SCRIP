# Exercises BOTH cures in a fully isolated sandbox postoffice (S4E_POST override) plus S4E_QUEUE/S4E_QUEUE_DONE
# overrides for the audit script -- never touches the live /home/resources/postoffice.
#   cure 1: `s4e_msg.sh park <topic> BLOCKED-ON:<dangling>` REFUSES rc=2, leaves QUEUE.tsv untouched.
#           A real-blocker park, a swept-done-blocker park, an unpark to FREE, and a plain PARKED (no colon
#           blocker at all) must all still SUCCEED -- this is a refusal of ONE new bad shape, not a regression
#           in ordinary park usage.
#   cure 2: `util_queue_dangling_blocker.sh` reports the dangling row (rc=1) and stays silent (rc=0) once
#           repaired, and correctly does NOT flag a blocker that is a live row or an already swept-done one.
#
# usage: bash scripts/test_gate_dangling_blocker_refused.sh
# exit:  0 = both cures behave correctly   1 = a behavioral check failed   2 = REFUSES (cannot set up the sandbox)
