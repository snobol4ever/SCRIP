# test_gate_gc_map_table_present_in_both_media.sh -- rung 2 of the compile-time frame maps
# (ARCH-GC-COMPILE-TIME-FRAME-MAPS.md section 6, F1; row
# gc-the-compile-time-map-table-is-emitted-beside-the-code-in-both-media-...).
#
# WHAT THIS GATE HOLDS. Rung 1 (CTO-65) gave every activation frame a DT_MAP cell naming a 32-byte
# static map, and gave both media an install path: mode 3 registers each chain's map through
# rt_gc_frame_maps_add as it seals it, mode 4 emits a counted __gc_frame_maps .rodata table that
# main's prologue hands to rt_gc_frame_maps_install_counted. NOTHING READ THE TABLE BACK. The only
# reporter in the tree was SCRIP_GC_MAPS_REPORT, which prints what the EMITTER intended at compile
# time -- it cannot see a table that was emitted and never installed, and it cannot see the two media
# disagreeing. This gate reads the installed table back at RUN time through the one runtime symbol
# rt_gc_frame_maps() (SCRIP_GC_MAPS_DUMP=1) in BOTH media and requires the two readings to agree
# entry for entry.
#
# ⛔ WHAT THE READ-BACK FOUND THE FIRST TIME IT RAN (2026-09-18, cto), which is the whole argument for
# grading the artefact instead of the intent -- TWO cross-media identity divergences, both invisible
# to every instrument that existed:
#   (1) THE ENTRY GRAPH HAD TWO NAMES. The driver emits the program's main flat chain as the literal
#       "pat_flat" in mode 3 (scrip.c) and "main" in mode 4, so one graph's map carried two identities.
#       The fact was already KNOWN and PAPERED OVER in two other places rather than cured: util_gc_census.py
#       carried ENTRY_ALIAS = ("pat_flat", "main"), and emit.cpp tested both spellings. Three copies of
#       one fact, held by memory rather than by a check -- which is the state the INSTRUMENT LAWS exist
#       to end. Cured at the source: the map's graph_name is normalised once, in one named function.
#   (2) THE ASSEMBLER MANGLING LEAKED INTO THE MAP. Mode 4 must pass an assembler-legal prefix, so the
#       driver passes asm_sym_name(pname); mode 3 passes the raw name. The map's graph_name is DATA read
#       by the collector and the census, not a symbol, and it was taking whichever spelling the medium
#       needed: a Prolog program named every one of its ~160 graphs app/3, write/1, =../2 in mode 3 and
#       app$2F3, write$2F1, =..$2F2 in mode 4. Geometry agreed; identity did not. Cured by having the map
#       carry the graph's TRUE name (zls_graph_name_get) in both media while labels keep their mangling.
#   Neither divergence corrupts memory today, because the walker reaches a map through the frame's cell
#   rather than by name. Both make the map LIE about which graph a frame belongs to, and a collector
#   that guesses nothing cannot be built on metadata that does.
#
# ⛔ THE EXCLUSION THIS PARAGRAPH USED TO NAME IS RETIRED (cto, 2026-09-19, row gc-the-blob-frame-interior-takes-one-
# static-layout...): a SNOBOL4 stored-pattern blob frame (emit.cpp R-4(b)) now stores a DT_MAP cell at the bottom of
# its carve and its map carries GC_FRAME_MAP_BLOB plus a static layout of the interior (ARCH-GC section 6.2e), so it
# appears in BOTH media's tables like every other frame graph and this gate's read-back covers it; the layout itself
# is graded by test_gate_gc_the_blob_frame_interior_is_a_static_layout.sh.
#
# ⛔ THE SEVEN-FRONTEND WIDENING (2026-09-18, cto, on the ceo's word CEO-845). The gate shipped with THREE
# witnesses -- Icon, SNOBOL4, Prolog -- and three witnesses cannot see a divergence in the other four frontends.
# That is a blindfold, not a scope: the two divergences this gate FOUND were both properties of the DRIVER and the
# EMITTER, which every frontend passes through, so a fourth one could land in Snocone, Raku, Pascal or Rebus and
# read green here forever. Under ONE RUNNER (CEO-523) a seat may not reach for a board to cover that gap, so the
# gap is covered where it belongs -- in the hermetic gate, with one witness per frontend, all seven read back
# through the same runtime symbol in both media. Measured at the widening: Raku and Pascal carry TWO graphs each
# (main plus a called function), and SNOBOL4, Snocone and Rebus carry exactly ONE, because a DEFINE'd SNOBOL4
# function, a Snocone `function` and a Rebus `function` all lower INTO the program's flat chain rather than into a
# graph of their own. That is why arm 1 prints each witness's population instead of asserting a floor it would
# have to invent: a one-entry table is the truth for a flat-chain frontend, and a ZERO-entry table is still a red.
#
# ARMS (all blocking): (1) PRESENT -- each witness installs a NON-EMPTY table in BOTH media, read back
# through the one runtime symbol; (2) AGREE -- the two readings are identical entry for entry (graph
# name, frame_bytes, header_bytes, flags), across ALL SEVEN frontends; (3) IDENTITY -- the entry graph is
# named "main" in both media and no entry carries the assembler mangling tell ($2F), which is the
# regression guard for the two divergences above; (4) PLANTED -- SCRIP_GC_MAPTAB_PLANT=1 on the mode-4
# compile alone must make the two readings DISAGREE: a guard never seen to fire is not known to hold
# (CEO-554), and if this comes back green the read-back has stopped reading. Arm 4 plants in ALL SEVEN
# frontends, not just the first: a fail-once demonstrated in Icon says nothing about whether the Rebus or
# Pascal read-back discriminates, and an arm that never fired for a frontend has not measured it.
