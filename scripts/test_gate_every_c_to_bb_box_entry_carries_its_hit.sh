# test_gate_every_c_to_bb_box_entry_carries_its_hit.sh -- THE C->BB POPULATION IS COUNTED OVER HOOKED SITES ONLY,
# SO AN UNHOOKED ENTRY AND A DEAD ENTRY READ THE SAME. THIS GATE MAKES THAT IMPOSSIBLE TO REPEAT.
#
# ⛔⭐ WHY THIS EXISTS, MEASURED AND NOT ARGUED (cto 2026-09-21, CTO-88, under the C->BB->C->BB eradication,
# Lon 2026-09-21 17:0x / RULES.md line 238 FACT RULE / CEO-1086).  The ceo swept the whole SNOBOL4 master under
# SCRIP_C2BB_TRACE and reported 1062 live transitions over six live site names, with FOUR static sites reading
# ZERO and correctly called BOUNDED rather than dead.  That census could not see the roads that carry no
# rt_c2bb_hit AT ALL.  THREE SUCH ROADS EXISTED AND ALL THREE WERE IN THE cto's HALF:
#   * rk_gram_run_native / rk_gram_enter_box (by_name_dispatch.c, rt_gram_trampoline.S) -- a SECOND non-tail
#     C-frame entry into a box, holding char fb[256] on the C stack across the entry and choosing the port in C
#     with (r.v != DT_FAIL).  The ceo's telegram named rt.c:1194 as THE LAST non-tail C-frame call in the tree;
#     it was the last HOOKED one.  This road was never in any census because it was never hooked.
#     ⭐ DELETED 2026-09-21 on Lon's order, and NOT on a zero trace -- on the MECHANISM.  Under gdb, on a program
#     carrying both a grammar and a sub, rt_proc_set_fn fires for the sub and NEVER for the grammar rule, while
#     rt_proc_get_fn("gram__G__TOP") RETURNS NULL: lower_raku builds those graphs but nothing registers them, so
#     bf was null on every path and both guarded calls were unreachable by construction.  The NFA road is the
#     working implementation.  rt_gram_trampoline.S went with it, hence its absence from ENTRY_PRIMS below.
#     ⛔ IT WAS DEAD BECAUSE A FEATURE WAS BUILT AND NEVER WIRED, not because it was retired -- the unwired
#     gram__ graphs are hq_raku's question and are deliberately NOT resolved by this deletion.
#   * rt_chain_enter / rt_chain_enter_v -- the EVAL/CODE and computed-GOTO road, FIVE call sites in
#     runtime_eval.c, all unhooked.  MEASURED LIVE the moment it was hooked: a six-line SNOBOL4 program whose
#     only dynamic construct is EVAL('3 + 4') fires chain.eval.v.  That transition was invisible to the 1062.
# ⛔ THE ERROR CLASS IS THE ONE LON FIRED A SEAT OVER AT CEO-1069 -- "0 of 49 is a STATIC site count and a zero
# over it is a BLINDFOLD, not a clean bill" -- reappearing INSIDE the job created to cure it.  A zero from an
# instrument nobody proved live is not evidence, and the cure for that is a check, never a paragraph.
#
# ⭐ WHAT THE GATE ASSERTS: every CALL SITE of a primitive that enters a box from C carries an rt_c2bb_hit on its
# own line or within the three lines above it.  The primitive list is DECLARED below rather than discovered, so a
# NEW entry primitive is a deliberate edit to this file and not a silent addition.
# ⛔ THE SANCTIONED EXCEPTIONS ARE DECLARED BY NAME AND ARE THE ONLY ONES (CEO-970): the coroutine start
# (genp.spine / genp.spine.n2), scrip.c's main invocation through rt_outer_call, and scrip_coexpr_trampoline_entry.
# An exception is a NAME here, never a pattern, because a pattern quietly admits its next sibling.
#
# ⭐ FAIL-ONCE IS BUILT IN: FAIL_ONCE=1 strips the hit from one real site in a scratch copy and requires the gate
# to red on it.  A census that cannot fail is the instrument this gate exists to catch.
