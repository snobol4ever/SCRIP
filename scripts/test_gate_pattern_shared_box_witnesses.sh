# test_gate_pattern_shared_box_witnesses.sh -- seat18's FLEET-20 walk under hq_U (row
# pattern-engine-shared-box-witness-set-with-oracle-cut-refs, task minted by hq_U 2026-09-05T18:15:50Z).
#
# WHAT THIS IS: a minimal-witness set for the shared Byrd boxes SNOBOL4 patterns exercise -- operand
# parking per site, ARBNO, SPAN/ANY/BREAK snapshots, capture -- graded m3+m4 against the live `sbl -bf`
# oracle, with each witness's port trace checked (killswitch, no-perturbation, self-pin against
# refs_pattern_shared_box_witnesses.trace). "The seat witnesses, hq_U cures" (GOAL-HQ-UNIFY.md) --
# this gate only WITNESSES; it does not itself attempt any cure.
#
# ⛔⭐ THE SEED PAIR NAMED IN THE TASK BRIEF IS STALE -- CURED BEFORE THE TASK WAS EVEN MINTED. The brief
# pointed at FINDING-2026-09-05-hq_C-outer-capture-reads-its-own-home-...md sec 1 as "red today" (that
# FINDING itself was committed .github 80c773c70, 2026-09-04T21:14:49-05:00, and says so honestly at the
# time it was written). But its own follow-up, FINDING-2026-09-05-hq_C-flat-alternation-leaves-32-live-
# bytes-...md (.github b5370143b, 2026-09-04T23:54:20-05:00 -- ~2.5h later, and still ~13h before this
# task's 2026-09-05T18:15:50Z mint time), records the landed cure: SCRIP `0a1a94239`, the `alt_flat_live_
# bytes()` clause in the `_xh` hop loop at src/emitter/emit.cpp (search `IR_MATCH_ALTERNATE) { _xh +=`).
# Verified empirically THIS session, both ways: `git checkout 70f7b562e -- src/emitter/emit.cpp` (the
# parent of the cure commit) reproduces COMMON=[] exactly as the stale FINDING describes; `git checkout
# HEAD -- src/emitter/emit.cpp` (today's tree) matches the oracle. Groups 1-3 below are therefore
# REGRESSION PINS on an already-cured class, not open class rows -- EXPECTED to PASS today, and a witness
# going RED means the cure regressed, not "still broken". See
# FINDING-2026-09-05-seat18-pattern-shared-box-witness-walk.md for the full writeup.
#
# THE FOUR GROUPS:
#   capture            cap_pin_break   -- the seed pair itself (SCRIP 0a1a94239).
#   span-any-break     cap_pin_any, cap_pin_notany, cap_pin_span -- seat18's OWN construction, same
#                      LEN(1)-then-alternation shape as the seed with ANY/NOTANY/SPAN swapped in for
#                      BREAK, EACH independently verified this session to reproduce pre-cure (against
#                      70f7b562e) and pass post-cure -- new coverage the original FINDING never checked.
#   operand-parking    park_pin_seize -- FINDING-2026-09-05-hq_C-a-deferred-patterns-live-depth-...md's
#                      own decisive witness verbatim (SCRIP 2243452ad): one compiled capture site, called
#                      twice with a SEIZE local bound to two different patterns, so the SAME site must
#                      park and re-find two different operand shapes. As close to "operand parking per
#                      site" as this codebase's own vocabulary gets.
#   arbno              arbno_pin_reentry -- an OPEN class row, not a regression pin, credited to seat14's
#                      independent isolation this same session (FINDING-2026-09-05-seat14-arbno-frame-arm-
#                      hangs-re-entering-a-choice-bearing-body.md, routed to hq_U there already -- this
#                      gate does not re-route it, only adopts the already-isolated witness for standing
#                      coverage). `ARBNO(<body>)` with an internally-choice-bearing body (an alternation)
#                      HANGS on re-entry -- a genuine non-terminating cycle in `bb_match_arbno_frame()`,
#                      confirmed independently this session against the real master-suite entry
#                      (`probe_passthru__ptw_min_defer2_hang`, already carried as `arbno_pos_rpos_branch_81`
#                      xfail=1). EXPECTED verdict today is FAIL/timeout -- this is the one group where a
#                      witness going GREEN is the news (hq_U's cure landed), never a gate violation.
#
# capture/span-any-break share ONE passing control (cap_ctrl: the alternation replaced by bare REM, which
# is semantically equivalent on this subject -- LEN(1) already exhausts the remaining char, so either
# alternation arm or bare REM matches zero more characters; the ONLY structural difference is whether the
# second concat element is an IR_DISJUNCTION node, which is precisely what isolates this class). arbno has
# its own control, arbno_ctrl (ARBNO with a choice-free body -- terminates fine, isolates the alternation
# as the ingredient exactly as seat14's own v1/v6 pair does).
#
# PORT TRACE CHECK, per witness, mode-4 (the medium `--compile` makes inspectable):
#   (1) KILLSWITCH: .s with SCRIP_PL_TRACE unset and =0 are byte-identical; =1 differs.
#   (2) NO PERTURBATION: stdout+rc identical with/without the trace, both m3 and m4.
#   (3) THE INSTRUMENT FIRES: SCRIP_PL_TRACE=1 produces a nonzero normalised port-trace line count.
#   (4) SELF-PIN: the normalised trace matches refs_pattern_shared_box_witnesses.trace (--cut rewrites
#       it). ⛔ Same doctrine as lib_port_trace.sh: this is a SELF-consistency pin, not an oracle diff --
#       it proves the port sequence has not MOVED, never that it is right. This gate does not reuse
#       lib_port_trace.sh itself because that library is shaped around the master-suite ladder (families,
#       rungs, --to/--only over corpus/tests/<lang>/ALL.csv); these witnesses are not master-suite members
#       (deliberately -- they are a from-FINDING ad hoc set, not general corpus), so the same four checks
#       are re-implemented directly below over an inline, self-contained witness set instead.
#
# CORRECTNESS CHECK: gate_oracle_stdout_match (lib_gate.sh) against a LIVE `sbl -bf` run per witness, both
# modes -- the same helper test_one_witness.sh uses, not a stored .ref (nothing here is a master entry).
#
# EXIT: 0 every regression-pin witness (groups 1-3) matches the oracle and all port-trace checks pass,
# AND the arbno group's status is one of its two EXPECTED shapes (still hangs, or hq_U's cure landed and
# it now passes -- either is fine; see EXPECT_FAIL below). 1 an ACTUAL regression: a group 1-3 pin went
# red, a killswitch/perturbation/self-pin check failed, or arbno stopped hanging AND stopped matching the
# oracle (neither expected shape -- a NEW, different defect). 2 UNPROVEN (unbuilt scrip, missing oracle,
# or refs missing -- run --cut once to seed refs_pattern_shared_box_witnesses.trace).
