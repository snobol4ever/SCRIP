# test_gate_scratch_is_bounded.sh — the regrow-gate for the 2026-08-23 s267 root-filesystem outage.
#
# WHAT HAPPENED: honest_icon_correctness.sh did `mktemp -d /tmp/icn_corr_XXXXXX` with no cleanup trap and no
# bound on program output, under a caller's `timeout 900`.  deal.icn emitted 6.79GB against the oracle's 285KB,
# the timeout killed the script before cleanup could run, and three abandoned 8-12GB scratch dirs took / to
# 100% and stopped nineteen sessions.  Two files were fixed (e6faa54e, cf937987).  THIS GATE IS THE OTHER HALF:
# two fixes are today, a gate is every day.
#
# ⛔ THE ASYMMETRY THAT MAKES THIS INVISIBLE IN REVIEW, and the reason a gate beats vigilance: on this box
# `/tmp` is on the 125G ROOT partition while `/home` is a separate 503G one.  Nothing in the word "/tmp" says
# that.  A reviewer reading `mktemp -d /tmp/...` sees a normal idiom, not a loaded gun.
#
# TWO CHECKS, DELIBERATELY DIFFERENT STRENGTHS — measured, not assumed (hq_P s267 swept all 289 /tmp-touching
# scripts: 142 already trapped, 49 did not; 25 of those 49 combined untrapped + bare-/tmp mktemp -d; but only
# ONE of the 25 also redirected unbounded PROGRAM output).  So:
#   A. ZERO-ASSERT on the DETONATION-CAPABLE shape (untrapped + bare /tmp + unbounded redirect into the scratch
#      dir).  That set is empty today and must stay empty.  This is the check that would have caught the outage.
#   B. COMPUTED RATCHET on the merely-untidy shape (untrapped + bare /tmp, bounded output).  These leak
#      kilobytes, not gigabytes.  Ranked as hygiene on purpose — denying them borrowed urgency is itself a
#      finding.  The ceiling is measured, never typed; it may shrink, never grow.
