# PROLOG, RUNG 9, THE GAMMA FENCE (CEO-690; Lon 2026-09-13, verbatim: "do a whack-free on GAMMA for a FENCE d
# (i.e. cut !) or otherwise FENCE d operation."). An OPAQUE-GOAL BARRIER -- once/1, the condition of an
# if-then-else, forall/2, (\+)/1 -- can never be re-entered by backtracking whatever its argument goal does,
# so the text of the call site alone proves beta is unreachable and every frame the goal carved is DEAD at
# gamma. Each of these is a cut in effect with no `!` in the text. Before hq_U's fence they were retained for
# a recession that can never come, at 822 to 1254 BYTES OF MACHINE STACK PER LEVEL; the same call lexically
# fenced with `!` cost nothing, which is what made this a defect and not a design limit.
#
# ⛔ THIS GATE GRADES CAPACITY, NOT ANSWERS, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT. Every answer these programs produce
# was RIGHT before the cure and is right after it. A gate that only diffed output would read this entire class
# as green and has done, for as long as the class has existed.
#
# ⛔⭐ THE BUILTIN-GENERATOR ARM IS NOT A SIXTH COPY OF THE FIRST FOUR (cto, 2026-09-13). A barrier's
# reclamation is NOT uniform in the KIND of goal it wraps: findall over a 50-clause fact predicate reaches the
# ceiling while findall over between/3 with TWO solutions does not, so a cure could green every clause-defined
# row here and leave the builtin-generator half untouched with nothing in the table saying so. once_gen is in
# this set so that this instrument can produce that red. It is the arm that was added BEFORE the cure landed
# rather than after, which is the only order in which it is evidence.
#
# ⛔ THE STACK SIZE IS PART OF THE MEASUREMENT AND THIS GATE PINS IT. Unpinned, it grades the shell and not
# the compiler. It sets its own limit in a subshell, PRINTS it, and refuses rc=2 if it cannot.
#
# ⛔⭐ THE SAFETY CONTROL IS THE GRADING CRITERION AND NOT A FOOTNOTE (CEO-690, CEO-550). GAMMA IS THE SHARED
# YIELD PORT FOR SUSPEND AND RETURN, so a generator that suspends through gamma expects to be resumed INTO
# THAT VERY FRAME, and an unconditional whack tears down a frame a redo is about to re-enter. The control is a
# PAIR whose ANSWERS separate the two cases: q(X) un-fenced under a 3-deep recursion has 2^3 solutions and its
# frames MUST be retained; the same recursion with once(q(X)) has exactly 1 and its frames may be released.
# Both swipl-confirmed. IF THE CONTROL MOVES, THE CURE IS WRONG WHATEVER THE DEPTH ARMS SAY.
#
# DONE-WHEN: all five barrier witnesses complete at N=50000 in BOTH modes at the pinned limit (each died
# between 6,689 and 10,204 before the cure), AND the safety control still reads cp(8) once(1).
# EXIT 0 all green; 1 an arm is red (named); 2 REFUSED (could not measure -- never skip-as-success).
