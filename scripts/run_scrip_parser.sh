# Shared runtime — beauty.sno INCLUDE order:
#   global, case, assign, match, counter, stack, tree, ShiftReduce,
#   TDump, Gen, Qize, semantic, omega, trace
# SL-2 (2026-05-17): qize.sc is re-included.  The "Append-through-function-parameter"
# theory recorded earlier was a misdiagnosis — the actual bug was a use-after-free
# in snocone_parse.y's sc_finalize_if_else_pst, triggered by any function with
# three or more chained `else if` clauses (qize.sc's Qize fits that shape).
# Fixed by giving each `if_head` its own heap-allocated IfHead snapshot instead of
# sharing a single ScParseState slot that nested ifs clobbered.

# PST-RB-5e (2026-05-17): lower.sc and lower_driver.sc were deleted from the parser source tree (now SCRIP/bootstrap)

# parsers (snobol4, snocone, icon, prolog, raku, rebus) now emit pure AST via TDump
