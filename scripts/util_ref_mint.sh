# util_ref_mint.sh — MINT `.ref` GROUND TRUTH FROM THE LIVE ORACLE FOR PROGRAMS NO BOARD GRADES (row `ref-the-ungraded-suites`, s191).
#
#   bash scripts/util_ref_mint.sh <suite> <dir> [<dir>...]            # CENSUS ONLY — classify, write nothing
#   bash scripts/util_ref_mint.sh <suite> <dir> [<dir>...] --apply    # mint a .ref beside every LIVE program
#
# ⛔ A SUITE THAT IS NEVER GRADED IS NOT A PASSING SUITE, IT IS AN UNOPENED ONE.  Grading is by `.ref` diff, so a program with no
# `.ref` is invisible to every board -- corpus/snobol4/parser/ held 88 such programs and feat/ 19 more.  These are
# self-checking programs that print their own PASS/FAIL, so they were DESIGNED to be graded.
# ⛔⛔ BUT A .ref MINTED FROM A BROKEN ORACLE RUN PINS A LIE, AND THERE ARE THREE WAYS TO PIN ONE, NOT ONE.  This tool mints ONLY
# on `LIVE` and names every other class instead:
#   DEAD_REPORT -- sbl EXITED 0 WHILE PRINTING A FATAL ERROR DUMP (seat2, s191).  rc is NOT a liveness signal; minting here pins
#                  SPITBOL's error report as the definition of correct, and the program then "passes" forever by failing.
#   EMPTY       -- rc 0 and ZERO BYTES.  A 0-byte .ref grades "produced nothing" as correct.  This is the shape that nearly
#                  manufactured 134 vacuous passes at s191, and it is the most dangerous class precisely because it looks clean.
#   RC<n>/SIG<n>/TIMEOUT -- the oracle could not run the program at all; it has no answer to record.
# ⛔ THE ORACLE IS INVOKED THROUGH `scorecard_snobol4.sh oracle`, NEVER RE-DERIVED HERE.  A .ref minted under a different cwd, lib
# path, stdin or flag set than the board GRADES with is a pin that can never match -- seat5 hit that twice in one session and
# wrote the rule: a census is a harness, copy run_one, never re-derive it.  Validated on a program that already had a pin:
# feat/f13_eval_code minted through this door is BYTE-IDENTICAL to its checked-in .ref.
# ⛔ lon/ AND include/ ARE REFUSED BY CONSTRUCTION, not skipped at run time (RULES.md: lon is a CREDENTIAL rule
# -- do not run, do not read into a transcript; include/ is under HQ's conservative interim pending Lon's boundary ruling).
