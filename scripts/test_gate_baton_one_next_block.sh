# test_gate_baton_one_next_block.sh -- every LIVE postoffice baton (a task file whose QUEUE.tsv row is
# not in a terminal state) carries exactly one `## NEXT` heading -- the ONE block `next`'s own printout
# tells every seat to read. Row: baton-one-next-block-gate. Ruling: ceo 2026-08-29, PROTOCOL.md step 4.
# Evidence: FINDING-2026-08-29-hq_B-baton-next-blocks-carry-two-opposite-conventions-and-icons-five-were-
# scrambled-so-the-top-block-was-false.md (9 of 417 files multi-NEXT, incl. tests-consolidate-icon
# scrambled 3-1-2-5-4 on a LIVE rank-1 row).
#
# ⛔ PATTERN CORRECTION (seat03, 2026-08-29): this row's own SCOPE text quotes the check as
# `grep -c '^## NEXT$'` (ANCHORED -- a heading line may carry nothing after the word NEXT). hq_B's own
# FINDING -- the evidentiary basis for the whole row -- measured with `grep -c '^## NEXT'` (UNANCHORED:
# any heading starting "## NEXT" counts, parenthetical or not), and hq_B's own cured reference example,
# tests-consolidate-icon.task.md, has a CURRENT heading reading `## NEXT (CURRENT -- 2026-08-29T...
# seat02, sixth renumbering)`. The anchored pattern does not match that line at all, so building the LAW
# against it would fail the blessed example on its own gate. Built against hq_B's actual (unanchored)
# pattern instead; the SCOPE text's trailing `$` reads as a transcription slip in ceo's brief, not a
# considered stricter spec -- corrected here rather than silently reconciled, per this project's own
# "provenance dies at the moment of transcription" caution.
#
# ⭐ RATCHET, NOT A HARD ==1 (ceo's own scope note, ledger 2026-08-29b): a live corpus this large has
# legacy non-conformance not caused by whoever runs this gate next; a hard bar on day one blocks every
# seat on somebody else's debt. The ceiling may only fall, driven down by the sweep (this row's scope
# item 3), never raised to accommodate a new offender.
#
# Usage: bash scripts/test_gate_baton_one_next_block.sh [--selftest]
#   (no args)   scans the real postoffice, prints CHECKED/BAD, exits 0 (<=ratchet) or 1 (>ratchet, names
#               every offender) or 2 (cannot enumerate -- queue/tasks dir missing or zero live topics).
#   --selftest  proves the scan function both ways on synthetic fixtures (RULES.md INSTRUMENT LAWS #2:
#               a criterion must be shown able to say both YES and NO before it is trusted), then exits.

# which is MISSING a task file entirely -- a different defect (a queue row with no baton), not a NEXT-block one, and
# not repairable by demoting anything. Held at 1 rather than 0 so that row's absence does not block every seat.
