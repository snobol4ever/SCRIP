# test_gate_pl_an_asserted_atom_survives_a_collection.sh -- AN ATOM STORED IN AN ASSERTED CLAUSE MUST STILL BE

# prolog-an-asserted-clauses-atom-argument-comes-back-empty-or-as-another-atoms-name-after-a-collection).
#
# ⛔⭐ WHAT THIS CATCHES IS A WRONG ANSWER, NOT A CRASH, AND THAT IS WHY IT EXISTS. Measured on SCRIP 385ac1f56:
# assert N clauses whose functor is interned AT RUN TIME and whose argument is a bound atom, then in a SECOND
# pass call them back. call(p_N(X)) SUCCEEDS -- the clause is there -- and X comes back as the EMPTY atom, or
# as p_10, WHICH IS ANOTHER ATOM'S NAME. A stale pointer that still reads plausibly is exactly what a single
# eyeball comparison cannot catch, which is why this grades against the oracle and grades REPEATEDLY.
#
# ⛔ THE REF IS CUT FROM swipl AT RUN TIME, NEVER FROM OUR OWN OUTPUT (CEO-753, and hq_U's standing ask on this
# class). If swipl cannot run, this REFUSES rc=2 -- it never falls back to a ref we minted ourselves.
#
# ⛔ THREE INGREDIENTS ARE ALL REQUIRED and ablating any one of them makes the witness pass, so do not "simplify"
# it: (1) the functor is interned at RUN TIME via atom_concat -- a static functor passes; (2) the argument is a
# bound ATOM -- an integer or an unbound variable passes; (3) assert-all THEN call-all in TWO passes -- interleaving
# assert and call passes. A witness missing any one of these banks a false green.
#
# ⛔ SCRIP_GC_STRESS IS A SANCTIONED CONFIGURATION, NOT A DEBUG TOY: five gates in this tree already grade under it
# (test_gc_stress_suite.sh, test_gate_gc_aggregate_interiors_are_marked_not_only_slotted.sh,
# test_gate_gc_table_insertion_order_array_is_rooted_not_pinned_alive.sh, test_gate_pas_heap_table_is_a_movable_root.sh,
# test_gate_rc8a_gc_coverage.sh). A collector must be correct at EVERY collection point; the knob only makes the
# point deterministic. ⭐ HONEST BOUND, STATED SO NOBODY OVERCLAIMS: this was NOT reproduced without the knob at
# N=200 or N=2000 (no collection occurs), and at N=20000 a DIFFERENT and unrelated limit fires first
# ("zls: vslot table overflow (16384)"), so the no-knob path could not be tested at that scale. This gate therefore
# proves a defect under a sanctioned configuration; it does NOT claim a frequency in ordinary runs.
#
# ⛔⭐ THIS GATE IS DELIBERATELY **NOT WIRED** INTO make test / test-sequential YET, AND THAT IS A DECISION, NOT AN
# OVERSIGHT. It grades an OPEN rank-0 defect (row prolog-an-asserted-clauses-atom-argument-comes-back-empty-or-as-
# another-atoms-name-after-a-collection), so wiring it today would turn the blocking set red for every seat in the
# fleet over a defect nobody is mid-cure on. It is written here so the row has a runnable DONE-WHEN and so the
# next seat can reproduce in one command. ⛔ WIRE IT BLOCKING IN THE LANDING THAT CURES THE DEFECT -- not before,
# not later. This note exists because in this tree a gate that is still `ls`-able reads as a gate that still runs,
# and the only thing that makes an unwired gate honest is the file saying so out loud.
# EXIT: 0 every iteration matched the oracle in every mode graded · 1 a mismatch (the defect) · 2 REFUSED to grade.
