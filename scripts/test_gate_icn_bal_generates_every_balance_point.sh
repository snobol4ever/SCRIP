# test_gate_icn_bal_generates_every_balance_point.sh -- bal() is a generator at every arity and resumes to the next balance point (ceo CEO-645).
#
# MEASURED 2026-09-12 (row icon-bal-generator-yields-one-result-not-a-backtracking-sequence; the adversarial batch a13):
# `every writes(bal('+-', '(', ')', "(a+b)+c-(d)+e"))` printed 6 alone where icont prints 6 8 12 -- bal with two or more
# arguments was lowered as a plain call (one result, no resume) and the by-name generator re-pump knew only find and upto.
# Cure: the lowerer treats bal at every arity (0..6) as a generator, and the by-name branch is a stepping function that
# carries (position, running balance count) in the generator's resume cell -- a restart with count zero would misread a
# c1 character that also opens or closes. Arms: four cset shapes, tab(bal()) inside a scan with a further conjunct (the
# tokenizer idiom the row names), the no-argument scanning form, explicit i and j, and a c1 that overlaps c2, byte-identical
# to icont in both modes. FAIL_ONCE=1 corrupts the captured stream to prove the diff arm trips.
