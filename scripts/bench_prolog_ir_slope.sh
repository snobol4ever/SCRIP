# bench_prolog_ir_slope.sh -- THE TWO-NUMBER WORK/OVERHEAD BASIS FOR PROLOG KERNELS, AS AN Ir REGRESSION.
# Row prolog-has-no-ir-at-fixed-work-instrument-so-every-speed-number-in-the-lane-is-wall-clock-only
# (hq_prolog 2026-09-16, officer cto). Modelled on bench_ir_slope.sh (snobol4, hq_P, ceo audit CEO-192).
#
# ⛔⭐ WHY THIS EXISTS. MODE line 2 states the speed basis for every language HQ and it ends with an
# Ir-AT-FIXED-WORK CLAUSE BESIDE THE WALL-CLOCK BAR, NEVER INSTEAD OF IT. SNOBOL4 could produce that
# clause; PROLOG COULD NOT. Censused 2026-09-16 over all six bench_prolog_*.sh -- callgrind 0, perf stat
# 0, instructions 0 in every one of them (the two mentions in bench_prolog_wrap.sh are prose in its
# header, not invocations). All three Prolog angles -- vanroy, fixed_iter, perf -- are WALL-CLOCK, so on
# a fleet that routinely sits at load 16 to 34 with ten seats running, a Prolog speed number could not be
# taken at all. This board is LOAD-IMMUNE: Ir is deterministic, so it is the one angle that can be run on
# a busy box, and it was developed on one (load 8, 36 competing scrip/swipl/gprolog processes).
#
# ⛔⭐⭐ THE TWO NUMBERS ARE NEVER SUBTRACTED ACROSS, AND ON PROLOG THAT IS NOT BOOKKEEPING -- IT INVERTS
# THE ANSWER. Measured on nrev at the development of this script: SCRIP m4 WORK 4,543,131 Ir/iteration
# with OVERHEAD 3,474,531 Ir; gprolog WORK 224,837 with OVERHEAD 27,112,888; swipl WORK 230,875 with
# OVERHEAD 53,695,164. On WORK, SCRIP does 20.21x the work of gprolog per iteration. On OVERHEAD it is
# 7.80x CHEAPER. A single-shot whole-program number at a small n is dominated by the oracles' 27M-to-54M
# startup and SHOWS SCRIP WINNING. So any Prolog speed claim taken as one number at one n is reporting
# the ratio of the startups, and the sign of the answer depends on n.
#
# ⛔ WHAT THIS DOES NOT MEASURE, AND THE CLAUSE SITS BESIDE THE WALL CLOCK FOR THIS REASON. Ir counts
# instructions retired, not cycles: no cache misses, no branch mispredicts, no memory stalls. It is NOT a
# wall-clock predictor. corpus/benchmarks/prolog/bench/nrev.pl's own header records an honest
# engine-vs-engine WALL-CLOCK ratio of 6.68x against GNU where this board reads 20.21x on Ir -- both are
# right, and together they say SCRIP retires roughly 3x more instructions per unit time than gprolog on
# that kernel, which is what flat-wired straight-line x86 against a bytecode dispatch loop should look
# like. A reader who takes the WORK column as a time ratio will claim a 20x deficit that is not there.
#
# THE ADEQUACY CHECK IS BUILT IN. Two independent slopes are computed, from (N,2N) and from (2N,4N). In
# the linear regime they agree; if N is too small to have left the setup transient, or the kernel's
# per-iteration cost grows, they diverge and the row prints NONLINEAR rather than a number. ⭐ TWO POINTS
# ALWAYS FIT A LINE -- the third point is what makes this a measurement of the model rather than an
# assumption of it. Measured during development: SCRIP's pairwise slopes on nrev across n=20/40/60 read
# 4543131, 4543132, 4543133, and swipl's 230875, 230877, 230878, residual 0.000 percent.
#
# ⛔ N IS CALIBRATED PER KERNEL, NEVER FIXED. These kernels differ by orders of magnitude per iteration,
# so one N either starves a cheap kernel out of its linear regime or buries an expensive one under
# callgrind's ~50x slowdown. Each kernel is probed cheaply, then N is chosen to hit a fixed INSTRUCTION
# budget -- the thing that actually bounds both the runtime and the noise.
#
# EXIT: 0 = board printed, 1 = a kernel read UNPROVEN/NONLINEAR, 2 = REFUSED (could not measure).
