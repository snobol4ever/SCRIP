# test_icn_n2_host_reserved_agrees.sh -- N-2 item 3: THE HOST-RESERVED AGREEMENT invariant (hq_P 2026-08-28).
#
# THE CLAIM UNDER TEST:  icn_gen_host_reserve_offset() answers (off>=0, base>=0) for exactly the host kinds
# icn_gen_host_reserved() says reserve, and REFUSES (-1/-1) for the rest.  icn_gen_host_reserve() is called from
# BOTH non-zframe arms of the three-arm prologue chain -- if (zframe_graph) :2829 (never reserves) / else if
# (icn_genframe2() && flat_gen) :2832 (icon-n2-flat-gen-host-transitive-reserve) / else if (flat_lcl_proc) :2845
# (step 2b) -- so a graph taking the FIRST arm reserves nothing; the other two both do.
#
# ⛔ WHY THIS IS A GATE.  Before the s282 cure the scan was HOST-KIND-BLIND and returned a plausible `off=0 base=128`
# for a flat_gen host that had never carved anything: MEASURED on suspend_nested's inner(), and on a two-caller
# witness the SAME generator answered `off=0 base=128` from its flat_gen host and `off=128 base=240` from its
# flat_lcl_proc host. Zero is the most dangerous answer available -- indistinguishable from a correct first-slot
# answer -- so a step-3 consumer would carve into a region that was never reserved and corrupt the host frame three
# layers from the edit.
# ⛔ AND THE PREDICATE MIRRORS AN else-if CHAIN IN ANOTHER TRANSLATION UNIT WITH NO COMPILER CHECK THAT IT STILL DOES.
# That is precisely what rots silently: add a fourth arm, or move either reserve call, and the predicate is wrong
# with nothing to say so. This gate is that missing check.
#
# ⛔ CONTRACT HISTORY.
#   1. hq_P s282: BOTH host kinds ANSWER (the original, unconditional shape, before the region-resident redesign).
#   2. ceo s283, 2026-08-29: 06d4852f's flat_gen-arm stack reserve is superseded by the region-resident alpha (a
#      flat_gen host carves nothing on the stack under that design, so answering would hand out a base into storage
#      that does not exist) -- contract NARROWED to flat_lcl_proc-only-answers, flat_gen REFUSES, until the
#      transitive reserve lands.
#   3. seat06, 2026-08-29, row icon-n2-flat-gen-host-transitive-reserve: contract RESTORED to BOTH-KINDS-ANSWER --
#      icn_gen_host_reserve() is now recursive (reserve(g) = SUM(align16(ft_callee)+48+reserve(callee))) and a
#      flat_gen host's region IS big enough for its own generator callees, carved by ITS OWN caller under the SAME
#      recursive formula. base is now HOST-KIND-AWARE (icn_gen_host_reserve_offset): RSP-relative for flat_lcl_proc
#      (unchanged), RBP-relative (rbp=H, constant 48 past the host's own header, no pad/L7 depth tracking) for
#      flat_gen. This is state 1's contract again, reached by a different, load-bearing mechanism, not a reversion.
# THREE STATES:  rc=0 invariant holds  |  rc=1 violated  |  rc=2 could not measure (never skip-as-success)
