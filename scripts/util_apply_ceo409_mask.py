"""util_apply_ceo409_mask.py -- apply the CEO-409 line masks of ONE suite entry to a stream on stdin.

⛔⭐ THIS IS A SHIM OVER corpus_suite_harness.py, NEVER A SECOND IMPLEMENTATION.  It imports that file's own
read_mask_sidecar() and apply_line_mask(), so a bash runner and the python harness mask the SAME lines by the
SAME rules: the same sidecar path derivation (<stem>.mask beside <stem>.ref), the same REGEX DIALECT (python's,
not awk's ERE -- a mask written once must not mean two different things depending on which runner reads it), and
the same replace-never-delete marker.  ⭐ THE DIALECT IS THE WHOLE REASON THIS IS A SHIM: `\\d`, `(?i)` and lazy
quantifiers are all silently different or absent in an ERE, so a re-implementation would agree on every mask
anyone happened to test and diverge on the first one they did not.

Usage:  util_apply_ceo409_mask.py <ref-path> <entry-name> <count-out-path>  < stream > masked-stream
Writes the masked stream to stdout and the masked-line COUNT to <count-out-path> (guardrail 3: an invisible mask
is the hiding mechanism, a counted one is a measurement).  REFUSES rc=2 on a malformed sidecar, which is
read_mask_sidecar()'s own refusal -- not a copy of its policy.
