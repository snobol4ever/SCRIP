# test_gate_no_master_ref_is_an_ast_dump.sh -- NO MASTER REF IS AN AST DUMP. Every entry of every master is graded by RUNNING it in
# both modes (Lon 2026-09-23, CEO-1218/1230: "Get rid of those m3 and and m4 specific columns. We do not do that here."), so a ref
# that is a `--dump-ast` dump can only ever manufacture a red that means nothing: the entry's program output is diffed against a
# parse tree. This gate is the survivor of test_gate_ast_shaped_refs_are_declared_ast.sh (hq_T 2026-09-05), whose converse arm
# asked that such a ref be DECLARED modes=ast; with the declaration gone, the only correct count of dump-shaped refs is zero.
# ⛔ THE STRICT (ACCUSING) PREDICATE, kept from its predecessor: a ref opens with '(' AND carries a marker ordinary program output
# does not ((STMT, (PROGRAM, :subj, :lhs), so a program that merely prints a parenthesised first line is never accused.
# ⛔ AN UNREADABLE MASTER IS A REFUSAL rc=2, NEVER A CLEAN LANGUAGE; zero masters read is a refusal too.
# EXIT: 0 no dump-shaped ref in any master · 1 at least one, each named · 2 could not measure.
