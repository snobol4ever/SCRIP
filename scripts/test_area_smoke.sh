#   AREA_SMOKE_ROOT=<dir>                  the checkout to diff (default this script's SCRIP/); the map is read from THAT root's

# ⛔ THE SEAT MUST NOT HAVE TO KNOW (Lon's sixth question): the map answers, not memory. A touched src/ file with no row in the
# map REFUSES rc=2 naming it -- the lander adds the row with the landing. A tree equal to the base prints NO-DIFF and exits 0.
# A landing that touches only carriers mapped to `-` (no area) prints NO-AREA and exits 0. Files outside src/ (scripts, corpus,
# docs) carry no area and are printed as such: the gates a diff touched are the other half of the per-landing verdict.
# ⛔ NOT A BOARD: corpus_suite_harness.py smoke appends no progress row and writes no score cell (CEO-547); no one-runner guard
# is sourced here because none applies. EXIT: 0 every selected entry PASS in both modes (or nothing to smoke, said loudly);
# 1 a red entry; 2 could not measure (unmapped carrier, unknown feature, zero population, stale binary).
