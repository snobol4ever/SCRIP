# test_gate_pl_a_quoted_atom_doubles_its_apostrophe.sh -- INSIDE A QUOTED TOKEN THE APOSTROPHE DOUBLES (ISO
# 6.4.2.1), in every writer and in BOTH MODES (row prolog-logtalk-write-term-print-and-write-canonical-family,
# hq_R 2026-09-13, on the coo's master-board diagnosis of entry format_directive_6).
#
# THE DEFECT THIS PINS. plc_wt_atom escaped the apostrophe as \' -- the swipl spelling. gprolog, SICStus and the
# Prolog master's OWN REF all double it: the ref reads  it's|'it''s'  and we printed  it's|'it\'s'. One character,
# one site, and it reached writeq/1, print/1, write_canonical/1, write_term/2,3 and format ~q at once, because all
# five go through that one function.
#
# ⛔⭐ WHY IT SURVIVED FOR MONTHS, WHICH IS THE PART WORTH KEEPING. BOTH SPELLINGS READ BACK AS ONE APOSTROPHE, so
# the one property anyone thinks to test of a quoted writer -- that writeq's output reads back equal, the round trip
# -- IS EXACTLY THE PROPERTY THIS DEFECT PRESERVES. It cannot be caught by a self-consistency test of any kind; only
# a ref diff or an oracle diff can see it. ⭐ The general form: when a defect is invisible to the strongest test a
# module can run ON ITSELF, the missing arm is never a better self-test -- it is an external witness. So this gate
# pins the BYTES against the oracle's spelling, and keeps the round trip only as the arm proving the cure did not
# trade readability for the ref (both must hold; either alone is satisfiable by a wrong writer).
#
# ⛔ AND THE NEIGHBOURS ARE GRADED, because a one-character switch in a switch statement is exactly the shape that
# takes a sibling case with it: \\ must still be a backslash pair, \n \t must still be the control escapes, an
# unquoted write/1 must still print the bare text, and a quote-only atom '''' must still come out as four quotes.
# rc 0 green · 1 red · 2 could not measure.
