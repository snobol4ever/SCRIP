"""util_gc_differential.py -- THE DIFFERENTIAL GC ORACLE: one program, N GC configurations, no .ref at all.

Row gc-the-differential-oracle-same-program-under-two-gc-configurations-must-agree (coo, 2026-09-21, MODE TENET).
From GCFuzz (differential testing across GC options) and CrossLangFuzzer.

THE PRINCIPLE. Garbage collection is SEMANTICALLY INVISIBLE. The same program on the same input must produce
byte-identical output under EVERY GC configuration. A divergence IS a defect, by definition, with NO oracle
required -- which turns every program in the corpus into a GC test in all seven languages without anyone
writing a witness.

⛔⭐ AND THE WHOLE DESIGN TURNS ON ONE HAZARD THAT WAS MEASURED BEFORE A LINE OF THIS FILE WAS WRITTEN.
A differential's pass condition is AGREEMENT, so a configuration that silently does not take produces a
PASS over a population of one. Measured on hb_bignum_length.icn, origin f7669a6a8, SCRIP_ZETA_TELEM=1:

    shipped                collections=0        SCRIP_GC_RELOC=1       collections=0
    SCRIP_GC_POISON=0      collections=0        SCRIP_GC_PLANT_SHIFT=65536  collections=0
    SCRIP_HEAP_MB=1        collections=1        SCRIP_GC_STRESS=3      collections=2598

FOUR OF SIX DECLARED CONFIGURATIONS COLLECT ZERO TIMES AND HAVE BYTE-IDENTICAL (EMPTY) EVENT FINGERPRINTS.
RELOC, POISON and PLANT_SHIFT are MODIFIERS OF A COLLECTION, not independent axes: with nothing forcing a
collection at the shipped arena they collapse onto the baseline exactly, and a six-row md5 table over them
reads "six configurations agree" while measuring one. The cto measured the same class from the other side the
same afternoon (SCRIP_GC_PLANT_SHIFT=1048576 applying ZERO times, rc=0, byte-identical stdout; cured at SCRIP
1b317bea3 so a declined plant now names itself). THEREFORE EVERY CONFIGURATION IS COMPOSED WITH A COLLECTING
AXIS, AND NO CONFIGURATION IS ACCEPTED ON ITS DECLARATION: each must be PROVEN DISTINCT in the collector's own
printed events before its output is compared, and one that cannot be is UNDISTINGUISHED (rc=2), never a pass.

⛔ THE DISTINCTNESS VERDICT IS A PROPERTY OF THE FINGERPRINT'S VOCABULARY, which is the second trap and it
bit the first draft. SCRIP_HEAP_MB=1 SCRIP_GC_POISON=0 has a move fingerprint IDENTICAL to SCRIP_HEAP_MB=1 --
poison changes what is written to VACATED ground, not what moves -- so a fingerprint built from the move
columns alone calls a genuinely distinct configuration undistinguished and throws away a real axis. The
fingerprint is therefore taken over EVERY collector line tag: [ZGC-POISON] is absent under POISON=0 and
present under the default, and that absence is the distinction. A fingerprint too narrow discards real
configurations; too wide (addresses, timings) makes every run of ONE configuration look distinct and the
determinism pre-pass collapses. Both directions are gate arms.

⛔ A DIVERGENCE IS NEVER REPORTED ON ONE READING. When two configurations disagree, BOTH are re-run and each
must prove SELF-STABLE before the divergence is reported; a side that differs from itself makes the program
EXCLUDED-NONDETERMINISTIC instead. So the common case costs one extra run (the reference config, twice) and
rigour is spent exactly where a defect is claimed.

⛔ WHY rc=2 AND NOT rc=1 ON A DIVERGENCE. The question this harness answers for a caller is "what is this
program's output?" If two GC configurations disagree there IS NO SINGLE OUTPUT, so the harness genuinely
CANNOT MEASURE and must refuse rather than hand a board one of the two answers. A caller that grades against
a .ref would otherwise pick whichever configuration it happened to run. The DEFECT is reported by name in the
text and by the gate's ratchet; the rc reports measurability, per RULES.md THE INSTRUMENT LAWS.

⛔ THE POPULATION EXCLUDES A PROGRAM THAT READS THE GC CONFIGURATION, because such a program diverges
legitimately and is not evidence about the collector. Measured 2026-09-21: no program in corpus/tests or
scripts/gc_witnesses calls getenv on a SCRIP_GC_*/SCRIP_HEAP_MB name (three witnesses MENTION a knob in a
comment, which is not a read). The check is kept because the day one appears it must be named, not graded.

⛔ SPELLING IS HELD CONSTANT AND THAT IS LOAD-BEARING (COO-127): the source path is itself a heap block, so
its length shifts every block after it, and one witness reaches interior=1 as scripts/x and interior=0 as
./scripts/x. Every configuration of one program is therefore invoked with the IDENTICAL path string; the
differential is immune to that variable only because it never varies it, and it is stamped on the report line.

VERDICTS, one per program, and the identity is printed:
    AGREE                        >=2 distinct configurations, byte-identical stdout and rc. The only pass.
    DIVERGE                      >=2 distinct configurations, outputs differ. Both sides proven self-stable.
    NO-COLLECTION                no configuration collected -- the program carries NO GC evidence at all.
    UNDISTINGUISHED              collections happened but <2 distinct fingerprints -- nothing to compare.
    EXCLUDED-NONDETERMINISTIC    differs from ITSELF under one configuration. Named, never silently dropped.
    EXCLUDED-READS-GC-CONFIG     reads a GC knob, so it diverges by its own design.
    UNMEASURED                   a configuration timed out or could not run; the reason is named.
    AGREE + DIVERGE + NO-COLLECTION + UNDISTINGUISHED + EXCLUDED-* + UNMEASURED == population

    normalized fingerprints, 16 and 8, differing in exactly one field -- slots=600 vs slots=601 (g_gc_nslot,
