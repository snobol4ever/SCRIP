# test_gate_raku_an_exception_is_a_value_that_die_carries_and_catch_and_throws_like_read.sh -- AN EXCEPTION IS A TYPED VALUE: die CARRIES IT, $! HOLDS IT, CATCH CATCHES IN ANY BLOCK, throws-like READS IT
# (row raku-every-suite-to-100-under-nonet-ceo-1266, Lon 2026-09-25: "use IPC sync-step monitor to crawl the test suites to 100%"; the Roast compile census after the Match landing: `$!` 20 first-refusals, and throws-like in 54 of 240 sampled compiled files).
#
# THE DEFECT: an exception was only a message string in one fixed C buffer (g_script_exception). `$!` was refused by the compile guard; X::AdHoc.new(payload=>..) was rewritten by the parser to its bare payload string
# and `when X::AdHoc` to a default arm; a die with an object lost the object; CATCH worked only directly inside `try` (a CATCH in a bare block or a sub body was ignored and the die killed the program); `try` as an
# expression yielded "" instead of its body's value (`my $r = try { 5 }`; `try { die } // "d"` stopped the program); a `return` inside a try body leaked the try depth so every later die was swallowed;
# and throws-like was "PARSED BUT NOT IMPLEMENTED" -- a red on every file that used it, whatever else it did right.
# THE CURE (by_name_dispatch.c, lower_raku.c, rk_tree.c): an exception is a DATA instance of a class that isa Exception -- the builtin X::AdHoc(payload), the runtime-error classes (X::Numeric::DivideByZero,
# X::Multi::NoMatch, X::TypeCheck::Binding/Assignment, X::OutOfRange, ...; a message table classifies what C raises) and any user `class E is Exception`. `die`/.throw store the object in the Raku global "!" (the
# rooted named-variable table: no new C global) and raise its message; try_enter clears "!", the catch path (exc_get, exc_clear) fills it from the pending message when a C-raised error did not; `$!` is the provider
# __rk_pre("!"); `$_` in CATCH is the object (.message, .WHAT, ~~ Type, "$_" all work). A CATCH in any block or sub body wraps the block in the same try with a default arm that rethrows (`__rk_rethrow`) when no
# `when` matched, as Rakudo does; `try` yields its body's last value (Nil on failure); a return inside a try exits the try depth it sits in (rcx_t.try_depth); throws-like { } , Type, [desc], key => matcher...
# is desugared by the tree builder like lives-ok/dies-ok into try + __rk_test_throws_like($!, Type, ...) which checks the class (isa, through the MRO) and each key as a smartmatch of the exception's method.
# NOT HERE (own rows): EVAL of a string (throws-like 'code' and eval-lives-ok need a runtime compile), Failure objects (Rakudo returns a Failure from 5/0 and throws on sink), the exception backtrace,
# .resume, the runtime errors the table does not classify (they are X::AdHoc), and CATCH's `.rethrow` of a modified exception.
#
# THE WITNESSES, each graded in m3 (--run) and m4 (--compile + link) against a ref cut by Rakudo (/usr/bin/raku): exc (the value, $!, try, CATCH in blocks and subs, rethrow, nesting, return inside the
# wrapped sub) exact; tl (throws-like pass/fail verdicts over class, message regex/string, user attribute, no-throw, wrong class/message/attribute) compared on its `ok`/`not ok` lines. Then the same two under
# SCRIP_GC_STRESS 1 3 5, both modes.
# FAILED ONCE, measured on SCRIP 889e90550 before the cure: 16 of 16 witness-mode pairs red (exc refused at the compile guard on the bang variable in both modes and empty in m3; tl reds every throws-like line).
#
# EXIT: 0 every witness matches in both modes; 1 a mismatch or a crash on a witness; 2 REFUSED (stale binary, no gcc).
