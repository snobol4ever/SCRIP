# util_regen_jcon_generated_sources.sh -- regenerate JCON's two GENERATED modules, do_ops.icn and interface.icn.
#
# ⛔ THIS IS NOT PART OF THE HANDOFF SEQUENCE. RULES.md § Handoff sequence names exactly THREE regen
# scripts and this is not one of them. Run it only when the JCON package's generator sources
# (oplexgen.icn / interfacegen.icn) change upstream -- which is approximately never.
#
# WHY THE TWO FILES EXIST AT ALL. JCON's tran/Makefile builds `jtran` from SEVENTEEN modules, two of
# which are programs' output, not hand-written source:
#     do_ops.icn:    oplexgen     ;  ./oplexgen > do_ops.icn
#     interface.icn: interfacegen ;  ./interfacegen > interface.icn
# ⭐ The corpus carried the 16 hand-written modules and BOTH GENERATORS, but neither generated file
# (measured 2026-09-03, hq_B). The consequence was quiet and expensive: a `jtran` linked from the 15
# modules the package README listed builds and runs, so nothing looked wrong -- but `lexer.icn` calls
# into do_ops at its very first token, so every pipeline past `preproc` died at lexer.icn:14 with
# "procedure or integer expected, offending value: &null". The missing file presented as a lexer bug.
#
# ⛔ THE ORACLE GENERATES, SCRIP DOES NOT -- ON PURPOSE. These two files are INPUTS to the demo that
# grades SCRIP. Generating them with SCRIP would let a SCRIP defect author its own oracle input, and
# the JCON demo would then be grading SCRIP against itself. (It is also not hypothetical: SCRIP's own
# oplexgen emits the same 611 lines in a different key(table) order -- see corpus/demos/icon/jcon/
# oplexgen.knowndiff. Regenerating with SCRIP would silently re-order do_ops.icn.)
#
# ⭐ SEMICOLONS: SCRIP's Icon front end requires explicit `;` and does zero newline processing, while
# the generators emit newline-style Icon. So each generated file goes through the shared
# tools/semicolonize_icon.py -- the same one-time transform the rest of the package had applied -- and
# this script VERIFIES the transform added semicolons and nothing else, by stripping trailing `;` back
# off and requiring a byte-exact match against the generator's own output.
#
# EXIT: 0 = both files regenerated and verified.  2 = REFUSED (oracle missing, generator failed,
#       semicolonizer missing, or the strip-back verification failed -- never a silent half-write).
# USAGE: bash scripts/util_regen_jcon_generated_sources.sh [--check]     (--check: verify, do not write)
