# test_gate_gc_nv_cell_caches_honour_the_memo_generation.sh -- a cached interior pointer into an NV_t block is wrong
# after every collection, and the cache that holds one must join the invalidation protocol the collector already calls
# (cfo CFO-116, 2026-09-20, SCRIP 621c08866).
#
# MEASURED: `user_function_eval_arbno_replace_branch_2` of the snobol4 master, extracted through the harness's OWN
# extract and run with SNO_LIB and the cwd the grader uses, died rc=139 at SCRIP_GC_STRESS=21 and 35 under a 1 MB arena,
# 3 of 3, stable partial md5 ae252bdf. core_gc_roots (core/core.c) followed _var_buckets[192] into a block whose header
# read size=32 type=2 -- DT_S, a STRING -- because rt_dcap_pump's `*cell = d` (pattern_match.c) wrote 16 bytes through a
# DESCR_t* cached before gc_collect_ex slid the heap, landing on the `next` field of the live NV_t named "thy". A
# hardware watchpoint on that field named the writer; the collector's own [GC-SHIFT] banner states the law it broke.
# The protocol already existed and the collector already called it (rt_nv_memo_invalidate, gc_heap.c, six lines after
# the slide) and _var_find_cached already joined it; g_dcap_nv_cell never did. Cure: g_dcap_nv_seen[] compared against
# g_nv_memo_gen at BOTH read sites. Origin vs cured over a 10-point band, 3 of 3: byte-identical at stress
# 0/1/2/3/5/8/13/55, and rc=139 -> rc=0 at 21 and 35.
#
# ⛔⭐ ARM 1 IS GRADED WITH SCRIP_GC_TRAP=0 SINCE 2026-09-21, AND THE KNOB IS DECLARED HERE RATHER THAN HIDDEN.
# The stale-read trap (cfo, rung 1 of ARCH-GC § 9) turns a read of vacated ground into a SIGSEGV at the instruction
# that used the stale pointer. This entry has TWO defects -- the cached DESCR_t* write this gate cured, and the
# a84e1945 wrong answer that is hq_snobol4's row -- and the trap makes the SECOND one die of signal 11 at stress 21
# and 35, measured 3 of 3. An rc-only arm cannot tell that from the first defect coming back, so the GRADED runs use
# the pre-trap configuration where the criterion is exact, and one REPORTED trap-on run per stress point names what
# the trap sees. ⛔ A SIGNAL DEATH UNDER THE TRAP WITH NO [ZGC-STALE] REPORT IS STILL THIS GATE'S RED: the trap must
# CLAIM the death or the death is unexplained, and an unexplained death is the thing this gate exists to catch.
#
# ⛔ THIS GATE GRADES rc ONLY, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE. The entry still prints a WRONG ANSWER under collection
# (a84e1945 at most of the band, present identically on origin) -- a second, independent defect that is hq_snobol4's row.
# Grading stdout here would red on someone else's open defect and make this arm unreadable. A crash is the thing cured
# and a crash is the thing measured.
#
# Arms: (1) BEHAVIOUR -- the witness must not die of a signal at the two stress levels that crashed on origin;
#       (2) STRUCTURE -- every read of g_dcap_nv_key[] that compares a key must also compare g_dcap_nv_seen[], so a
#           future edit cannot generation-check one read site and miss its sibling (the CFO-111 shape: a census
#           complete for the spelling it grepped and not for the thing it named).
# FAIL_ONCE=1 drops the generation check from the structure arm's view to prove arm 2 trips.
