# SHIPPED PROGRAMS THAT SPITBOL REJECTS, WITH THE CSNOBOL4 FEATURE NAMED, AND THE SUITE ROW CARRIES THE COUNT (ceo CEO-1286).
#
# LON 2026-09-26, in-chat to the ceo, verbatim: "The task is to identify which of the test programs found in the original package
# are in the SPITBOL dialect. We want to exclude from the denominator all that are not SPITBOL dialect. We want to show this number
# of EXCLUDED tests in the test-suite grid." -- and the test: "So the way to tell if a program is SPITBOL dialect is two-fold, 1st
# is rejected by SPITBOL, and 2nd why it is rejected is a CSNOBOL4 feature not supported. Then if these two are true it is NOT
# SPITBOL dialect."
#
# ARMS, per package under corpus/packages/snobol4 (aisnobol csnobol4_suite dotnet gimpel snoflake_suite spitbol_testpgms
# spitbol_x64_tests -- a package with no EXCLUDED.tsv is RED: EXCLUDED=0 is a ruling written down, never an absence):
#   (a) every row is name<TAB>NOT_SPITBOL_DIALECT<TAB>evidence, the evidence 60+ chars naming CSNOBOL4 and sbl -bf
#   (b) every name ships (the file exists) and is not a CONTAINERS.tsv row (a container is already out of shipped)
#   (c) HALF ONE OF THE TEST, MEASURED: every name (or its <name>_driver, gimpel) is in OUTSIDE_SPITBOL_BASELINE.tsv -- the record of
#       what sbl -bf refuses; a program the oracle runs cannot be excluded whatever feature it uses
#   (d) no name twice
#   (e) SPITBOL's own test deck is never excluded (spitbol_testpgms/*.spt, csnobol4_suite/diag1.sno, diag2.sno -- Lon 2026-09-26:
#       "Get ALL 8 working in SCRIP since they are SPITBOL programs.")
# and, over .github/SUITES.tsv:
#   (f) each package's row carries today_excluded, and it classifies EVERY shipped unit the denominator leaves out (Lon 2026-09-26,
#       "use the Excl column to properly classify the exclusions for good reasons only"; CEO-1288): no fewer than the package's
#       CONTAINERS.tsv include fragments (a container is never in a denominator, so an Excl below them hides one -- Jcon read 86/86
#       with an empty Excl over five), and no more than those plus the EXCLUDED.tsv rows. csnobol4_suite's fragments are outside its
#       graded-pair population and named in its row text, not Excl (CEO-1288), so its bound is EXCLUDED.tsv alone. Arm (f) also reads
#       every other language's package that ships a CONTAINERS.tsv (Icon's arizona_tests, jcon_tests and ipl).
# FAIL_ONCE=1 plants a dotnet row naming a shipped program the oracle RUNS (chap8_funcs.sno), so arm (c) trips.
# FAIL_ONCE=f reads a copy of SUITES.tsv with jcon's today_excluded blanked and dotnet's at 99, so arm (f) trips on both bounds.
# rc 0 = every arm holds; rc 1 = a FAIL named; rc 2 = REFUSED-TO-GRADE (no packages tree, no SUITES.tsv).
