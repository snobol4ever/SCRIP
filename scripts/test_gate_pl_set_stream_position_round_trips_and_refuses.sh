# test_gate_pl_set_stream_position_round_trips_and_refuses.sh -- set_stream_position/2 must REPOSITION a
# stream to a position stream_property/2 handed out, and must raise each of its four ISO sec 8.11.9 errors
# rather than failing silently (row prolog-logtalk-eleven-unicode-stream-cases-routed-from-the-builtins-
# family-row, hq_R 2026-09-13).
#
# WHAT WAS WRONG. set_stream_position/2 was NAMED in src/lower/pl_control_names.h and lowered by nothing, so
# every call threw existence_error(procedure, set_stream_position/2) -- and there was no position/1 stream
# property to obtain a position from in the first place, so the predicate could not have been called
# correctly even once. Both halves were missing and each hid the other: a seat probing the property saw it
# fail and a seat probing the predicate saw it not exist, and neither reads as "this feature is absent".
#
# ⛔⭐ THE POSITION TERM IS DELIBERATELY OPAQUE AND THAT IS THE STANDARD'S OWN CHOICE. ISO/IEC 13211-1
# 7.10.2.13 makes a stream position an IMPLEMENTATION-DEFINED term, and 8.11.9 requires only that
# set_stream_position/2 accept one previously obtained from the same stream. So this gate grades the
# ROUND TRIP -- read a term, read past it, reposition, read the SAME term again -- and never the shape of
# the term. Measured before choosing: every use of a position in this repo's vendored Prolog suites is
# opaque (obtain it, hand it back); NOTHING inspects its arguments. A gate that pinned the arity would be
# pinning a decision the standard explicitly leaves open.
#
# ⛔ THE FOUR ERROR ARMS ARE WHY THIS IS NOT A ONE-ARM GATE. The cheapest cure that passes the round-trip
# arm is an fseek with no argument checking, and it turns every one of these four into a silent success or
# a silent failure. reposition(false) is the one worth naming: a stream that WAS given a position property
# and then refuses to be repositioned looks like a broken fseek unless the permission_error is explicit.
# rc 0 green · 1 red · 2 could not measure.
