#
# WHAT WAS THERE. !f (rt_runtime.c, the DT_FH arm of the element generator) read each line with fgets() into a 4096-byte
# stack buffer and measured it with strlen(), so a line longer than 4095 bytes came back as TWO elements (a 5000-byte line
# generated 4095 and 905) and a line carrying a NUL came back cut at it -- while read(f) over the same file returned both
# whole. Arizona iconx generates every line whole.
#
# WHAT IS HERE. !f reads with rt_line_read, the runtime's one growing line reader (read() already used it), and carries
# the byte count it returns as the element's length.
#
# ARM. Graded against the LIVE oracle (icont/iconx 9.5.25a) in both media: a file of a 5000-byte line, a short line, a
# 9000-byte line and a line with an embedded NUL, read once by !f and once by read(); the lengths printed must match
# iconx's byte for byte. A witness the oracle does not run refuses the gate rather than passing it.
