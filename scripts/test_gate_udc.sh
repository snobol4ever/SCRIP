# CN-4 GATE -- &USER_DECLARED_CONSTANTS (GOAL-SNOBOL4-100).
# Proves the declaration keyword in BOTH MEDIA (m3 --run BINARY, m4 --compile+gcc TEXT) and BOTH KW killswitch arms.
# ORACLE NOTE: every witness here is ORACLE_FAIL BY CONSTRUCTION -- stock SPITBOL answers error 251 for
# &USER_DECLARED_CONSTANTS exactly as for any undefined &name (measured s148), so refs are SCRIP-pinned, never sbl-diffed.
# g-cn2 (s153): the EVAL/CODE BOUNDARY is gated here too. cn_t1_eval sweeps BOTH T1 arms in BOTH media because the
# defect it guards was arm- AND mode-asymmetric: a runtime fragment inherited the main compile's seal table, so m3 with
# T1 on folded &N against a foreign tree_t and printed EMPTY while m4 -- compiling its fragments in another process --
# printed the value. All four cells must agree, and they must agree with the SEALED CELL, never with the fold.
# WITNESS-AUTHORING TRAP (measured s148): do NOT capture 2>&1 on a witness that both prints and errors -- m4 buffers
# stdout to exit while m3 does not, so the INTERLEAVING differs while both streams are byte-identical. Error witnesses
# therefore carry the .err_sno extension (repo convention) and no .ref, and are checked stream-by-stream below.

# ⭐ seat16 2026-08-27: 10 of the 11 witnesses below moved into the shared suite file
# tests/snobol4/probe/cn.sno/.ref (probe-consolidate-m1-and-small) and are read back out one at a time via
# corpus_suite_harness.py's `extract` subcommand -- this gate is now JUST ANOTHER CONSUMER of that shared
# file, not a second copy of the witness text. `cn_udc_closed` (.err_sno, no .ref, stream-separated
# checking) does NOT fit the suite's one-.ref-per-entry model and stays a loose file permanently -- see
# probe/cn/KEEP.md. Byte-equal-or-no-delete already proved each moved witness's suite form matches its
# original under the DEFAULT arm at conversion time; cn_t1_eval/cn_t2_eval_boundary/cn_t1_scalar_fold were
# ADDITIONALLY hand-verified (both T1 arms, both media, extracted form vs the pre-move original) before
# their loose files were deleted, since the harness's own convert step only ever exercises one arm.

# s153 pinned it deliberately ("so KW-5 moves it deliberately rather than silently") and Lon's s168 oracle directive moved it: live sbl FAILS the EVAL and runs on, in total silence.  The three
