# util_autobug.sh — ⭐ THE AUTOMATIC BUG FINDER (Lon's design, 2026-08-20 s182, in-chat).
#
#   bash scripts/util_autobug.sh <file.sno> [stdin-file]
#
# LON'S TECHNIQUE, VERBATIM IN SUBSTANCE: "2-way monitor reports event of FIRST DIVERGENCE.  The previous event
# then is event of the LAST AGREEMENT.  The BUG is between [them] ... INSTRUMENT the BB at that LAST AGREEMENT BB
# to fire TRACE ON ... and TRACE OFF when it arrives at the FIRST DIVERGENCE BB.  This trace has the BUG in it and
# should be REASONABLY LIMITED in size.  An AUTOMATIC BUG FINDER!!!"
#
# ⭐ THE BRACKET NEEDS NO COUNTER AND NO NEW RUNTIME STATE.  The IPC monitor already closes the window on BOTH
# sides by construction: it sync-steps the two engines and KILLS the scrip child the instant the controller
# answers 'S' (the ack arm in mon_send_bin, runtime/core/core.c) — that is, AT THE FIRST DIVERGENCE.  So the
# process dies inside the bug's own statement, the SCRIP_ZSM atexit reporter runs, and the ZSM four-port ring
# (last ZSM_TRACE=64 ports, execution order, runtime_init.c) IS the bounded trace, ending at the divergence.
# TRACE-ON is "64 ports ago" instead of a counter, which is strictly cheaper and needs no instrumentation pass.
# If 64 ports is too short a window for a given bug, widen ZSM_TRACE — that is the ONE knob.
#
# ⛔ MONITOR-SAFETY (RULES.md): a MONITOR_BIN verdict is a verdict on a DIFFERENT program (GVA forced off,
# optimizer arms diverge).  This tool LOCATES; it never GRADES.  Confirm every bracket it hands you against a
# plain build before believing it, and mint a standalone witness from the bracket rather than citing the trace.
