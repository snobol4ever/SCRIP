# test_gate_make_test_loops_and_reports.sh -- `make test` RUNS EVERY ARM AND REPORTS, ruled CEO-582.
#
# THE DEFECT, MEASURED BY THE cfo BEFORE THE CURE: `make test` was ONE target of ~150 recipe lines and make
# ABORTS ON THE FIRST FAILING LINE, so a red at arm 15 killed the set 24s in and 131 ARMS NEVER EXECUTED --
# for all 13 seats, for as long as that arm stayed red.  Not red, not green: UNMEASURED.  The first
# loop-and-continue census found EIGHT non-green where the target reported ONE (five reds, three refusals,
# one of which would have passed vacuously).  WE REPORTED 1 OF 8.
#
# ⛔ WHY THE ARMS BELOW ARE BEHAVIOURAL AND HERMETIC, NOT GREPS.  hq_V's measured lesson, 2026-09-11
# (FINDING-2026-09-11-hq_V-a-source-level-assertion-is-not-a-measurement-of-behaviour.md): a gate of theirs
# grepped for a correctly-spelled form, the form WAS correctly spelled, and the caller one frame up defeated
# it -- green all day over a broken path.  So this gate does not read the driver's source to decide whether
# it loops; it BUILDS A SCRATCH MAKEFILE WITH A RED IN THE MIDDLE AND RUNS `make test` THROUGH IT, then
# counts how many arms actually executed.  Arm (a) is the one unavoidably textual check -- that the declared
# population and the driver's reading of it are the same list -- and it is a DIFF of two derivations of the
# same file, not an assertion about a spelling.
#
# THE ARMS
#   (a) the driver's arm list == the `test-sequential:` recipe lines, re-derived here independently
#   (b) the live `test:` recipe reaches run_blocking_set.sh (a revert that re-inlines the arms is caught)
#   (c) END TO END: a scratch `make test` with a red at arm 2 of 4 RUNS ALL FOUR and exits non-zero
#   (d) the legacy twin `make test-sequential` on the same scratch tree STOPS at that red -- the difference
#       this row exists to create is measured, never assumed
#   (e) two deliberately red arms are BOTH printed
#   (f) reds and refusals are printed as SEPARATE classes and never summed
#   (g) the denominator closes: green+red+refused == arms, printed
#   (h) all green => rc=0 and the green shape
#   (i) a blocking refusal and no red => rc=2, never 0 and never 1 (a refusal is not a pass)
#   (j) a red anywhere => rc=1 even when refusals are also present
#   (k) a REPORTED (`-`) arm that fails is counted and printed but cannot change the exit code
#   (l) ZERO arms REFUSES rc=2 -- a set that graded nothing must never print the success shape
#   (m) an arm carrying an unexpandable make variable REFUSES rc=2 rather than handing `$(FOO)` to bash
#   (n) an unrecognised flag REFUSES rc=2 instead of absorbing it
#
# FAIL-ONCE PROVEN BEFORE LANDING (hq_T, 2026-09-12, MEASURED not predicted): with `[ "$rc" -eq 0 ] || break`
# added to the driver's loop -- the abort-on-first-red behaviour this row cures, reproduced inside the cure --
# FIVE arms go red together: (c) reports 2 of 4 arms reached, (e) the second red is never printed, (f) the
# class blocks are absent, (g) the summary reads arms=5 green=1 red=1 refused=0 and 1+1+0=2 does NOT close,
# and (j) the run exits 2 instead of 1 because the red after the refusal was never reached.  ⭐ (g) is the
# load-bearing one: the denominator is what makes a partial run impossible to mistake for a clean one, and it
# is the arm that fires no matter WHERE the loop stops.
#
# rc=0 all arms pass / rc=1 a violation / rc=2 cannot measure (no driver, no make, no Makefile).
