# ⭐ RUNG 0 OF frame-slot-reuse-a-live-range-in-a-byrd-graph-extends-to-every-point-reachable-by-recession
# (cto, CEO-684 slice 2).  RUNG 0 IS AN INSTRUMENT, NOT AN OPTIMISATION: --dump-zeta now prints, per graph, the
# INTERFERENCE RELATION over every result slot -- who writes it (spine position), who last reads it, and whether
# any box that can recede sits between the two -- with every recession edge treated as a live edge.  A slot may
# be reused only when the relation can NAME, for a candidate, the absence of any beta landing between its last
# read and the next write.  Until that relation exists and can be READ there is nothing to be conservative WITH.
# ⛔ THE FAILURE MODE THIS LADDER IS DESIGNED AGAINST IS SILENCE, NOT A CRASH: a wrong reuse replaces a value
# with a later one and only an answer-grading test that happens to walk that path can see it.  So the instrument
# is graded on WITNESSES whose recession structure is known by construction, one per class, language-blind:
#   Prolog  frame_r1_witness.pl   -- a staged call (q/1) is a choice point: its own result is PINNED self, always.
#   Icon    every write(1, 1 to 3) -- the literal 1 is written BEFORE the generator `to` and read by write AFTER
#                                  it: the generator is the GUARD and the relation must name IR_TO for it.
#   SNOBOL4 S BREAK('c') . T      -- a pattern box is beta-capable: its result is PINNED self.
# And on the census identity every graph must satisfy: results = candidates + pinned + elided.
# ⛔ WHAT THIS GATE DOES NOT ASSERT, deliberately: the guard on r/1's arithmetic call ($ax_sub) and the
# every-loop pins are the CONSERVATIVE reading and later rungs will narrow them with measured witnesses; pinning
# those here would teach the next rung to keep a false pin.  Only edges that are choice points BY CONSTRUCTION
# (a staged call, a generator, a pattern box) are asserted.
# FAIL-ONCE HOOK: GATE_ZETA_DIR=<dir> grades pre-made w.pl/w.icn/w.sno .zeta files instead of fresh dumps; the
# red-before for this gate was the same three dumps with every reuse line stripped (166 findings, rc=1).
# ⛔ REFUSES rc=2 when --dump-zeta yields no parsable graph on any witness -- a runner that cannot measure never
# prints the success shape.
