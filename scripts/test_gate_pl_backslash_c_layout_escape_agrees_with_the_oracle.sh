# The Edinburgh/SWI layout-skip escape \c inside a quoted atom or a double-quoted token: the backslash and EVERY
# layout character after it produce nothing, so a long quoted string may be continued across a line break. ISO/IEC
# 13211-1 6.4.2.1 names only backslash-newline as the continuation escape, so \c is an EXTENSION -- but no case in
# logtalk_iso, inriasuite, gnu_prolog or gnu_fd contains one (censused hq_C 2026-09-13), while ten shipped swi_tests
# files do, and the swi suite grades by AGREEMENT WITH SWIPL. Rejecting \c cost three whole files at load time
# (queue_gc 0/8, test_yall 0/42, test_syntax 0/38) with no ISO case bought in exchange.
# ⛔ THE EXPECTATION IS CUT FROM THE ORACLE AT RUN TIME, never from our own output: this gate runs swipl on its own
# witness and requires scrip to print the SAME BYTES in m3 and m4. Its last arm is the control in the other
# direction -- an escape the oracle REFUSES (\q) must still be a lex error here, so a cure for \c cannot pass by
# accepting every unknown escape, which is the failure this gate exists to catch.
