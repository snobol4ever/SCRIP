# test_gate_pl_iso_rung1_database_builtins_and_call_local_cut.sh -- PROLOG ISO LADDER, RUNG 1 (cto, CEO-617, 2026-09-12).
# THE RUNG: the database builtins raise the ISO error terms for literal arguments (type_error(callable, T) for a
# number in head or body, permission_error(modify, static_procedure, PI) for a control construct or builtin head,
# permission_error(access, private_procedure, PI) for clause/2 on one, type_error(predicate_indicator, S) and
# abolish's atom/integer/not_less_than_zero/max_arity terms for a bad spec), a directive assert marks its predicate
# dynamic the way a clause-body assert always did, a number in goal position raises type_error(callable) BEFORE
# anything runs (call((write(3), 1)) prints nothing), a cut inside call/1 is local to the call (ISO 7.8.3.3) while
# a cut inside a branch of a disjunction in the SAME scope still prunes it, max_arity is 1024 and functor/3 raises
# representation_error(max_arity) above it, and standard order puts 1.0 before 1 (ISO 7.2.1).
# WITNESS: the Logtalk ISO conformance groups this rung moves, graded by the suite's own grader ONE GROUP AT A
# TIME (--group is the grader's own development aid, never a board) in BOTH modes, against the pass floors
# measured at landing. RED BEFORE (coo board 2026-09-12T15:59:54 at 55aaa01ad, m3): asserta_1 4/24, assertz_1
# 4/24, abolish_1 5/16, retract_1 7/18, retractall_1 6/15, clause_2 8/16, current_predicate_1 4/23, cut_0 13/21,
# call_1 15/20. The floors below are what this rung LANDED at; a later rung may only raise them.

# names OUTSIDE, UNGRADABLE or DEFERRED leaves the floor here, per mode, from its identity line. Every other case must PASS:
# the gate still reds on a lost pass, and a newly admitted case enters the floor the run it enters the population.
