# test_gate_ct_grow_grows_in_place_at_the_frontier_or_allocs_copies_and_abandons.sh -- ct_grow in src/ir/ct_arena.c grows a compile-time block the
# way Lon ruled twice: realloc's two cheap cases (ARCH-DYNAMIC-STORAGE.md § 4.0, Lon 2026-09-23: "grown in place and copy and grown just
# like realloc does. Of course grow in place only occurs at the frontier."; CEO-1211), and otherwise ALLOC, COPY, ABANDON (Lon 2026-09-24
# 12:4x, in-chat to the cfo: "Use the special compile-time heap, and use alloc/copy/abandon at geometric growth for dynamic arrays and
# buffers."; CEO-1244). RE-PINNED 2026-09-25 by the cfo from test_gate_ct_grow_takes_reallocs_contract_and_frees_the_old_block.sh
# (d2efe8a8f), whose case 3 FREED the old block through ct_drop: CEO-1244 supersedes that contract, and every arm below that read a free
# now reads an abandon. Row compiler-every-population-table-grows-in-the-compile-time-arena-through-ct-grow-no-fixed-limit-a-program-can-reach.
#
# ARM 1, the primitive, through a C harness linked against the allocator's own source (no build of scrip needed):
#   1a FITS      a grow within the block's power-of-two class returns the SAME pointer.
#   1b FRONTIER  the last block carved grows IN PLACE: same pointer, payload intact, the frontier advanced.
#   1c MOVES     a block that is not at the frontier moves: a new pointer, the payload copied, and the old block is ABANDONED -- under
#                SCRIP_CT_POISON=1 SCRIP_CT_NORECYCLE=1 its payload still reads the old bytes (a ct_drop would have painted 0xDD), and
#                it is still a block this allocator handed out (a second ct_grow of it returns, where a dropped block refuses rc 3).
#                A cure that went back to freeing reds this arm.
#   1d NO BIN    the abandoned block never returns to a bin: the next same-class allocation is a DIFFERENT block.
#   1e BIG       a block above the 8 MB bin moves to a new mapping with the payload copied, and the old mapping stays readable.
# ARM 2, the snapshot restore in bb_ab_emit_nodes (src/templates/bb/bb_define.cpp) carries the grown op_arg_slot: SCRIP_AB=1 on a
#   program whose first DEFINE has 60 names and whose second has 20 compiles rc 0 (the regression that found the drop's one broken
#   caller, 2026-09-23; kept as the arm that proves the restore still hands back the grown array).
# rc 0 GREEN · 1 RED (named) · 2 REFUSE (cannot measure).
