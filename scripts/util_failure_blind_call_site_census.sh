# util_failure_blind_call_site_census.sh -- census of call sites in src/runtime/ and src/driver/ where a
# language-facing resolve/lookup failure cannot be observed by the caller.
#
# THE SHAPE (task runtime-and-driver-paths-that-cannot-express-failure-censused, minted by hq_U
# 2026-09-05; GOAL-HQ-UNIFY.md; MASTER-PLAN.md seat19 row): a function that stands between a language-
# level event -- a GOTO target, a called entry, a SETEXIT handler -- and the resolve/lookup that answers
# it has no return channel of its own to say "the target did not resolve", so code written after the call
# (which assumes the transfer already happened) runs anyway. rt_goto_transfer is the diagnosed instance
# (.github 671fc125: root-caused end to end, two cure attempts built and reverted -- NOT yet cured).
#
# SCOPE NOTE: the task names "runtime/{core,rt,rtx}" but rt_goto_transfer/rt_goto_resolve/rt_entry_resolve
# themselves live directly under src/runtime/ (runtime_eval.c), outside all three named subdirectories --
# so this census reads the WHOLE src/runtime/ tree plus src/driver/, not just the three subdirs, or it
# would miss its own headline example. src/templates/ and src/emitter/ also call some of these same
# runtime symbols directly from GENERATED code; that is a different layer (the compiled program calling
# in, not a C function calling a C function) and a different census -- deliberately out of scope here.
#
# NEGATIVE CONTROLS, so this script can say NO as well as YES (two-part-proof, RULES.md § INSTRUMENT
# LAWS): rt_entry_resolve's one consumer (rt.c:900) and label_lookup's three consumers in driver_call.c
# plus its one consumer in driver_hooks.c all check their result and escalate correctly. If any of those
# five sites is ever reported below as a candidate, this script is broken, not the runtime.
#
# Exit codes: 0 = census ran and printed (this is what this task's own DONE-WHEN needs -- a census is a
# report, not a pass/fail gate, so a clean run reports 0 even when it lists open candidates below).
#             2 = REFUSE -- could not find the source tree, i.e. could not measure at all.

--- CHECKED THIS SWEEP, RULED OUT (plausible from source alone, not reachable in practice) ---
  src/runtime/runtime_eval.c:335  rt_goto_resolve's `$name`-indirect branch: `if (!inm || !*inm)
                                  { fprintf(stderr, ...); exit(1); }` looks like the same failure-blind
                                  shape (a raw process exit bypassing core_runtime_error, uncatchable by
                                  SETEXIT). Witness tried 2026-09-05: `:($X)` with X unassigned. Verdict:
                                  SCRIP raises ERROR 239 "indirection operand is not name" BEFORE this
                                  point (matches the SPITBOL oracle, both m3), so an empty/null indirect
                                  name never reaches rt_goto_resolve's own check from ordinary source --
                                  this is defensive dead code, not a live gap. (Aside, not this census's
                                  shape: SCRIP prints the ERROR 239 diagnostic TWICE where the oracle
                                  prints it once, and SCRIP's "in statement 0" vs. the oracle's "in
                                  statement 2" -- a real but separate divergence, unfiled, not chased here.)

--- NEEDS A WITNESS (found this sweep, not yet on a filed row -- next rung for this walk) ---
  src/runtime/runtime_eval.c:~341  rt_goto_resolve's `<code>`-value branch has the identical raw-exit(1)
                                   shape as the `$name` branch above for "goto operand in direct goto is
                                   not code". Not yet tried against a real CODE()/`<...>` witness --
                                   unlike the $name case, no upstream check is confirmed to intercept it.
  src/driver/driver_call.c:143     when FNCEX_fn(fname) or FNCEX_fn(ufname) is true and body is still
                                   NULL, control falls through PAST the ERROR-22 arm and returns as an
                                   ordinary RETURN (fr->retval_set ? fr->retval_cell : NV_GET_fn(fr->fname))
                                   with no diagnostic. Unconfirmed whether FNCEX marks a case this can
                                   legitimately defer (e.g. a forward reference resolved by a later pass)
                                   or a live gap -- needs a forward-declared-never-defined-function witness
                                   before it can be filed as a bug.
