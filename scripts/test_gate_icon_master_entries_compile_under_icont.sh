# test_gate_icon_master_entries_compile_under_icont.sh -- THE ICON MASTER GRADABILITY GATE (CEO-483, hq_V
# 2026-09-10; the standing criterion behind CEO-477's one-liner-joiner repair).
#
# THE CRITERION, in the ceo's words: every RUN-GRADED master entry compiles under `icont -s -c`.
#
# ⛔⛔ WHY THIS IS A GATE AND NOT A ONE-OFF SHELL LINE. The joiner defect CEO-477 cured (SCRIP f59db4cd8) put a
# statement terminator INSIDE a construct -- `;` before `else`, before `then`, before a case body's `}`, and
# directly inside `( )`. Every one of those is a SYNTAX ERROR to Arizona icont and a NO-OP to us, so the
# fourteen entries carrying them READ GREEN ON EVERY BOARD while being ungradable against the oracle at all.
# A board cannot see this class: our own frontend accepts the text, so the entry passes, and the fact that the
# oracle could never have compiled it never surfaces. The only instrument that can see it is one that asks the
# ORACLE to compile what the master stores. That is this file, and it is why it must keep running after the
# repair: the joiner is a WRITER, and a writer that regresses re-manufactures the whole class silently.
#
# ⛔⭐ THREE THINGS THIS GATE MUST DO THAT THE OBVIOUS VERSION DOES NOT -- ALL THREE MEASURED 2026-09-10, and
# each one, omitted, turns a GREEN tree into a false red that a reader would route to the joiner's lane:
#
#   (1) PASS --out-in. `extract` REFUSES (by design) to materialize a stdin-bearing entry without it, rather
#       than silently grading a starved witness. Omit the flag and 20 of the 757 entries fail at EXTRACT and
#       are indistinguishable, in a bare exit status, from an entry icont refused. The first cut of this
#       criterion did exactly that and reported 21 refusals where the true count was one.
#   (2) STAGE THE COMPANION CLOSURE. An entry whose text says `$include "prepro.dat"` compiles only where that
#       file resolves beside it. procedure_record_limit_replace_1 (origin rung36_jcon_prepro) is that entry,
#       and in a bare temp dir icont says `"prepro.dat": cannot open` -- a MISSING-FILE error wearing a
#       compile-refusal exit status. The companion is present and declared (corpus/tests/icon/config/); the
#       instrument was simply not giving the entry what the harness gives it when it GRADES it.
#   (3) SEPARATE THE THREE OUTCOMES IN THE REPORT. extract-failed, icont-refused and compiled are three
#       different diagnoses with three different owners. A gate that adds them into one number names the
#       wrong lane, which is worse than no number (RULES.md: a criterion that lies).
#
# ⛔ COMPANIONS COME FROM THE HARNESS'S OWN AUTHORITY, never a second rule written here. _copy_companions() is
# the same function run_suite_entry() uses when it grades, and it already knows the `<dir>/config` convention.
# A private "copy *.dat" lookalike here would drift from the grader the day either side learned a new shape.
#
# ⛔⛔ THIS GATE GRADES THE MASTER PAIR, NOT SCRIP. It never runs ./scrip and no compiler change can move it.
# A red here means the Icon master stores text Arizona icont refuses -- our artifact, our defect, hq_V's lane.

# ⭐⛔ EVERY ENTRY, RUN-GRADED AND AST-GRADED ALIKE (CEO-497, 2026-09-10, ruling hq_V's HQV-19 ask). This gate
# ORIGINALLY selected only entries declaring a RUN mode, on the reasoning that an ast-only entry is never
# compiled by anything so asking icont to compile it grades a witness the suite does not. THAT REASONING WAS
# WRONG, and the counter-example is in this lane's own record: parser/paren_seq and parser/case_multi_clause
# carried INVALID ICON -- write((x := 1; x)) and a trailing semicolon after the last case clause -- for as long
# as our parser tolerated it. Both were ast-graded, both were therefore invisible to this gate AND to every
# board, and they surfaced only because a PARSER cure exposed them (HQV-19). The ceo's ruling states the
# principle better than the exclusion did: an AST fixture that carries invalid Icon pins a parse THE ORACLE
# REJECTS, so the tree it asserts is not Icon's tree. Measured before widening: all 153 ast-graded compile.

# ⛔⭐ THE MASTER IS READ ONCE, NOT 757 TIMES. The obvious loop shells out to `extract` per entry, and
# `extract` re-parses the WHOLE master pair on every call -- 192s MEASURED, which prices this gate out of
# `make test` entirely, and a gate in no runner is not measuring (the false-green shape `test` itself was
# cured of at s268). Materializing every entry from ONE read costs 757 icont invocations and nothing else.
# ⛔ IT IS STILL THE HARNESS'S OWN AUTHORITY: the reader selection below is cmd_extract's, verbatim in
# order and in fallback (block first, one-line second), and the stdin field is carried exactly as
# cmd_extract carries it -- a materializer that dropped it would grade a starved witness, which is the
# defect that reader comment exists for. This is a batching of that function, never a second parser.
