# util_cross_language_regression_diff.sh -- base-vs-patched verdict DIFFERENTIAL over the SNOBOL4,
# Icon and Prolog masters, for a commit or an uncommitted working-tree change (row
# cross-language-regression-differential-over-all-three-open-masters, hq_U, 2026-09-05).
#
# ⛔ MERGE NOTE (seat17, 2026-09-05): this row was independently built twice -- seat17 (this file,
# worktree-based) and seat18 (761eb9353, checkout-in-place) landed within minutes of each other under
# the same re-laning. Resolved as a real merge, not a coin flip: seat18's version is not carried
# forward as-is because its `--base <ref>` checks out that ref IN PLACE in the same checkout the
# script runs from -- undefined behaviour the moment the target ref's copy of this very file differs
# from (or is absent from) the one bash is mid-way through executing, and its stash push has no
# self-exclusion pathspec, so a dirty tree during that script's own development could have stashed
# itself away. Both are exactly the class of hazard this file's worktree + SELF_RELPATH design exists
# to rule out by construction (see below), so this file's mechanics are kept. What IS carried forward,
# because it is a genuine correctness improvement: seat18's diff_lang correctly special-cases a fresh
# XPASS as an improvement, never a regression; classify_deltas below adopts that. hq_U notified
# (override-cross-language-regression-differential-duplicate-build) so the collision and the
# checkout-in-place hazard are on record for whoever owns seat18's row next.
#
# WHY: both cross-language regressions found on hq_U's opening day (the HOST argv staging that burned
# Icon list serial 1; the CAP_NEST rsp-relative capture) were found by a human noticing a board move,
# not by an instrument. This prints the per-entry DELTA -- not absolute counts -- so a moved board is
# visible at landing time instead of a week later.
#
# ⛔ THE TRAP THIS SCRIPT IS BUILT AROUND (FINDING-2026-09-05-hq_T-arbno-null-body-guard...): `scrip`
# carries an ABSOLUTE DT_RUNPATH into this tree's own out/, so a binary COPIED to a "base/" snapshot
# folder silently keeps loading the CURRENT out/libscrip_rt.so -- "0 changed" then means "I diffed one
# arm against itself", never "clean". The cure here is to never copy a binary out of the tree that
# built it: base and patched are measured SEQUENTIALLY, immediately after each build, so whatever is
# on disk when the harness runs IS the arm under test. An md5 canary is printed either way (never
# trusted silently) so an unexpectedly-identical pair is visible, not assumed impossible.
#
# ⛔ RULE (the GOAL this row was minted for): a differential that cannot measure REFUSES (rc=2). It
# never prints a plausible all-zero delta for a build that failed, a run that was killed, or a harness
# that produced no board line -- an empty population reading as a healthy one is what hq_U exists to stop.
#
# Usage:
#   util_cross_language_regression_diff.sh                    # base=HEAD, patched=HEAD+working-tree (stash-and-rebuild, in place)
#   util_cross_language_regression_diff.sh --commit <sha>      # base=<sha>^, patched=<sha> (git worktree -- never touches this checkout)
#   util_cross_language_regression_diff.sh --only snobol4,icon # subset of: snobol4 icon prolog (default: all three)
#   util_cross_language_regression_diff.sh --shard 1/50        # passthrough to corpus_suite_harness.py, for a fast partial read
#   util_cross_language_regression_diff.sh --selftest          # unit-tests the diff engine + refusal paths, then a real build
#                                                               # + self-vs-self measurement of one small shard (~1 min)
#
# Exit codes: 0 = measured, no entry moved PASS->non-PASS (an IMPROVED/stale-XPASS entry does not count).
# 1 = measured, at least one REGRESSED entry.  2 = REFUSED -- could not measure (see stderr).

# classify_deltas base_stderr patched_stderr -- reads corpus_suite_harness.py's `  TAG mode name: detail`
# lines (SUITE_LIST_ALL=1 lifts its default 40-line cap) from each side and prints one TSV row per
# (entry,mode) whose verdict actually changed. Absence in a side means PASS (the harness only names
# non-PASS entries) -- the CALLER must already have proven the run was measured at all (check_measured);
# this function cannot tell "unmeasured" from "measured and all green", by design -- it only ever
# compares two explicit maps.
# ⛔ A FRESH XPASS IS NEVER A REGRESSION (seat18's diff_lang, adopted here): the harness only prints an
# XPASS-tagged line for an entry the SUITE marks xfail that unexpectedly PASSED -- a bug got fixed and
# nobody promoted the marker, exactly as actionable as a fresh FAIL and in the opposite direction. A
# naive PASS-vs-non-PASS classifier reads "absent from base, XPASS in patched" as PASS->non-PASS and
# mislabels a fixed bug as a regression; IMPROVED is its own bucket so the exit code stays trustworthy.
