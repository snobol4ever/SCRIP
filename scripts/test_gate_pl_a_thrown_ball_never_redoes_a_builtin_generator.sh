# test_gate_pl_a_thrown_ball_never_redoes_a_builtin_generator.sh -- a ball thrown after a builtin generator has
# answered must travel to its catch/3, never re-enter the generator as a redo (cto 2026-09-27, CTO-188, found by the
# pl2wam demo row prolog-demo-gnus-wam-compiler-pl2wam-...-ceo-1312).
#
# WHAT THIS PINS. SCRIP wires box N+1's omega to box N's beta, so a ball riding omega lands on the beta of every
# box to its left. ARCH-PROLOG-BYRD-BOX-TRANSLATION.md section A.1 review C9 put the ball test (test r15, r15 ; jne
# own omega) on every beta that can re-enter a RETAINED CALLEE and ruled that a generator leaf needs none because it
# holds no callee. That ruling is false for the IR_TO leaf: its beta IS a redo -- it bumps the counter and answers
# again. between/3, repeat/0 (lowered to between(1, INT64_MAX, _)), sub_atom/5, clause/2, retract/1 and the split
# mode of atom_concat/3 all lower to IR_TO, so in a COMPILED clause body a throw after any of them ran the rest of
# the body once per remaining answer and delivered the ball only when the generator was exhausted. Measured before
# the cure: between(1,3,X), write(X), throw(x) printed 1 2 3 and then caught(x); repeat, throw(x) never returned
# (6.29 million lines before the timeout) -- which is how GNU's pl2wam hung inside its read loop. The meta-called
# forms were already right, which is why no earlier witness saw it. The cure is the ball test on bb_to's Prolog
# beta, after the trail suffix is undone, exactly as bb_disjunction's step does it.
#
# THE REDO ROWS ARE THE CONTROL AND NOT DECORATION. A guard that fires on every beta passes every throw row and
# breaks every failure-driven loop, so each generator is also graded under plain failure, where it must redo.
#
# THE REF IS CUT FROM THE ORACLES: swipl 9 and GNU Prolog 1.6.0 print this text byte for byte (checked when the
# gate was written, 2026-09-27); an error ball is printed by its formal only, because the context term differs
# between them. When swipl is on the box the gate re-cuts the ref from it and refuses rc=2 on disagreement.
#
# RED BEFORE THE CURE (two-part proof, SCRIP 964982d54 with the bb_to change reverted): m3 rc=124, between printed
# 1 2 3 and repeat looped. GREEN AFTER: m3 and m4 byte-identical to the ref.
