# test_snoflake_suite.sh — run Ori Livneh's snoflake fixture suite against SCRIP m3 + m4, plus a
# SPITBOL comparison arm (ARM_SBL=0 to disable).
#
# Suite: corpus/packages/snobol4/snoflake_suite (vendored from github.com/atdt/snoflake test/programs,
# BSD-2-Clause, commit 54f7b801 — see PROVENANCE.md there). Each .sno is a self-describing fixture:
# a header of '*' comment lines carrying @directives, then a program that runs unmodified.
#   @expect (block '* @expect >>>' .. '* <<<' or single-line)  expected output
#   @input  (block)                                            stdin lines
#   @match  exact (default) | substring | error, optional /i   grading mode
#   @nonstandard                                               implementation-defined output
# Block payload strip per upstream test/program-fixture.js: '* <<<' ends, '*' -> empty line,
# '* xxx' -> 'xxx' (exactly the two chars '* ' removed).
#
# ⭐⭐ GRADING IS AGAINST THE ORACLE, NOT AGAINST @expect (ceo CEO-251, 2026-09-04, ruling (a) on hq_B's ask
# `q-snoflake-denominator-vs-the-dialect-law`). A fixture PASSES when SCRIP's output equals `sbl -bf`'s. The
# fixture's own @expect is INFORMATIONAL and is still graded, but only to compute the dialect tally.
# WHY: snoflake tracks SIL 3.11 / CSNOBOL4 and SCRIP follows SPITBOL (RULES.md Semantics), so two thirds of
# this suite's @expect failures were SCRIP agreeing with SPITBOL, i.e. being right. Grading against the oracle
# scores what the law actually requires; the denominator stays 180 and 100% means every fixture matching SPITBOL.
# ⛔ TWO NORMALIZATIONS, BOTH MEASURED, AND THE RULE IS MEANINGLESS WITHOUT THEM:
#   (1) SPITBOL emits its OWN furniture into the compared stream -- banner, `x86-64 <date>`, page headers and a
#       statement listing -- on 56 of these 180 fixtures, driven by `-LIST` control lines INSIDE the fixtures,
#       not by our flags (`-b` already suppresses the signon). Diverted via lib_oracle_flags.sh's
#       sbl_listing_sink_flag (56 -> 0). ⛔ That flag FAILS OPEN: `-o file open error.` in the oracle's output
#       means the listing came back and every comparison is invalid, so this runner REFUSES rc=2 on it rather
#       than scoring the fixture -- a silently re-furnished stream is exactly the false all-FAIL table class.
#   (2) Error TEXT never matches byte-for-byte and never will: SCRIP says
#       `SCRIP: ERROR 248 -- attempted redefinition of system function: SORT` where sbl says
#       `t.sno(40) : ERROR 248 -- attempted redefinition of system function` -- the SAME refusal, with the
#       file/line on one side and the offending name on the other. So errors compare by ERROR NUMBER.
# ⭐ THE DIALECT TALLY is printed beside the score and never folded into it: fixtures that PASS against the
# oracle while FAILING their own @expect, i.e. where SPITBOL itself departs from what snoflake expects.
# @nonstandard fixtures tally as NSTD-PASS/-FAIL and never count in FAIL (implementation-defined output).
#
# ⚠ DIALECT: snoflake tracks SIL 3.11 / CSNOBOL4, NOT SPITBOL. SCRIP follows SPITBOL semantics.
# A FAIL here may be dialect distance, not a defect — check before curing (RULES.md dialect law).
# The @options directive (3 fixtures: case-folding, stlimit) is NOT honored by this runner; those
# fixtures are listed in the OPTS line and their verdicts carry that caveat.
#
# ⛔ A missing suite, compiler, RT, or oracle REFUSES with rc=2 — never skip-as-success
# (FINDING-2026-08-24-hq_C-the-regrid-turned-a-red-board-green.md).
# Exit: 0 iff FAIL3=0 and FAIL4=0 and SKIP(cc)=0 over the printed denominator (verdict = matches the oracle).
