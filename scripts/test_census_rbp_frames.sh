# test_census_rbp_frames.sh -- GOAL-RBP-EARN EARN-2 (2026-08-12/13 s48): re-cut from raw
# frame counting (former GOAL-PASSTHRU-RBP-ERAD PT-0 instrument, Lon directive
# 2026-08-09) to the TWO DEBTS the RUNGS section names: UNEARNED (an establishment
# whose owning construct's classifier says NEVER) and OWED (classifier says
# ALWAYS/hazard-conditional, nothing established). "unearned==0 && owed==0" is the
# ratchet from here, not "frames==0" -- read GOAL-RBP-EARN.md's RUNGS/EARN-2 entry
# before touching this file. Old region-count logic KEPT (still needed for the
# ESTABLISHED side of the debt computation) but is no longer the top-line number.
#
# ⛔ PREREQUISITE LANDED THIS SESSION (SCRIP e73f66b4): frame_need_of()'s diagnostic
# (SCRIP_EARN_DIAG=1, EARN-1 s47) was wired to a choke (bb_prepare) that NONE of its 5
# classified op-kinds ever reached -- [EARN] need=1 was dead code before this fix (5x
# `bb_prepare(nd);` inserted in emit.cpp's IR_MATCH_ARBNO / _FENCE1 / _ASSIGN_{IMM,
# COND,SAVE} case-arms). Byte-identical proven first (crosscheck/patterns 122/122,
# library/probe_reference/bb 14/14) before this script was written against it. If the NEED column below
# reads all-zero on a fresh clone, that fix regressed -- MONITOR-FIRST: do not silently
# reinterpret an all-zero column as "no hazards exist in the corpus".
#
# METHOD
#  NEED side: `SCRIP_EARN_DIAG=1 scrip --compile FILE` (m4). m3 spot-checked per file
#    (scrip --run, same env) and diffed against m4's diag stream -- 0 divergences
#    expected, since the two modes are a 1:1 emission contract by design (PLAN.md
#    architecture); a nonzero divergence count below is itself a finding, not noise.
#    stderr parsed for "[EARN] op=N need=M haz=H ..." lines. N -> name via a table this
#    script DERIVES FRESH FROM IR.h EVERY RUN (never a baked-in table that could go
#    silently stale if the enum is reordered) and refuses to run if any of the 5 names
#    it needs aren't found.
#  ESTABLISHED side: unchanged PT-0 region-label scan (mov rbp,rsp classed by enclosing
#    label prefix) on regenerated mode-4 .s (HONEST CURRENT per the artifact-truth law
#    -- NOT a pinned golden; falls back to a fresh compile if no committed .s exists).
#
#  OWED     = NEED tally for {ARBNO, ASSIGN_IMM, ASSIGN_COND, ASSIGN_SAVE}. FENCE1
#             EXCLUDED (see KEEPER CLASS below). None of the four counted kinds have
#             ANY per-node established mechanism today (ARBNO's old carve died at
#             DEL-T1 -- s46 hand-check: "ARBNO interior frameless post-D-1"; ASSIGN_*
#             never had one), so every firing is unpaid by construction.
#  UNEARNED = PAT-BLOB-class established count ONLY (T1-T3 deletion-target remnants:
#             BLOB-GRANT rbp pin / CLASS D {res,rbp} / legacy in-blob ARBNO rebase).
#  KEEPER CLASS (MAIN + AB-ACT established counts) reported SEPARATELY, counted toward
#             NEITHER debt: {STATEMENT, FUNCTION, MATCH_BEGIN, FENCE1} per the DESIGN OF
#             RECORD's licensed set; EARN-8 explicitly defers their re-examination to a
#             standalone Lon ruling -- scoring them as UNEARNED here would silently
#             answer a question EARN-8 hasn't. ⛔ KNOWN GAP: MAIN-class label scanning
#             cannot distinguish STATEMENT's establishment from FENCE1's -- both land in
#             the same unlabeled main: block. FENCE1's EARNED status is ASSERTED from
#             the design doc (own explicit LEAVE mechanism, bb_match_fence1.cpp) plus
#             its unconditional need=1, not independently proven by per-construct
#             correlation -- the [EARN] line carries no node id to prove it directly.
#             Does not block this rung: FENCE1 sits in neither debt column either way.
#  m3 (BINARY in-process) ESTABLISHED side: NOT INSTRUMENTED. Mode-3 JIT-compiles
#             directly into process memory with no persisted artifact; checked for an
#             existing tool first (test_census_wreg_artifacts.sh's objdump target is
#             libscrip_rt.so, the fixed runtime, not per-program JIT'd code -- doesn't
#             transfer). m4 stands in for both modes' ESTABLISHED count, licensed by the
#             product's own 1:1 mode contract (a separately-gated house law). A real m3
#             probe (gdb JIT-region disasm) is follow-up work, flagged not assumed away.
#
# RATCHET: unearned==0 && owed==0 from here. owed is EXPECTED to be LARGE today and to
# RISE further as EARN classification coverage improves (s29 phase note) -- that is the
# goal succeeding, not regressing.
