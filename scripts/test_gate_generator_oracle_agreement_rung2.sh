# Same instrument as rung 1's gate (test_gate_generator_oracle_agreement.sh), one rung further: widens
# the length-2 operator vocabulary from ('+') to ('+', '-', '*') over the same single-digit operands.
# Population is 10 (length-1, unchanged) + 10*10*3 (length-2, three operators) = 310, exactly, stated
# and checked here so a silent vocabulary change without updating this gate's denominator is refused,
# not passed. See test_gate_generator_oracle_agreement.sh's header for the refusal-path rationale
# (dead/-bf-incapable oracle, empty population, infra failure, real divergence) -- identical here,
# against RUNG=2 and EXPECT_GENERATED=310 instead of rung 1's 1 and 110.
