# test_gate_gc_a_stale_read_of_vacated_ground_faults_and_names_its_block.sh -- RUNG 1 OF ARCH-GC § 9, MEASURED.
#
# ⛔⭐ THE ROW (Lon 2026-09-21, in-chat to the ceo, verbatim: "Now you must discover a technique to automatically
# flush out the GC ... We want things like our sync-step IPC monitor which is iron-clad and guaranteed to self
# measure and self correct."; ceo CEO-1027, ARCH-GC § 9 RUNG 1).  SCRIP_GC_POISON has filled every vacated tail
# with 0xDB since long before this row, AND THAT MEMORY STAYED MAPPED READABLE AND WRITABLE: a stale pointer read
# returned a plausible 0xDB byte, the program printed a wrong answer and exited 0.  0xDB appeared exactly once in
# the whole tree, at the memset that wrote it -- a tripwire nothing was ever attached to.  The cure is page
# protection, not a byte pattern: the fully vacated pages go PROT_NONE, so the stale read SIGSEGVs AT THE
# INSTRUCTION THAT USED THE STALE POINTER and the handler names the block that used to live there.
#
# ⛔ WHY A PLANTED C FIXTURE AND NOT A .sno WITNESS, WHICH IS THE HALF OF THIS ROW THAT WOULD HAVE ROTTED.  The row
# was minted naming hb_mkexpr_unmapped_spine_store.sno as its acceptance and calling it "already red".  IT IS
# GREEN -- 13 band points x 2 modes, guarded by a BLOCKING arm of make test since 2026-09-20 -- so an acceptance
# that demanded a fault from it demanded that a blocking gate go red (cfo 2026-09-21, measured before a line was
# written).  A trap's acceptance may never be somebody else's open defect: the day they cure it the arm goes DARK
# and reads as a pass.  So the subject is a fixture this gate owns and plants itself, and its control arm proves
# the fixture really is a stale read rather than a program that tests nothing.
#
# THE ARMS.  (b) is the DARK reading the row exists to convert -- same binary, same program, SCRIP_GC_TRAP=0,
# exit 0 with a plausible answer.  (c) and (d) are the conversion: signal death, and a report that names the
# block, its kind, its size, its arena offset and whether it was MOVED or RECLAIMED.  (e) is the property a trap
# breaks if it is wrong: after the collection the allocator must get its ground back, so a HEALTHY mutator that
# climbs back through the quarantine never faults.  (f) is the honest limit stated in ARCH-GC § 9 and held here
# rather than promised: mprotect granularity is a PAGE, the quarantine is page-aligned, and the sub-page tail
# under the live top keeps 0xDB and does not trap.  (g) is a real program still answering its oracle-cut ref.
# FAIL_ONCE=1 runs the trap arms with the trap OFF and requires (c) and (d) to red.
