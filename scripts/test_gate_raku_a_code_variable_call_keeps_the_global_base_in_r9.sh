#
# THE DEFECT (the cfo 2026-10-07, row gc-rt-c-c-to-bb-entries-..., found walking the Raku code-variable call road): r9 is the
# global variable area's base for the whole program (RTCC_GLOBAL_R9_GVA: every global reads [r9 + off], rtccb+48 seeds it,
# no box writes it). The staged entry of a block-protocol graph (xa_flat_block_staged_entry, the FN__<name> head that every
# by-name road, glue and C entry jumps to) counted the staged arguments in r9d, so a sub reached through a code variable, a
# pointy block or a recursive code variable died of SIGSEGV at its first read of a global, both modes (fault address 0x8:
# [r9] with r9 = the argument count). A direct call jumps past the staged entry and never showed it.
# THE CURE: the staged entry counts in esi, which already held &g_call_args there and is dead once the block is built.
#
# ARM 1 (the emitted code): in each program's mode-4 .s, the staged entry FN__<name> .. <name>_αblk writes none of r8-r11.
# ARM 2 (the semantics): three programs x two modes print the Rakudo answers, written out below.
# rc=0 clean · rc=1 a divergence · rc=2 REFUSAL.
