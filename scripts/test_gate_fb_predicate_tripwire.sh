# scripts/test_gate_fb_predicate_tripwire.sh — the ζ FRAME-BASE predicate tripwire (ZETA-FB, s160).
#
# WHAT IT GUARDS.  Exactly ONE register is the ζ frame base for a given graph, and THREE places must
# name the same one or the emitted code stores through one base and loads through another (the s158
# 44-test backtrack SIGSEGV, whose land mine was `pop rsp` reading a heap frame base):
#   (1) the PROLOGUE that ESTABLISHES it — xa_flat's jmp-entry hdr `mov rbp,rsp` (gated
#       emit_jmp_pin_rbp) OR xa_flat.cpp:281's gen-proc/resumable heap-frame adopt `mov rbp,rdi`
#       (gated g_gen_proc_active || g_resumable_callable_active);
#   (2) every DATA reference — FR/FRQ via x86_fb_pinned();
#   (3) the 16-byte suspend RECORD protocol — resume-slot store, res-landing pop, beta dispatch,
#       via emit_rec_pin().
# ZETA-FB-2 unified (2) onto emit_rec_pin(), which is the exact disjunction of the two arms in (1),
# so all three now read ONE predicate and cannot drift.
#
# WHAT THIS SCRIPT REPORTS.  The instrument (emit.cpp emit_fb_divergence_check, SCRIP_FB_DIVERGE=1)
# fires whenever the WIDE predicate exceeds the NARROW one for a graph — i.e. whenever a graph enters
# the class `g_gen_proc_active || g_resumable_callable_active` WITHOUT `flat_deep_arrival || flat_pat
# || flat_gen`. That class is REACHABLE BY CONSTRUCTION (flat_gen = is_generator && has_suspend, while
# g_gen_proc_active = is_generator, so a SUSPEND-FREE generator graph is exactly it) but was measured
# EMPTY over 592 corpus programs across four frontends at s160.
#
# A HIT IS NOT A FAILURE — IT IS NEWS, and that is the whole point (the s193 falsifiable-tripwire
# discipline). It means the previously-empty class is now live, so ZETA-FB-2's byte-neutrality claim
# has EXPIRED for that graph and the widening must be re-measured rather than assumed. Default mode
# reports and exits 0; --strict exits 1 on any hit, for a session that wants the class held empty.
