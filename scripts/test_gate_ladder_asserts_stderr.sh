# test_gate_ladder_asserts_stderr.sh -- THE LADDER CAN SEE STDERR, AND SAYS HOW MUCH OF IT NOBODY ASSERTS.
#
# ⛔⭐ THE CLASS (hq_B .github 367b083e; hq_V FINDING-2026-09-09-hq_V-the-ladder-cannot-see-stderr...; ceo CEO-457 item 3):
# lib_ladder.sh graded BOTH modes with `2>/dev/null`, and Icon's &trace writes EXCLUSIVELY to stderr (core.c
# trace_print_icon) -- so every trace rung in the Icon ladder was graded on stdout alone and COULD NOT FAIL FOR THE
# REASON IT WAS MINTED. procedure_write_264 holds the one-line ref `A:end` and PASSES while the oracle prints seven.
# corpus/tests/icon/ALL.ref contains ZERO trace-shaped lines. The Arizona suite runner had it right all along (2>&1),
# which is why tracer.std carries all 85 trace lines: the PACKAGES instrument was right, the LADDER instrument was
# wrong, and the ladder is where rungs are minted.
#
# ⭐ WHAT THIS GATE PINS, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT. It pins that the graded runs CAPTURE stderr and that the
# runner PRINTS THE DEBT. It does NOT pin the ASSERTION MECHANISM -- merged `2>&1` (hq_B: one ref per entry, the
# seven-point standard) versus per-entry ALL.err blocks (hq_V: additive, all 886 refs untouched) is an open ceo
# decision, and a gate that pinned one would decide it by default. ⛔ A gate must not settle an argument its author
# has referred upward; that is how a ruling gets made by whoever wrote the test first.
#
# ⭐ THE DEBT COUNTER IS PART OF THE CURE, NOT DECORATION: capturing stderr without reporting how much of it no block
# asserts would replace a silent false green with a silent uncompared stream -- the same defect one step quieter.
#
# ~1s, hermetic (pure source census plus one scratch run), no build, no corpus dependency.
# EXIT: 0 all arms · 1 an arm failed · 2 REFUSED (cannot measure).
