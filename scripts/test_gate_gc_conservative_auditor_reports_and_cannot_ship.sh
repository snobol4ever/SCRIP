# test_gate_gc_conservative_auditor_reports_and_cannot_ship.sh -- RUNG 3 OF ARCH-GC § 9, MEASURED.
#
# ⛔⭐ THE GRANT AND ITS EXPIRY.  Lon 2026-09-21, in-chat to the ceo, verbatim: "So if you need a conservative
# scan temporarily to get your diagnostics done, then go ahead.  But ensure in the end all is exact scanning."
# A GRANT WITH AN EXPIRY AND NO REMOVAL MECHANISM IS A PERMANENT GRANT, so the expiry is built, not promised.
# This gate is the four structural conditions of that grant, each as an arm that can fail:
#   (a) THE SHIPPED BUILD CARRIES ZERO CONSERVATIVE SCAN -- measured on the .so, not read off the source.
#   (b) AND THE CENSUS IN (a) IS NOT BLIND -- the same census over the knob-on build MUST see it.  Fail-once in
#       both directions on one tree: the auditor exists only under -DSCRIP_GC_AUDIT_B, so the shipped library is
#       silent because THE CODE IS NOT IN IT, which is a stronger statement than a runtime flag defaulting off.
#   (c) PASS A ALWAYS DECIDES -- source census that pass B calls nothing that marks, forwards, frees or protects,
#       AND a behavioural arm: one binary, one library, auditor OFF against ON, stdout and collection count
#       IDENTICAL.  An auditor that changed a collection would change one of those two.
#   (d) THE AUDITOR CLAIMS ITS OWN EVENT -- it prints `audited=1` per collection and `findings=0` out loud, so
#       its SILENCE is a statement rather than an absence, and a run where it never applied REFUSES rc=2 rather
#       than passing.  The cto's shift plant taught this class twice in one day.
#   (e) EVERY HOLDER IS CURED OR DECLARED -- scripts/gc_audit_b_declared.txt.  An undeclared holder is a RED, so
#       the count falls only by curing roots or by writing down a measurement.
#   (f) THE EXPIRY IS STRUCTURAL -- the day no OPEN row remains and a sweep finds nothing, THIS ARM PRINTS
#       RETIREMENT-PENDING AND NAMES THE ROW THAT DELETES IT.  A disabled auditor is a conservative scan wearing an if.
#       ⛔ AMENDED 2026-09-26 (cfo, the ceo's CEO-1291 ruling (b)): this arm used to RED at open_rows=0 holders=0, and
#       the g_icn_op cure made that day arrive.  But this gate sweeps FOUR witnesses and ARCH-GC section 9 condition (3)
#       grades the retirement over the CORPUS across a declared window, which under CEO-1232 only the language HQs may
#       run.  So the silence here is necessary, not sufficient: it reads GREEN with RETIREMENT-PENDING printed, and the
#       deletion is graded by row gc-the-conservative-auditor-retires-on-six-hq-receipts-each-master-under-the-auditor-build-at-stress-1-and-3-reads-zero-findings
#       (six receipts, one per language HQ: its master under this auditor build at stress 1 and 3 at the shipped
#       arena, zero findings), whose own landing deletes everything (f1) lists.
# ⛔⭐ (d3) AND (e2) STAND ON A PLANT SINCE 2026-09-26 (cfo, the CEO-1274 board row; CEO-554).  Both were keyed on a holder the
# sweep FOUND, and when 957efcc7c took the lc_vec class off the collected heap the sweep found none and both went red on a
# correct tree: a proof that needs a live defect dies of the cure.  SCRIP_GC_PLANT_UNROOT=1 exists ONLY in the auditor build
# (#ifdef SCRIP_GC_AUDIT_B in gc_heap.c's root phase): it skips drv_gc_roots, so g_fh -- this detector's first real find --
# is a lost root on purpose, and pass B must name it.  The unplanted sweep still grades every real holder in (e1) and (f1).
#
# ⛔ COST, MEASURED (cfo 2026-09-21, load 2.7-5.3, SCRIP_HEAP_MB=1).  The auditor's own build is a separate RT_TAG
# and is built HERE, directly as out/libscrip_rt-<tag>.so, which is a target in its own right: the canonical
# out/libscrip_rt.so symlink is NEVER touched, so a shard running in parallel cannot pick up this library by
# accident.  COLD (no cached tag, e.g. after `make pristine`) that build is 2m25s; CACHED it is 0.2s.  The run
# arms are 4 witnesses chosen for having FEW collections.  The auditor itself costs 185x wall on a 36-collection
# witness (0.01s -> 1.85s) and 99.97% of that is one region: libscrip_rt.so's 89 MB writable PT_LOAD, which is
# .bss tables (dat_types 18 MB, zf 16 MB, ze and zm 8 MB each), NOT the program's heap.  So pass B's cost is a
# property of the LIBRARY and not of the workload, and SCRIP_GC_AUDIT_B_POPS narrows the territory with the
# narrowing PRINTED in every summary line.
