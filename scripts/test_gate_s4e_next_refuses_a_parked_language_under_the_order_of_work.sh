# ⭐⭐ GATE: `next` REFUSES A ROW OF A LANGUAGE THE ORDER OF WORK HAS PARKED -- AND SAYS SO.
# Row `snobol4-icon-postoffice-next-refuses-a-row-of-a-language-parked-by-the-order-of-work-on-mode-line-2`
# (CEO-489, hq_P). ⛔ THE MEASURED DEFECT, 2026-09-10: MODE line 1 read NONET and line 2 carried
# `THE ORDER OF WORK IS ICON ONLY`, and `s4e_msg.sh next` served hq_P a rank-0 SNOBOL4 row through the
# owner-cell pass. The picker DID hold a language-freeze check; its extractor matched exactly one spelling,
# `ON <LANG> ONLY`, and the ceo had written `IS ICON ONLY`. The extractor returned EMPTY, empty is
# documented in the picker as NO FREEZE (never "undetermined"), and so every parked-language row in the
# queue became servable -- silently, with no refusal to read. The only thing between an idle seat and hours
# of parked-language work was the seat remembering to refuse.
# ⛔ WHY THE EXISTING GATE WAS GREEN THROUGH ALL OF IT: test_gate_next_honours_the_lane_cut.sh has a
# freeze arm, and its fixture writes `ON SNOBOL4 ONLY` -- the one spelling the parser knew. The gate and the
# code under test shared the assumption, so the canary died with the guard. ⭐ THIS GATE'S FIRST ARM IS
# THEREFORE THE LIVE PROSE VERBATIM, not a spelling chosen to suit the parser: an arm that grades a fixture
# written to match the implementation grades nothing.
# ✅ THE CURE UNDER TEST: THE ORDER OF WORK is DECLARED in a machine line the bus reads --
#     ORDER-OF-WORK: icon
# -- the whitespace/comma-separated list of LIVE languages, matched BY MARKER anywhere in MODE (never by
# line number: the ceo prepends each dated entry, so a positional line would be shoved down by the next
# announcement and start answering for a superseded order of work). Absent marker falls back to the prose
# parse, now widened to the `IS` form as well, so the cure never reads as a loosening.
# ARMS: (a) the live `IS` spelling parks a rank-0 SNOBOL4 row and the icon row is served instead
#       (b) the skip is PRINTED, naming the parked topic and the order of work -- never a silent skip
#       (c) the marker line alone parks it, with no ONLY clause in prose anywhere
#       (d) the marker is AUTHORITATIVE OVER PROSE in the opening direction (marker snobol4 vs prose ICON)
#       (e) THE ORDER OF WORK IS A SET, not one language: `icon snobol4` serves the SNOBOL4 row
#       (f) `ORDER-OF-WORK: all` restricts nothing
#       (g) POSITIVE CONTROL -- no marker and no ONLY clause: the SNOBOL4 row is served (no misfire)
#       (h) the marker is found deep in the file, and the FIRST of several wins (prepend-newest)
#       (i) a language-neutral topic is never parked by any order of work
#       (j) an EXPLICIT ASSIGNMENT outranks the order of work -- the ceo dispatching a parked-language row
#           by name is a deliberate direction, the same precedent `claim` and the rank cap already set
#       -- ARMS (k)..(o) added hq_S 2026-09-10, THE SAME DEFECT ONE OPERAND OVER (see below) --
#       (k) a row whose SLUG names no language but whose BATON names SNOBOL4's own witnesses is parked
#       (l) POSITIVE CONTROL for (k) -- a slug-neutral row whose baton names NO language's witnesses IS served
#       (m) a DECLARED `LANGUAGE:` line in the baton parks the row on its own, with no witness path anywhere
#       (n) AMBIGUITY STAYS NEUTRAL -- a baton naming TWO languages' witnesses is served, so the cure can
#           only ever TIGHTEN: no row the freeze already refused becomes servable because of it
#       (o) the SLUG still outranks the baton -- an `icon-` row whose baton greps SNOBOL4 is served under ICON
# HERMETIC: builds its own scratch postoffice under mktemp; reads and writes nothing under /home/resources.

# ⛔⭐⭐ ARMS (k)..(o) -- THE SLUG IS NOT THE ONLY PLACE A ROW'S LANGUAGE LIVES (hq_S 2026-09-10).
# MEASURED, and found by being SERVED one: under this same MODE (NONET, THE ORDER OF WORK IS ICON ONLY),
# `s4e_msg.sh next` LOCKED hq_S onto `input-open-failure-not-signaled` -- a row whose GOAL reads "INPUT() ...
# the oracle (sbl -bf) ... Witness: simple_output_62 in corpus/tests/snobol4/ALL.sno". The freeze check RAN
# and passed it: the slug carries no `snobol4-` prefix, the prefix table returned empty, and empty means
# LANGUAGE-NEUTRAL. The picker printed ⛔ SKIP for four prefixed SNOBOL4 rows and then handed out an
# unprefixed one, in the same run, four lines apart.
# ⭐ THIS IS CEO-489'S OWN DEFECT ON THE OTHER OPERAND, and that is why it belongs in THIS gate rather than a
# new one. CEO-489 cured an extractor that answered "does MODE contain `ON <LANG> ONLY`?" while being read as
# "what is the order of work?". This one is an extractor that answers "does this SLUG start with a language
# prefix?" while being read as "what language is this ROW?". Both fail OPEN -- they leak parked work rather
# than idle a seat -- so neither announces itself: a seat that is served a row does not audit why.
# ⛔ AND ARM (i) ABOVE IS WHY THE GATE COULD NOT CATCH IT: it pins that a language-neutral topic is never
# parked, using a fixture whose baton says "GOAL: fixture". Every slug-neutral row looked like arm (i) to
# this gate, the real ones included. The fixture and the code shared the assumption a second time -- the
# same "a guard and its own canary must not share a failure mode" this file's header already records.
# MEASURED on the live queue the day these arms landed: 452 servable rows, 165 slug-NEUTRAL; of those 165,
# 39 name exactly one language's witness paths or oracle in their baton (28 snobol4, 5 prolog, 6 icon).

# the way both earlier instances of this class were found: BY BEING SERVED ONE). Under MODE NONET with THE
# ORDER OF WORK IS ICON ONLY, `next` printed sixteen ⛔ SKIP lines for snobol4 rows and then LOCKED this seat
# onto `corpus-import-roast-subset` -- a RAKU row (import the roast spec suite into corpus/packages/raku/roast/).
# The witness matcher answered BOTH raku (right) AND snobol4 (WRONG): the baton names the convention it copies,
# "the packages/ import pattern beside gimpel/csnobol4_suite/ipl/jcon", and the `csnobol4_suite` marker convicts
# a row that cites that directory AS A NAMING PRECEDENT. Two candidates, so the classifier returned empty, so

# in the direction that matters -- a row a CORRECT classifier would have PARKED gets SERVED.

# invocations containing `file.sno` and `file.sc`. PLACEHOLDER filenames, read as witnesses. Teaching the
# matcher about `file.<ext>` is one witness wide and the next placeholder is `prog.sno`; declaring neutrality
# is permanent and readable. DECLARED beats INFERRED, extended to the answer inference cannot safely reach.

# in the file and is inert in the bus is worse than no marker -- it is believed by the reader and by nobody
