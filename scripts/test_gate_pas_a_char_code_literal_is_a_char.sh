# test_gate_pas_a_char_code_literal_is_a_char.sh -- #n and #$h are character literals of ordinal n, #0 included (FPC)
#
# MEASURED 2026-09-25 by hq_pascal, both modes, row pascal-every-suite-to-100-under-nonet-ceo-1266. pascal.l lexed #n into a one-byte C
# string returned as STRINGCONST, and every grammar site decides "char, not string" by strlen == 1, so #0 -- a NUL, strlen 0 -- became
# the empty string: c := #0 was refused as a string assigned to a char (6.4.6), and x <> #0 compared a char with ''. FPC
# test_tparray10 halted at its unone[3] <> #0 check with every element right (0 0 65 66 67 68 0 0 0); with #0 spelled chr(0) it matched
# its ref. NO BRACKET FOR THIS DEFECT: the monitor stops that program earlier, at step 7 (s := pacone stores the packed array's
# internal form into a string -- a separate defect whose value never reaches output there), so it was found by ablation. The cure: #n
# and #$h lex to a CHARCODE token carrying the ordinal, and the four sites that take a char literal (a factor, a constant definition,
# a scalar constant, a subrange's low bound) take it; the two new shift/reduce conflicts are the exact twins of STRINGCONST's, resolved
# by shift to the specific rule.
#
# ARMS: one program cut LIVE from fpc -Miso and required byte-identical in BOTH modes: #0 assigned and compared, #n and #$h in a
# constant definition, a subrange type #0..#31, array elements, and case labels #0 #32 #64 #$60. It FAILS on the parent (refused at
# compile). OPEN EDGE, NOT GRADED HERE: low/high of a char subrange TYPE read 0/255 and print as integers (on the parent too).
# FAIL_ONCE=1 corrupts the ref to prove it can fail.
