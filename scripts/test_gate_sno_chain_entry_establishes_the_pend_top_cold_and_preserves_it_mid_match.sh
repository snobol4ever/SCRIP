# (hq_U 2026-09-13, concern 3 ZETA STORAGE / register planes; cold arms and their generator are hq_S's, from
#  FINDING-2026-09-13-hq_S-seeding-r12-from-the-base-cures-the-cold-chain-entry-and-silently-destroys-an-outer-pending-capture-mid-match.md)
#
# THE CLASS. r12 is the dcap PEND TOP -- the pending-capture/replacement stack that bb_match_end stores through.
# Generated code establishes it once, in the program prologue, from the cell at RT_DCAP_TOP; every box from then
# on treats it as a machine-wide invariant. Inside the C runtime r12 is an ORDINARY callee-saved register, so the
# two trampolines that jump into a compiled chain FROM C -- rt_chain_enter / rt_chain_enter_v -- hand the chain
# whatever C left there. That is wrong in TWO OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS and a cure that only knows one of them is worse
# than no cure:
#   COLD (no match live): r12 is C's own value (measured 0x68) and the chain's first replacement stores through
#     it and SIGSEGVs. Arms 1-3.
#   MID-MATCH (a match is live): r12 IS the live pend top, carried in by callee-save propagation. Seeding it
#     UNCONDITIONALLY from the cell resets the top to the base, the inner chain pends from there, and the OUTER
#     match's already-pending capture is overwritten -- a WRONG ANSWER AT rc=0. Arm 4.
# ⭐ ARM 4 IS WHY THIS GATE EXISTS SEPARATELY FROM A COLD-ONLY ONE. A gate whose whole population evaluates
# outside a live match cannot see the mid-match direction, and the unconditional seed passes all of arms 1-3.
#
# Every arm is graded against the ORACLE's own output in BOTH modes, refs cut on this run, and the oracle is run
# TWICE and diffed against ITSELF first (refuse rc=2 if it differs).
