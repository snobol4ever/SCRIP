# util_gc_decidable_roots.sh -- hq_snocone's DECIDABLE TEST (coo, CEO-818/819 § 7 F6 step 6):
#   CAN A SUITE BE GREEN WHILE THE COLLECTOR DOES NOT FIND THE ROOTS?
#
# The question is decidable with one witness and three runs.  scripts/fixtures/gc_roots_witness.sno holds one value of
# EVERY registered zeta slot kind (src/ir/frame_layout.h: ZK_DESCR, ZK_PTR_GC, ZK_PTR_CODE, ZK_RAW) live across the
# whole program and prints all of them at the end, so a lost root is a wrong byte and never a silence:
#
#   ORACLE     sbl -bf                                  -- the reference bytes; no oracle is rc=2, never a verdict
#   QUIET      mode 3 and mode 4, SCRIP_GC_STRESS=0     -- no collection runs: this is what a suite measures
#   COLLECTED  mode 3 and mode 4, SCRIP_GC_STRESS=1     -- with the poison fill ON, so a freed root reads 0xDB
#
# VERDICT (rc):
#   0  NO  -- QUIET green and COLLECTED green: a green reading implies the collector found every kind of root.
#   1  YES -- QUIET green and COLLECTED red: the suites are green because they never collect.  This is the state the
#             frozen design closes; it is the acceptance witness for the walker (F6 step 3) and the typed visitors (5).
#   2  NOT MEASURED -- no oracle, a stale binary, or QUIET itself red (then the red is not about the collector).
#
# Every run prints its bytes beside the oracle's, so the reader re-derives the verdict and never only reads it.
