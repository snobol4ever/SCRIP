# ⛔⭐ GIT HOOKS DO NOT PROPAGATE THROUGH CLONE. A hook that lives in one seat's .git/hooks
# protects one seat. That is why this installer exists and why it is invoked from the
# per-prompt session path (scripts/s4e_inbox_hook.sh) rather than from `make setup`:
# MEASURED 2026-08-30 -- `make setup` runs `bash $ROOT/setup.sh`, and setup.sh DOES NOT EXIST
# in this tree, so wiring installation there would have installed nothing, forever. Same
# defect class as the graders that refused over a population that had moved: a mechanism that
# exists, looks wired, and cannot fire. `make hooks` is provided as the explicit manual entry
# point and `make setup` now runs it first.
#
# Idempotent and silent when already current: it rewrites a hook only when the bytes differ,
# so the per-prompt call costs a cmp and nothing else.
