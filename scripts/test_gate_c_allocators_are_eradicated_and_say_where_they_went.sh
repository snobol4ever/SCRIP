# test_gate_c_allocators_are_eradicated_and_say_where_they_went.sh -- THE GATE ON LON'S ERADICATION ORDER
# (coo, CEO-842/843; RULES.md FACT RULE line 29).
#
# LON'S ACCEPTANCE TEST IS TEXTUAL AND IT IS HIS: "Eradicate ALL usage of malloc, calloc, free, and realloc.
# At the end ensure 0 instances found in the SCRIP source base."  So the count must fall to 0 over the WHOLE
# tree -- src/parsers and the checked-in generated flex/bison output included.
#
# ⛔⭐ BUT THE COUNT ALONE IS NOT THE VERDICT, and that is the ceo's own warning (CEO-843, verbatim): "a census
# that only counts the four names would read green on a tree where half the runtime quietly lives outside the
# collector."  The rule names three destinations -- the collected heap WITH A ROOT for anything the running
# program can reach, the compile-time arena for what only the compiler touches, mmap for the collector's own
# bookkeeping -- and THE ARENA MAY NOT HOLD ANYTHING THE RUNTIME CAN REACH.  An arena allocation under
# src/runtime is the same evasion as malloc or a pin, one name further out -- ⛔ BUT ONLY WHEN THE SITE CAME OFF
# THE COLLECTED HEAP, which is the split CEO-846 ordered and which arm (c) now makes.
#
# ⛔ THE RULE IS AUTHORITATIVE WHILE THE CURE DOES NOT EXIST (RULES.md line 29), exactly as it is for xfail, so
# THIS GATE IS RED TODAY BY DESIGN -- 1182 sites at the order.  What it enforces meanwhile is the RATCHET: the
# counts may only fall, and a fall the baseline has not recorded is just as red as a rise, because a ratchet
# nobody tightens is a ratchet that lets the next regression back in.  The gate's own verdict is the ratchet's,
# never the census's; a census RED is the design state, not this gate's failure.
#
# ARMS: (a) the census's own selftest -- planted violations trip, a clean fixture passes, a vacuous zero refuses
#       (b) the census runs on this tree and prints its population (a REFUSAL here is rc=2, never green)
#       (c) ARENA-IN-RUNTIME is 0 -- the anti-evasion clause, the population a four-name grep cannot see
#       (c) THE ARENA CLASS SPLIT (CEO-846): class 1, a site that was on the COLLECTED HEAP and is now in the
#           arena, is the evasion and a HARD red; class 2, a site that was a libc malloc and is now in the
#           arena, is transitional DEBT with the lifetime it already had and is ratcheted to zero instead.
#           Without scripts/c_allocator_sites_baseline.tsv the split is not computable and this REFUSES rc=2.
#       (d) the ratchet holds against scripts/c_allocator_baseline.tsv
#       (f) MARK THE CONTAINER, NOT ONLY WHAT IT POINTS AT (CFO-96/97) is graded and printed, with its limit
#       (g) WHO OWNS THE BLOCK (CEO-850): a block libc owns handed to the arena's free or to a collector root.
#           Six today, every one named. NOT the twelve-name census, which RULES.md line 29 says lands with its
#           cure -- this names an open door rather than printing a zero over one.
#       (e) the census still ANSWERS both halves of CEO-844: it resolves alias CHAINS and counts the calls made
#           through them, and it reports licence prose APART from the count.  An instrument that goes quiet on
#           either clause reads green while the thing it was built to see walks past it -- the alias chain
#           `#define YYSTACK_ALLOC YYMALLOC` over `#define YYMALLOC malloc` is invisible to a four-name grep AND
#           to one level of alias reading, and the GPL sentence "This program is free software" is not usage.
# FAIL_ONCE=1 blanks the selftest's proof so arm (a) is seen to trip.
# EXIT: 0 every arm · 1 an arm failed · 2 REFUSED (no python3, no census, no baseline).
