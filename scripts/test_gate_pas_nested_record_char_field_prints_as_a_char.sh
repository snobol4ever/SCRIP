# test_gate_pas_nested_record_char_field_prints_as_a_char.sh -- a CHAR field of a NESTED record is a char, not its ordinal
#
# MEASURED 2026-09-13 by the coo on origin c24f64cc1, both modes, while extending the witness for the array-field row
# (the same family, a different site): p^.sub.tag := 'q'; writeln(p^.sub.tag) printed 113 where fpc -Miso prints q, and
# r.sub.tag the same through a record variable. A char field at the TOP level of a record was already right -- q.c and
# p^.c both print their character -- so the loss is specific to the nested hop.
#
# THE MECHANISM, and it is two halves that had to be read together:
#   1. pas_nested_field_resolve built the nested selector and marked only its ENUM type and the nrec shape. The one-level
#      resolver marks three more things on the node it builds -- fldca (packed array of char), fldna (array of anything
#      else) and fldchar -- and the nested resolver marked none of them, so a nested field arrived downstream with its
#      declared type erased.
#   2. Marking it was not enough: at `factor: selector` the nrec rewrite CONSUMES the selector node and hands back a
#      fresh __pas_nrec_get call, so any mark on the consumed node dies with it. The mark has to be carried onto the
#      node that survives.
# ⛔ WHAT WAS TRIED AND REVERTED, because it is the obvious cure and it is wrong: wrapping the read in __pas_chr at that
# site. The writeln/write argument path already wraps a char expression itself, so the two wraps compose to chr(chr(n)),
# __pas_chr clamps a non-integer to 0, and the witness prints an EMPTY LINE instead of a wrong number -- a defect that
# looks less like a defect. Carrying the mark lets the one existing wrap do its job exactly once.
#
# ARMS: one program, both modes, byte-identical to fpc -Miso -- a nested char field through a POINTER and through a
# record VARIABLE, a top-level char field beside each (the half that already worked, so a regression there is visible),
# a nested integer and a nested real (the neighbours the mark must not disturb), and ord() of a nested char to prove the
# value itself was never wrong, only its rendering. FAIL_ONCE=1 corrupts the first line to prove the diff arm trips.
