# test_gate_gc_acceptance_never_prints_a_number_over_a_refusal.sh -- the coo, 2026-09-22, MODE DECTET.
# RULES.md THE INSTRUMENT LAWS: an instrument that reports success while doing nothing is THE recurring failure;
# a missing prerequisite is rc=2, never green.  util_gc_acceptance.py's own docstring says it of itself:
# "a metric that CANNOT BE MEASURED prints NOT-BUILT or NOT-MEASURED and makes the verdict REFUSE(2).  It never
# prints 0 and never prints 100.  A display that cannot tell 'clean' from 'never ran' is the thing this whole
# emergency is about."  IT DID NOT HOLD ITSELF TO THAT, AND NOTHING POLICED IT: before this gate the acceptance
# display -- the ONE reading MODE's ORDER OF WORK makes all ten seats print at the end of EVERY turn -- was not
# wired into `make test` at all.
#
# ⛔⭐ THE DEFECT, MEASURED 2026-09-22 21:2x CDT ON THIS TREE, NOT REASONED FROM THE SOURCE.
# util_gc_acceptance.py invoked three sub-instruments as `rc, out = sh(...)` and READ THE rc IN NONE OF THEM; the
# name was then rebound by the next section, which is how it stayed invisible through six weeks of edits.  Two
# distinct costs, and the second is the dangerous one:
#
#   1 THE WRONG CURE NAMED.  With a binary older than src/ the census REFUSES(2) and prints no counts.  The display
#     said "the census did not print a line this reader needs" -- which reads as an OUTPUT-SHAPE defect and sends
#     the next seat to edit util_gc_census.py.  The actual cure was `make`.  Measured: census rc=2, the display's
#     verdict block naming the census's output instead of the build.
#
#   2 A REFUSED MEASUREMENT PRINTED AS A PERFECT SCORE.  util_gc_event_coverage.py returns 2 at TWO points that sit
#     AFTER its DENOMINATOR IDENTITY line is already printed -- "no ratchet floor" (its line 403) and "cannot read
#     gc_heap.c to re-assert the ABSENT events" (line 378).  So EXERCISED and OBSERVABLE parse cleanly out of a run
#     that REFUSED TO MEASURE, the rc is dropped, and item 2 VISIBILITY prints:
#         declared events observed          16 / 16     100.0%
#     A full-marks line over an instrument that measured nothing.  THAT is the shape the docstring forbids, on the
#     display the whole fleet reads, and no arm anywhere would have seen it.
#
# ⛔ WHY THIS GATE USES A REAL TRIGGER AND NOT A SYNTHETIC ONE.  Arm 1 removes the ratchet floor -- a state the
# instrument itself documents and offers a cure for ("create it with --raise-floor"), reachable by any seat on a
# fresh clone before the floor is written.  A gate that can only fire against a hand-forged stub proves the stub.
#
# ARMS. (1) with the floor moved aside the event-coverage instrument prints its identity AND exits 2, and the
# acceptance display must print NO percentage for VISIBILITY and must carry THAT INSTRUMENT'S OWN REASON.
# (2) FAIL-ONCE PROOF: the same trigger against a copy of the display with the rc guard disabled -- exactly the
# pre-cure code -- must print the false 100%, so arm 1's assertion is shown to be capable of failing.  (3) with the
# floor restored the display prints the VISIBILITY counts again: the cure must not mint a permanent refusal.
# ⛔ This seat holds no cure lane (CEO-723) and edits no src/: the display and the gate are instruments.
