# util_census_unrooted_static_gc_pointers.sh -- THE CLASS cto NAMED (2026-09-22, on hq_icon's trace_tab finding
# and hq_snocone's RTCCB spill-slot finding, THIRD INSTANCE THAT HOUR): a static or file-scope C object that
# stores a pointer obtained from the collected GC heap and is never walked by any typed root-visitor. This is
# the ROOT-DOES-NOT-EXIST shape, distinct from the safe-point census (which counts POLLS AT CALL SITES): a
# missing root is invisible to that census by construction, because there is no call site to miss a poll at --
# the pointer just sits in memory nothing ever visits, and the arena reissues its bytes on the next collection.
#
# WHAT THIS IS: a heuristic three-pass grep instrument, not a proof. It (1) lists file-scope `static`
# declarations under src/runtime that are pointers or arrays of a pointer-holding type, (2) checks whether each
# name is ever ASSIGNED from a named GC-heap allocator wrapper in the SAME FILE, (3) checks whether each name
# ever appears inside the BODY of any *_gc_roots-family function (wherever in the tree that function lives).
# A name that is BOTH sourced and unvisited is the population this instrument reports.
#
# ⛔ WHAT IT CANNOT SEE, NAMED RATHER THAN HIDDEN (same discipline as
# test_gate_c_allocators_are_eradicated_and_say_where_they_went.sh's own arm 11 census): sourcing or visiting
# through a HELPER FUNCTION, a MACRO, or a DIFFERENT FILE than the declaration's own is invisible to a same-file
# grep. A name that collides with an unrelated identifier (a local variable, a struct field of the same
# spelling) can print a false negative (looks visited when it is not) or a false positive census entry that a
# reader must still verify by hand -- this script found 286 raw static-shaped lines and roughly 230 of them were
# noise (static FUNCTIONS with a pointer return type, single-letter extraction artifacts, the collector's own
# gc_heap.c bookkeeping, and function-pointer dispatch tables that point at CODE, never at collected data).
# ⭐ SO THIS SCRIPT PRINTS A CANDIDATE LIST FOR A HUMAN (OR A SEAT) TO READ, NOT A VERDICT A GATE CAN FAIL ON.
# Turning it into a gate needs a per-name ALLOWLIST of confirmed-safe statics (ct_*-family allocations, raw
# argv, fixed-size non-pointer buffers, compile-time-only tables written before any user code can run) --
# that allowlist does not exist yet, and building it without running each witness is exactly the "a census
# that counts the wrong population is wrong for every member of it" trap this codebase warns about elsewhere.
#
# Usage: bash scripts/util_census_unrooted_static_gc_pointers.sh [src-dir]
