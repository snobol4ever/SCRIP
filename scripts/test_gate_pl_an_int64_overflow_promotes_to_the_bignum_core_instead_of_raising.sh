# test_gate_pl_an_int64_overflow_promotes_to_the_bignum_core_instead_of_raising.sh -- PROLOG ISO LADDER (cto, 2026-09-13).
# THE SUBJECT: every arithmetic site that raises evaluation_error(int_overflow) where the oracle PROMOTES to the
# bignum core this tree already carries. The population is ENUMERABLE BY GREP and that is deliberate: it is
# exactly the set of lines matching rt_pl_ball_eval_error("int_overflow", ...) -- 8 lines across
# src/runtime/by_name_dispatch.c and src/runtime/unification.c, covering neg/1 abs/1 //2 div/2 +/2 -/2 */2
# succ/2 plus/3. A class defined by a property nobody can grep is a class that grades itself green.
# ⛔ THE ROW THAT MINTED THIS GATE SAID THE CLASS WAS ONE VALUE WIDE. THAT WAS FALSE AND ARM b IS WHY:
# 9223372036854775807 + 1 needs no INT64_MIN, was reachable from an ordinary literal long before the rung-8
# negative-literal cure, and raises today. The five INT64_MIN witnesses are a CORNER of the class -- the corner
# the reader cure made reachable -- not the class. Arm a is that corner; arm b is the general case; arm c is the
# two predicate sites, which are in the population by the same grep and answer the same way in the oracle.
# ⛔ THE ARMS DISCRIMINATE, THEY ARE NOT A TRIPWIRE (cto's law THE UNEXPLAINED GREEN, hq_B's two-lever bar):
# arms a-c are the subject; arms d-f are CONTROLS THAT PASS IN BOTH TREES -- the three readings that were always
# correct at INT64_MIN (sign, +1, comparison), in-range arithmetic that must not change representation, and the
# wide-literal path rung 8 already holds. A regression in bignum.c lights d-f; a regression in the guards lights
# only a-c. So this gate names WHICH half moved, and a cure that promotes by widening every integer to DT_BIG
# lights arm e rather than passing.
# THE ORACLE IS swipl 9, and every want_out below is CUT FROM IT, never from our output.
# ⛔ RED BEFORE, on the clean origin build 8f7f0d394, m3 AND m4: arm a died at the first goal with
#   error(evaluation_error(int_overflow),context(abs/1,_G0)), arm b with context(+/2,_G0), arm c with
#   context(succ/2,_G0); arms d, e and f were GREEN in that same tree.
# ⛔ ARM g EXISTS BECAUSE THE SUITE DID NOT MOVE. With arms a-f green the Logtalk unbounded family still read
# 82/111, and an unexplained NO-MOVE owes an attribution exactly as much as an unexplained green does. Naming
# its reds found succ_01/02 and plus_01/02/03 failing with type_error(integer, <bignum>): the INPUT side of the
# same two predicates arms c had just cured on the OUTPUT side. THE GREP-DEFINED POPULATION WAS UNDER-
# APPROXIMATED -- defining the class by the lines that RAISE int_overflow found every site that raises and no
# site that refuses, and for succ/2 and plus/3 those are two halves of one predicate. Shipping a-f alone would
# have left both predicates promoting a result they would refuse as an argument.
