# silent-statement-failures-in-scrip-binary-arithmetic-array-and-replace-and-negation-carries-the-wrong-error-number-ceo-1304
# (found by the ceo's audit, CEO-1304; routed to the cfo, CEO-1306; cured by the cfo 2026-09-27).
#
# THE DEFECT: under &ERRLIMIT 0 (the default of both) sbl -bf raises a FATAL runtime error and terminates on x + 1, x - 1,
# x * 2, x / 2 and x ** 2 with x = 'abc', on ARRAY(0 - 1) and on REPLACE with unequally long 2nd and 3rd arguments; SCRIP
# failed the statement silently, took :F, ran on and exited 0, in both modes. -x was raised but numbered 1 where sbl says 010.
# NO SUITE SAW IT: corpus/tests/snobol4/ALL.ref carries no ERROR line, so these programs sit outside every rung suite's
# denominator -- which is why a cure proven on them owes this gate (the ceo's rule of 2026-09-27: a cure proven on a program
# that leaves the denominator owes a gate that keeps it under test).
# THE CURE: the SNOBOL4 lowerer marks its arithmetic nodes strict=2 and bb_binop_arith calls a SNOBOL4-voiced entry family
# (rt_add_sno and its siblings: the same asm fast paths, a slow path that raises SPITBOL's number for the operand that is not
# numeric); Icon's strict=1 and every other frontend's strict=0 are unchanged. ARRAY raises 067 in both dispatch copies and in
# the prototype parser, REPLACE raises 171, negation 010, affirmation 004, and integer division by zero 014 (it said 2).
#
# EACH ARM is a one-statement program run by sbl -bf (the EXPECTED number is read live from the oracle, never typed) and by
# scrip in mode 3 and mode 4: the arm passes when scrip prints 'before' exactly when sbl does, never reaches 'success' or
# 'failure', and names the same error number. A witness sbl does not raise on is a wrong witness and REFUSES rc=2.
# ⛔ A CONSTANT ARM NEVER RUNS (cfo 2026-10-02): sbl -bf evaluates an operation on constant operands WHEN IT COMPILES the
# statement (1 / 0, 9223372036854775807 + 1, 4611686018427387904 * 4, 0.0 ** 0.0, 2.0 ** 2000 are compile-time errors: no
# 'before', the program never runs), and SCRIP does the same since its compile-time pre-evaluation; so 'before' is read from
# sbl's own output, and mode 4 reads the number from the refused compile (M4-COMPILE-REFUSED) where no binary is built.
# CONTROL ARMS: a numeric string operand ('12' + 1) raises nothing and prints 13 in both; ATAN('abc') raises 301 in both.
# ERRLIMIT ARM: with &ERRLIMIT = 5 the same x + 1 is counted, the statement FAILS, and &ERRTYPE reads 1, as sbl gives it.
# FAIL-ONCE, MEASURED: SCRIP_BIN at a scrip built on origin bc96cf1b2 (before the cure) reads 0 of 38 raising arms and the
# &ERRLIMIT arm RED in both modes (&ERRTYPE 0 where sbl gives 1), the two controls green -- the gate measures the cure.
# LANDING 2 (the class, same row): integer overflow 003/034/028 (it WRAPPED silently: the asm fast paths of rt_add/rt_sub/rt_mul
# computed into rdx, the right operand's tag word, before their jo, so the slow path read a corrupted right operand -- a wrong
# answer on every frontend reaching that path), 0 ** 0 018, 2 ** 63 017, (-8) ** 0.5 311, 2.0 ** 2000 266, 1.0E300 squared 263,
# REMDR 165/166/167/312, and INT64_MIN / -1 (a SIGFPE core dump; sbl dumps too). Measured: a build at origin 7ad35d97a (landing
# 1 only) reads 38 of 70 raising arms and both INT64_MIN arms RED in both modes.
# LANDING 3 (the class, same row): negating INT64_MIN raises 011 (it WRAPPED to itself). rt_num_neg gained the voiced entries
# rt_num_neg_sno (011) and rt_num_neg_strict (Icon: the large integer), chosen by bb_unop from the node's strict; strict 0
# still wraps, which is fpc's answer for Pascal. Measured: a build of landing 2 reads that arm RED in both modes.
