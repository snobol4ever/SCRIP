# test_gate_a_blocking_set_death_names_its_killer.sh -- A RUN THAT DIES SAYS WHAT ENDED IT: SIGNAL, ARM REACHED,
# ELAPSED, AND THE SENDER -- OR SAYS IN WORDS THAT THE KILLER LEFT NO RECORD.
# (coo 2026-09-20, row instruments-a-blocking-set-run-is-killed-from-outside-and-no-seat-completed-one-today,
# minted by the ceo on the cfo's CFO-147.)
#
# THE MEASUREMENT THIS EXISTS FOR. 2026-09-20: the cfo's blocking set died at ARM 103 with SIGTERM and again at
# ARM 166 with SIGKILL DESPITE BEING setsid-DETACHED; hq_prolog's died at ARM 6 after THIRTY SECONDS; hq_raku's
# reached 18 and 61. FIVE DEATHS, THREE SEATS, ONE AFTERNOON -- and NOT ONE OF THEM SAID WHAT ENDED IT, so the
# fleet spent the afternoon arguing between a wall-clock ceiling (proposed by the cfo, refuted by hq_prolog's
# thirty seconds, withdrawn by the cfo), an OOM, and another seat's pkill. TEN SEATS SHARE ONE UNIX USER: a
# `pkill -f` keyed on a script name reaches every other seat's run, and the cto signalled eleven pids over
# shared patterns at 01:4x and reported it unprompted. The mechanism is real; what was missing was the RECORD.
#
# ⛔ THE TWO HALVES, BECAUSE ONE MECHANISM CANNOT COVER BOTH:
#   · CATCHABLE signals are trapped by the victim, which prints the signal, the arm it reached, the elapsed and
#     the sender looked up in the kill ledger s4e_kill_mine.sh writes.
#   · SIGKILL CANNOT BE TRAPPED. Nothing inside a victim ever reports it -- so the RUNSTATE makes it legible
#     AFTER the fact: the next run in that root postmortems a state file that never recorded a completion. A
#     design that only handles the signals you can catch handles the ones that do not happen.
#
# THE ARMS
#   (a) a trapped death names SIGNAL, ARM REACHED of N, and ELAPSED, and exits 128+signal
#   (b) an UNLOGGED killer is NAMED AS UNLOGGED -- the instrument refuses to guess a sender it cannot see
#   (c) a kill sent through s4e_kill_mine.sh NAMES ITS SENDER to the victim: seat, root, pid, signal, time
#   (d) SIGKILL: the victim says nothing (it cannot) and THE NEXT RUN POSTMORTEMS IT with pid, arm and verdict
#   (e) a COMPLETED run leaves NO postmortem -- a death report after a clean run is a false alarm, which is the
#       same defect wearing the other sign
#   (f) --explain-only RECORDS NOTHING: it signals nothing, so a ledger line would record an event that did not
#       happen -- a false green in ledger clothing
#   (g) a SHARD CHILD ended by a signal is named "WAS ENDED BY SIG..., its slice is UNMEASURED", never a bare rc
#   (h) THE RUNSTATE IS NEVER UNDER THE CHECKOUT: a state file under out/ or the root would move a watched path
#       on every arm and make the race detector convict every concurrent arm -- one instrument sabotaging its
#       sibling, one directory apart
#   (i) NO RAW BOX-WIDE KILL IN A TRACKED SCRIPT: pkill/killall outside s4e_kill_mine.sh is the reach itself,
#       measured at ZERO executable sites today and pinned there
#   (j) THE LEDGER ROW IS WRITTEN BEFORE THE SIGNAL -- structural and deterministic, because the defect is a
#       RACE and a race arm that happens to win on a quiet box proves nothing. THE DETECTOR of this class.
#   (k) SEVERAL VICTIMS IN ONE KILL all name the same sender and none accuses an unlogged rogue -- end-to-end
#       corroboration that the lookup and the per-pid loop still agree; measured NOT to red on the old order
#       at four victims, so a green here is not evidence the race is closed
# FAIL_ONCE=1 unwires the traps -- (a), (b) and (c) must fail.
# FAIL_ONCE=2 makes the ledger lookup name somebody for any pid -- (b) must fail, because slandering an unlogged
# killer is worse than admitting the record is missing.
