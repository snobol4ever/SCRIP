# WHAT THIS GATE HOLDS (hq_collector 2026-10-09, on the cto's ask for the assertz-reclaim row
# prolog-the-code-assertz-generates-is-reclaimed-once-nothing-can-reference-it-lon-2026-09-27, ORDER (1)):
# int rt_gc_frames_visit(fn, a) in gc_heap.c calls fn once per live emitted frame, with its map and base, over every
# stack segment -- the running one entered from C through the unwinder, each parked co-expression from its park rbp --
# by the ARCH-GC section 13.4 chain walk, and returns 0 WITHOUT calling fn when any segment's chain stops short of ROOT
# (the running main stack) or of its own top (a co-expression), so a caller deciding liveness never reads a partial
# list. First cut: no choice links.
#
# THE INSTRUMENT: under SCRIP_GC_CHAIN_CHECK=3 every collection calls the visitor before it walks and compares the
# visitor's frame count and an order-sensitive sum of (base ^ map) with the frames the collector's own chain walk
# finds in the same collection; the [CHAIN-WALK] SUMMARY line carries "visitor: same= differ= refused=".
#
# ARMS: (1) per witness, mode 3 and mode 4: the summary is printed, same > 0, differ = 0, and refused is no larger
# than the collector's own short stops (nosite + frameless + unknown-depth + cycle + no-link + no-rise), i.e. the
# visitor refuses only where the collector's chain itself stopped short; (2) THE REFUSAL: on the SIG-shim witness, whose
# run-time fragment polls are frameless today, every collection with a frameless running chain is refused, never
# handed back as a shorter list (when the fragment class lands and frameless reads 0 the arm says there was nothing to
# refuse); (3) the visitor and its callback type are declared once, in gc_heap.h; (4) THE COROUTINE START (the ceo's
# order of 2026-10-09: rt_genp_spine_enter_n2 is the sanctioned coroutine start of a generator's co-expression thread, so
# the collector names it): on hb_coexpr_genp_scan every suspended body's chain that links to the stub's gamma or omega
# label (published in rt_genp_n2_conts, a read-only record, so no text symbol splits the stub) ends there as the segment's start, so nosite reads 0, coroutine-start > 0 and the visitor refuses nothing.
# (5) THE BALL IN CATCH (the cto's controls, 2026-10-09): a goal meta-called by catch through bb_call_value.cpp's
# pl_proto arm whose is/2 or unify cold road raises a ball polls inside the goal; the arm's gamma landing was no site, so
# the chain stopped there (nosite 6 of 53 and 30 of 221, both modes, predating the occurs-check landing). The landing is
# a site since this arm; both witnesses read whole and the visitor refuses nothing.
# Measured at landing over all 107 gc_witnesses, both modes, 64 KB, stress 1: same=733261 differ=0 refused=28 (the 28
# are hb_coexpr_genp_scan 13, hb_shim_rt_names 14, hb_cv_spine_plain_redo 1 -- the open nosite/frameless classes).
