# test_gate_rtx_killswitch_sets.sh — KILL-SWITCH BYTE-IDENTITY, N>=4 PER ARM, HASH *SETS*, **BOTH MODES**.
#
# Minted s219 (2026-07-30).  Implements the correction ARCH-SNOBOL4-RTX.md §7 step 3
# received at s217 and which had no executable form until now.
# m4 ARM ADDED s222 (2026-07-30) — see "WHY THE m4 ARM IS NOT OPTIONAL" below.
#
# WHAT WAS WRONG WITH THE GATE AS PRACTICED: it ran ONE run per arm per program and
# compared the two hashes.  The suite contains at least one program that is
# NON-DETERMINISTIC RUN-TO-RUN ON THE PURE-C PATH (160_pat_alt_inner_gen_resume:
# three distinct hashes in four gate-OFF runs, measured s217).  Against such a
# program a single-run comparison reports MOVER or IDENTICAL BY COIN FLIP, so a
# recorded pass is luck rather than evidence — and the failure mode is severe in
# both directions: a later session either reverts a correct port and hunts a bug
# that does not exist, or ships a real leak because the dice fell the other way.
#
# THE DISCRIMINATION IS FREE: gate OFF *is* the C fallback, so instability that is
# visible with the gate OFF cannot have been caused by the asm.  Hence three
# verdicts, not two:
#   IDENTICAL   ON set == OFF set, both singletons  -> real evidence
#   QUARANTINE  either arm produced >1 distinct hash -> unfalsifiable HERE, and
#               that is a fact about the PROGRAM, reported, never silently skipped
#   MOVER       both arms stable and the hashes differ -> the port changed behaviour
#   SKIP        (m4 only) the program does not compile/link -> not evidence either way
#
# A QUARANTINE verdict is NOT a pass and NOT a failure; it is the third thing, and
# printing it is the entire point (same reason 0(f) prints COMMITS rather than a
# pass/fail).  Do NOT "fix" a quarantined program by excluding it wholesale: 160
# both fails in both modes AND is non-deterministic, and a blanket exclusion fuses
# two independent facts.
#
# ⛔ WHY THE m4 ARM IS NOT OPTIONAL (s222).  ARCH §7 step 3 has mandated "BOTH modes"
# since s217; this script shipped with `--run` only, so s219/s220/s221 each recorded a
# suite-wide PASS that was m3-ONLY while the contract read "both".  That gap matters far
# more than it looks, because mode 4 is exactly where this codebase's worst silent
# failure class lives: pattern_match.c:737 records that giving g_cap_gen hidden
# visibility cost 173/316 mode-4 LINK failures while mode 3 stayed green — mode 3 bakes
# the address in-process and is structurally incapable of seeing it.  Any rung that
# touches templates or symbol visibility (RTX-11 collapses call sites in
# bb_match_release; every static->hidden promotion a port needs) is precisely the class
# whose signature failure an m3-only gate cannot detect.  ⇒ DEFAULT IS NOW `both`.
# Pass `m3` explicitly to reproduce the s219-s221 historical numbers.
#
# ⭐ WHY THE m4 ARM IS CHEAP, MEASURED NOT ASSUMED (s222): `--compile` output is
# BYTE-IDENTICAL at gate ON and OFF, because RTX_GATE is a runtime `.byte` test inside
# the .so (rtx_abi.inc:83) whose value is set by the .so's OWN constructor
# (rtx_init.c:24) — and an m4 binary links that same .so, so the env toggle reaches it
# identically.  Verified by cmp on a probe program before this arm was written.  So we
# compile ONCE per program and toggle only the RUNS.
#
# ⚠ STDIN IS /dev/null IN BOTH ARMS AND THAT IS DELIBERATE (s220 fix, RULES.md line 80).
# A program starved of input may fail — irrelevant here, because this gate compares ON
# vs OFF of the SAME program under the SAME stdin.  Identity is still the question.
# Feeding real `.input` files would be more faithful but would silently invalidate the
# s219-s221 m3 baselines, so it is NOT done here; that is its own rung.
