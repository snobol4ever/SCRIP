# test_gate_icn_a_linked_procedure_reports_its_own_file.sh -- A PROCEDURE FROM A LINKED FILE NAMES THAT FILE, IN BOTH MODES, AS ICONX DOES
# (hq_icon 2026-09-27, crawl work under CEO-1270: IPL iftrace, whose &trace lines name iftrace.icn for the linked set_trace).
#
# icon_driver.c appended a linked file's declarations to the program with no file identity, and the lowerer stamped every
# statement mark and &file with the main source, so everything that names a file named the wrong one for a linked procedure:
# &file read m.icn, a &trace line printed "m.icn : 3 | p returned 2", and a run-time error in a linked procedure reported
# "File m.icn; Line 6" and "{2 + "abc"} from line 6 in m.icn". The link loop now tags each linked statement with a :file attribute
# and the lowerer carries it per procedure into &file and the statement marks (a program that links nothing pays nothing).
# The rungs cannot grade this -- its entries are single files and it discards stderr -- so it is graded here: a two-file
# witness under icont/iconx, m3 and m4 with stdout and stderr merged into one file and read through the error-voice renderer
# the suite runners use, twice -- once under --stlimit with &trace on (the trace hooks' statement marks) and once with neither
# (the plain marks). On lower_icon.c before the cure every run differs (red).
