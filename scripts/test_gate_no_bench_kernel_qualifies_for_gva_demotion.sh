# test_gate_no_bench_kernel_qualifies_for_gva_demotion.sh -- ⭐ THE GVA-DEMOTION CLIFF, ASSERTED INSTEAD OF
# LEFT AS A COINCIDENCE (hq_P 2026-09-13; SPEED lane, CONCERN 2 under NONET. Route ruled by cfo, who owns
# the trigger -- see THE OBSERVABLE below; their canary is SCRIP 5a6aa3461, the cure bbb77e2a1).
#
# ⛔ WHAT THIS GUARDS, AND WHY NOTHING ELSE CAN. rung22 made an ACCESS trace fire on a plain global read by
# DEMOTING the GVA fast path at compile time: a SNOBOL4 program holding a TRACE call whose type argument is
# not a literal provably non-ACCESS has its eligible-global count set to zero, and every global read in it
# goes the slow way. Measured cost on this box: 1.82x-2.15x. ⛔⛔ A DEMOTED PROGRAM IS STILL *CORRECT*, so
# no board, ref, oracle diff or correctness gate in this tree can ever report that it got slower. A
# benchmark grid would report it as an honest reading of a program that had quietly fallen down a hole.
#
# ⭐ THIS GATE AND cfo's CANARY POINT IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS AND THAT IS THE DESIGN. Their four witnesses
# fail if the demotion ever stops FIRING. They cannot detect A NEW PROGRAM FALLING ONTO THE CLIFF -- their
# green stays green, correctly, on the day it happens. That second absence is this gate's only job.
# Measured when the cure landed: the qualifying set is EMPTY across the benchmark tree -- every TRACE call
# there is one of cfo's own non-qualifying controls. THE REASON NOBODY PAYS IS THE REASON NOBODY WOULD
# NOTICE, so the empty set is asserted here rather than left to hold by luck.
#
# ⭐⭐ THE OBSERVABLE IS THE EMITTED ISLAND, NOT A COPY OF THE PREDICATE (cfo's ruling, 2026-09-13, and it
# is a better design than the one this gate was first written with). A first cut mirrored
# gva_trace_type_provably_non_access()'s two spellings and tripwired them. That is still TWO independent
# implementations of one rule -- it only makes the drift loud. Instead this gate compiles the kernel and
# asserts `__gva_names` is PRESENT in the .s (emitted at src/driver/scrip.c:1530, gated on n_gva > 0). That
# reads THE TRIGGER'S OUTPUT, so it cannot disagree with the trigger by construction: if the predicate ever
# widens to a spelling this gate does not know, the island vanishes and this gate goes RED on that kernel,
# which is exactly the alarm wanted. Both guards then share ONE ground truth and ask opposite questions.
#
# ⛔ THE FALSE-GREEN TRAP, cfo's, in this gate's direction: a PRESENCE check passes on a kernel that has no
# eligible globals at all and so never had an island to lose. Absence is therefore never a silent pass --
# it is resolved against a TWIN (the same source with its TRACE calls removed). Twin has an island and the
# original does not => DEMOTED, rc=1. Neither has one => the kernel has no eligible globals, the arm is
# VACUOUS, rc=2. A gate that cannot measure must never print what a clean one prints.
