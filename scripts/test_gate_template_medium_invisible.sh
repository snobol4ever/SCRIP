# FACT RULE "ONE MEDIUM, INVISIBLE": a BB template never hand-encodes an instruction as raw bytes nor
# branches on the medium for an instruction with a RAW, unsanctioned spelling. Forbidden in
# src/templates/{bb,xa}/*.cpp (comments stripped):
#   raw-byte producers: x86_Lrec, x86_Jrec, x86_Drec, x86_b1(, x86_b2(, x86_b3(, bytes(, u8(, u32le, u64le
#   RAW medium-branch scatter: IF(MEDIUM_BINARY, IF(MEDIUM_TEXT, IF(MEDIUM_MACRO_DEF
# ⭐ RE-SCOPED under RULES.md § MODES MAY DIVERGE (Lon 2026-08-28, row `gate-mode-arms-rescope`): the old
# m3≡m4 byte-identity law is LIFTED and a DELIBERATE per-mode template arm is now legal -- but only
# through ONE sanctioned, greppable spelling: IF_M3(...)/IF_M4(...) (src/emitter/emit.h, thin wrappers
# over IF(MEDIUM_BINARY,...)/IF(MEDIUM_TEXT,...) living beside IF() itself -- "encapsulate mode 3 and
# mode 4 changes within an upper set of helpers", Lon, same sitting). The raw IF(MEDIUM_*,...) forms
# above stay forbidden -- an idea is sanctioned or it is scatter, never both spellings for the same one.
# x86_asm.h is the encoder impl (exempt). Historic prey that SURVIVES the re-scope, unconditionally, in
# PART 2 and PART 3 below: ACCIDENTAL divergence (any raw MEDIUM_* token in bb_*.cpp -- ratchet, ceiling
# 0) and a SANCTIONED arm that reaches into port instrumentation (a mode arm may change INSTRUCTIONS,
# never a port's x86_deflabel canary/ZDP/ZLS2 hook -- RULES.md: "port-seam protection stays absolute").
# PART 1 (raw-byte producers + raw scatter) is an informational WIP baseline; --strict enforces zero.

# =====================================================================================================
# BOTH-MEDIUM RATCHET (RULES.md "NO MEDIUM_* IN TEMPLATES") — added s169 (seat1, queue row gates-dead-paths).
# RULES.md carried the ratchet as a TYPED NUMBER (29) next to a DIFFERENT command (`grep -rn 'MEDIUM_'
# src/templates/bb/bb_*.cpp`, which yields 38). A ratchet whose number and whose command disagree cannot be
# enforced: the next seat runs the documented command, sees 38, and reads a 9-site regression that never
# happened. The 29 is the GUARD-SITE count -- `if (MEDIUM_` plus `IF(MEDIUM_` -- and guard sites are what
# the rule actually forbids ("any function gating output on MEDIUM_TEXT/MEDIUM_BINARY is a violation").
# That is the number pinned here, computed, never typed. Retire the sites via queue row `medium-retire`.
# ⛔ BLIND SPOT CLOSED s170 (seat1, row `medium-retire`). The s169 ratchet counted `if (MEDIUM_` + `IF(MEDIUM_`
# because those were the shapes the census had seen. They are NOT the only way to gate on the medium: two live
# sites in bb_call_proc_staged spelled it as a CONDITIONAL EXPRESSION -- `(MEDIUM_BINARY && cell ? A : B)` --
# and the guard regex walked straight past both, so the true count was 31, not 29. A ratchet that enumerates
# SPELLINGS will always be one syntax behind the code. This one now counts every MEDIUM_* token that survives
# comment-stripping, which is spelling-independent and is what the rule actually says ("Zero MEDIUM_* in any
# bb_*.cpp"); the guard-site number is kept beside it as a breakdown, never as the gate.
# ⛔ RATCHET CLOSED s172 (seat6, row `ab-cell-hoist`): 3 -> 0.  The last three were all in bb_define.cpp and all one class -- the AB fn-cell
# store (g_ab_fn_cells + bb_ab_cell_addr) is C-side LIVE-IMAGE state that only a BINARY image has, so the template had to ask the
# medium whether a cell existed.  The store was hoisted to src/emitter/emit.cpp (the file that owns g_medium) and bb_ab_cell_addr now
# answers NULL for TEXT; all three sites became tests of the returned POINTER.  Per-medium byte-identity measured: 0 movers / 527
# comparable .s and 0 movers / 575 mode-3 runs.  THE CEILING IS NOW ZERO AND MUST STAY ZERO -- this is no longer a known-red ratchet
# but a live invariant: a single MEDIUM_* token in any bb_*.cpp fails this gate.
# ⭐ RE-SCOPED, not re-measured, 2026-08-28 (row gate-mode-arms-rescope): the ceiling and the scanning logic
# below are UNCHANGED -- a raw MEDIUM_* token is still an unconditional failure. What changed is that a
# DELIBERATE arm now has a legal escape (IF_M3/IF_M4, PART 1 above) that is INVISIBLE to this regex by
# construction, since its own spelling contains no "MEDIUM_" substring -- that is what makes it the
# sanctioned door rather than a second violation class. § SELF-TEST proves this both ways rather than
# just asserting it.

# RULES.md § MODES MAY DIVERGE: "port-seam protection (x86_deflabel hooks) stays absolute ... an arm may
# change instructions, never a port's instrumentation contract." A mode arm may emit whatever
# INSTRUCTIONS it likes inside IF_M3(...)/IF_M4(...); it may never itself DEFINE A PORT there
# (x86_deflabel/x86_alpha/x86_beta*, or a raw x86("label", _.lbl_*) port-label bypass) -- ports stay
# unconditional so the canary/ZDP/ZLS2 hook fires identically regardless of mode. Ceiling 0, absolute --
# no --strict gate, same standing as the ratchet above. KNOWN LIMITATION, stated plainly rather than
# overclaimed: this is a paren-depth balance over the token stream, not a real C++ parse -- an unbalanced
# string literal or macro-generated paren inside an IF_M3/IF_M4 argument can confuse the boundary. A lint,
# not a proof, the same honesty this file already keeps about the guard-site regex above.
