# no longer exists -- Lon's one-flat-suite ruling absorbed it into the Snocone master (ALL.sc/ALL.ref/
# ALL.csv) as the "parser" family, 67 entries (family=parser, kind=block, modes=ast), origin names
# parser__<old-name> preserving the old per-file names. Verified by direct extraction before wiring this
# in: parser__arith_add materializes to "x = 1 + 2;" / "(STMT :subj (TT_ASSIGN ...))" -- exactly the
# .sc-source-in / AST-dump-out shape this script already expects, not a different population wearing the
# same name. Materialize into an ephemeral scratch dir (mktemp + EXIT trap, same discipline as this row's
# other extraction fixes) rather than a persistent one -- this script runs standalone/rarely, not
# repeatedly in one board session, so there is nothing to gain from reuse and a stale extraction across a
# corpus update is a worse failure mode than a few seconds of re-extraction.

# ⛔⭐ ASSERT NON-TRIVIAL BEFORE TRUSTING THE VERDICT (same Law-4 principle as the sr1-lower-gate row this
# sitting also handled): checked live, not assumed from memory. If literally every failure got EMPTY
# output, this is not $FAIL independent parser defects, it is one shared mechanism failing identically --
# characterized this session (seat06 2026-09-04): `scrip --run` with N positional source files only
# honors the FIRST one (confirmed by swapping file order: global.sc-first dumps exactly global.sc's own
# 56 statements and parser_snocone.sc's content, including its driver, never appears; reversed, the
# opposite happens), so parser_snocone.sc (last in this script's 15-file list) and its driver never run.
# grepping scripts/*.sh found ZERO other callers relying on this multi-file-positional pattern -- not a
# tree-wide regression, just this one script's assumption, apparently never actually exercised end-to-end.
# Whether the real fix is an INCLUDE-based single-file composition or a scrip driver change is its own
# investigation, out of this row's scope (same treatment as test_emit_diff_invariant_check.sh elsewhere
# in this row) -- REFUSE with the diagnosis rather than print a false per-fixture board.
