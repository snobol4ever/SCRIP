# test_gate_raku_predeclared_names_agree_with_rakudo.sh -- A NAME THE RUNTIME PROVIDES IS RESOLVED BY THE LOWERER, AND A USER'S OWN DEFINITION STILL WINS
# (row raku-every-suite-to-100-under-nonet-ceo-1266, Lon 2026-09-25: "use IPC sync-step monitor to crawl the test suites to 100%"; ceo CEO-1479).
#
# THE DEFECT, measured over Roast (1381 files that parse) with scrip --compile and nothing executed: only 629 compile, and 680 of the 746 refusals are
# ONE guard, graph_native_emittable_mode in src/driver/scrip.c ("variable X is read but never assigned and is not a parameter"). A large family of its names
# is not a user variable at all: Raku PREDECLARES them -- the Order enums Less Same More, Empty, the zero-argument terms now, time and rand, the Unicode
# constants pi tau and infinity, the dynamic variables $*PID $*PROGRAM $*PROGRAM-NAME $*CWD $*HOME $*TMPDIR $*USER $*EXECUTABLE %*ENV @*ARGS, $?FILE, and a
# bare die -- and nothing resolved them. THE CURE is one table in lower_raku.c (rk_predeclared) that lowers each to a call of the runtime provider __rk_pre(name)
# (by_name_dispatch.c rk_pre_value), NEVER over a class of that name, a user sub of that name or a name the table does not list; and a bareword that names a
# declared sub is a call with no arguments (Rakudo: `sub foo { 5 }; say foo` prints 5), which is what lets a user's own now, time or rand win.
# Measured after it: 699 of 1381 compile (70 files past the guard).
#
# THE WITNESSES, each graded in m3 (--run) and m4 (--compile + link) against a ref cut by Rakudo (/usr/bin/raku): names prints a boolean, a type or a constant
# for every provided name (so it is deterministic on any machine); shadow proves a user sub named now, time or rand, a user sub called as a bareword, one
# declared after its call, and a user-declared dynamic variable all keep their own meaning.
# FAILED ONCE, measured on SCRIP 523e3ce56: both witnesses are refused by the guard ([SMX] variable ... is read but never assigned) in both modes.
# NOT HERE, each its own mechanism with its own row: the OBJECT-valued names ($*OUT $*ERR $*IN need IO::Handle, $*KERNEL $*DISTRO $*VM need system objects,
# $/ and $! need a typed Match and exception objects, @_ and WhateverCode).
#
# EXIT: 0 both witnesses match in both modes; 1 a mismatch or a crash on a witness; 2 REFUSED (stale binary, no gcc).
# Usage: bash scripts/test_gate_raku_predeclared_names_agree_with_rakudo.sh   (~3s, no oracle at run time, no network)
