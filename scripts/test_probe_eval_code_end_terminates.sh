# test_probe_eval_code_end_terminates.sh -- ACCEPTANCE INSTRUMENT for task eval-code-end-terminates-m4.
#
# WHAT THIS CHECKS. A CODE() fragment whose OWN internal Goto is `:(END)` (the fragment terminates the
# whole program from inside its own flow, rather than transferring back to a label in the enclosing
# program) SIGSEGVs -- confirmed 2026-08-29 to crash in BOTH modes (rc=139), not "m4 only" as the
# original 2026-08-22 brief recorded -- the bug's own signature has drifted since it was minted.
# Live-oracle-verified correct behaviour (corpus/tests/snobol4/probe/eval.ref, entries 20-21): print
# exactly "before" then "in fragment", then terminate CLEANLY (rc=0) -- nothing more, no crash.
#
# Witnesses (both currently XFAIL entries 20/21 of corpus/tests/snobol4/probe/eval.sno):
#   ev_code_end_terminates  -- fragment entered via the direct code-object goto `:<C>`
#   ev_code_end_label_ctl   -- fragment entered via an ORDINARY label goto `:(INSIDE)` instead --
#                              proves the direct-goto grammar is not itself in the picture; the shared
#                              ingredient is only "the fragment's own internal goto target is END".
# Passing control (must stay green, not graded here since it already passes both modes today):
#   ev_code_back_ctl        -- identical shape but the fragment's own internal goto is `:(DONE)`, a
#                              real label back in the enclosing program -- proves the defect is
#                              specifically about the fragment's own END-transition, not CODE()/goto
#                              generally.
#
# ⛔ THIS TEST CURRENTLY FAILS BY DESIGN -- the underlying bug is NOT fixed as of this writing (see
# FINDING-2026-08-29-seat01-eval-code-end-terminates-mechanism-named-not-yet-fixed.md for the traced
# mechanism). It exists so a future fix has a real, computable, currently-red acceptance bar instead of
# the prose-only placeholder this row's DONE-WHEN used to be.
#
# USAGE: bash scripts/test_probe_eval_code_end_terminates.sh
# EXIT:  0 = both witnesses print exactly "before"/"in fragment" and exit rc=0, BOTH modes (the bug is
#            fixed) | 1 = still crashing or wrong output | 2 = REFUSED, could not measure.
