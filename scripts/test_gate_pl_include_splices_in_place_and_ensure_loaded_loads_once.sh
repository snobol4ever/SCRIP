# test_gate_pl_include_splices_in_place_and_ensure_loaded_loads_once.sh -- :- include(F) IS TEXTUAL INCLUSION AT THE DIRECTIVE'S PLACE (ISO 7.4.2.7) AND
# :- ensure_loaded(F) LOADS F ONCE (ISO 7.4.2.8); an initialization goal inside an included file runs in load order (hq_prolog 2026-09-25, CEO-1270).
# THE DEFECT. SCRIP dropped both directives: the lowering lists ensure_loaded among ignored declarations and include had no handling at all, so a
# file's clauses never arrived (Logtalk directives include_1, ensure_loaded_1: existence_error(procedure, a/1)). THE CURE: prolog_parse.c parses an
# include's file in place, before clauses are grouped by predicate, so a(1) a(2) from two included files and the including file's own a(3) are one
# predicate in textual order -- a splice after grouping (tried first) kept only one of the groups; prolog_driver.c's load-time consult splice now
# takes ensure_loaded too, which already loads a path once. THE EXPECTATIONS ARE swipl's (2026-09-25); gprolog agrees on the include line and
# has no ensure_loaded/1. RED BEFORE on origin 6ac5caa1b, m3 AND m4: [3], then existence_error for e/1 (rc=2).
