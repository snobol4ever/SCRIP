# convention-depth-tracked, the row that actually cured it) was overwritten TWICE by later re-parks recording
# a different hypothesis; when the true blocker landed DONE nothing was left naming it, so the row could not
# self-clear and eight seats released it unworked.
# TWO ARMS against a THROWAWAY postoffice under mktemp -- never the live one -- each run against the live
# s4e_msg.sh and (arm A only -- arm B's refuse-check pre-dates this row, hq_B mint) against a mutated copy
# with the additive-merge cure removed (FAIL-ONCE, INSTRUMENT LAWS fifth batch):
#   (A) park X BLOCKED-ON:B1, then park X BLOCKED-ON:B2 -> column reads BLOCKED-ON:B1+B2 (merged, not
#       overwritten); mark B1 DONE; `next` reconsiders X -> self-heals and locks/serves it (no longer stuck
#       BLOCKED-ON anything -- the state column left the BLOCKED-ON:/PARKED-AWAITING: family entirely).
#   (B) park Y BLOCKED-ON:<topic absent from QUEUE.tsv and QUEUE.done.tsv> -> REFUSED rc=2, column unchanged.
# EXIT 0 both arms hold on the live script AND arm (A) goes red on the mutated copy; 1 otherwise; 2 REFUSED.
