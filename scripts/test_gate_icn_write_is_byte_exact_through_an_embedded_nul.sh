# test_gate_icn_write_is_byte_exact_through_an_embedded_nul.sh -- write() AND writes() EMIT EVERY BYTE OF A
# STRING, INCLUDING THE BYTES AFTER AN EMBEDDED NUL (cfo 2026-09-12, found by the shootout mandelbrot kernel).
#
# THE DEFECT, MEASURED: `s := "a" || char(0) || "b" || char(0) || "c"; writes(s)` printed ONE byte under us and
# five under iconx, in both modes, while `*s` said 5 and image(s) said "a\x00b\x00c" -- the string was intact
# and only the stdout writer was NUL-terminated (VARVAL + fputs). The file-destination branch of the same
# builtin had been length-aware since 7fbb787eb (iobig); stdout and stderr were not. A P4 PBM (mandelbrot at
# w=64) lost 190 of its 512 pixel bytes to it and the diff looked like a wrong computation.
#
# THE REF IS CUT FROM THE ORACLE AT RUN TIME, never pinned by hand, and compared with cmp (byte compare) --
# a `$(...)` capture eats NUL bytes and trailing newlines and would grade this very class wrong (CFO-52 trap 2).
# ⭐ SELF-TEST SEAM: GATE_FAIL_ONCE=1 truncates our m3 stream at its first NUL so the gate is seen to say no.
