# test_gate_icn_rundir_contract.sh -- A WITNESS THAT READS ITS ENVIRONMENT IS GRADED WITH THAT ENVIRONMENT
# PRESENT, AND THE GATE PROVES THE ENVIRONMENT IS WHAT MADE THE DIFFERENCE.
#
# ⛔⛔ THE DEFECT THIS GATE STANDS OVER (hq_I, FINDING-2026-09-10; hq_P, CEO-532). rung36_jcon_recent lists
# its own working directory, reads recent.dat from it, and prints getenv("JCONT"). Graded with none of that
# present it printed 313 orderly lines ending in `can't open recent.dat` -- and the ORACLE, starved the same
# way, printed the same 313 lines. The two agreed, so the witness read PASS. ⭐ AGREEING ABOUT WHERE YOU BOTH
# GAVE UP IS NOT AGREEMENT ABOUT THE PROGRAM: the starved output is non-empty, well-formed, byte-identical
# across runs and stable under every check a runner normally makes. Fed, the program answers 443 lines and
# the extra 130 turned out to contain a real open(<directory>) defect. A starved grading is worth exactly the
# width of the question that survived the starvation.
#
# ⛔ SO A GATE THAT ONLY ASKED "does SCRIP match the ref" WOULD HAVE PASSED THROUGHOUT. That is why ARM 3
# exists and why it is not optional: it re-runs each witness with its contract DELIBERATELY SUPPRESSED and
# REQUIRES the answer to change. An instrument that cannot fail prints the same string as one that passed.
#
# THE FOUR ARMS:
#   1 THE CONTRACTED ANSWER MEETS ITS PINNED FLOOR. ⛔ THIS ARM REPLACED A TAUTOLOGY, and the replacement is
#     the lesson: the first version of ARM 1 compared NAME.fixtures/ against its own copy in the rundir, so
#     DELETING a fixture from the declaration made the declaration smaller and ARM 1 passed. My own negative
#     test (remove recogn.dat) then showed something worse -- ⛔ ARM 2 IS STARVATION-BLIND BY CONSTRUCTION:
#     SCRIP and the oracle both starved to 442 lines and AGREED, exactly the class this gate exists over. So
#     no amount of oracle agreement can guard the rundir; only an absolute floor on the ANSWER can, and it is
#     the one arm that still bites on a row whose ref is disputed. A floor that RISES prints a re-pin line
#     (MASTER_ENTRY_FLOOR's discipline); only a fixture actually retired may lower one, in the commit that
#     retires it. The fixture/rundir copy check is kept underneath it, as a staging assert, not as the guard.
#   2 SCRIP == THE LIVE ARIZONA ORACLE, byte for byte, in that rundir. ⭐ The oracle is COMPILED FROM THE
#     WITNESS'S OWN SOURCE EVERY RUN, never a checked-in ref, so an oracle/SCRIP difference cannot be a
#     ref-drift artifact. Its binary is kept OUTSIDE the rundir -- inside, it would be a directory entry on
#     one side only, which is the confound wearing a smaller face (hq_I's one-directory-same-inode rule).
#   3 KILLSWITCH -- with the contract suppressed the answer MUST differ. Negative-tested, see below.
#   4 REF AGREEMENT -- the checked-in .expected must equal the contracted oracle answer, EXCEPT for the
#     rows pinned in REF_DISPUTED below, which must still DIFFER. A pinned row that starts matching is an
#     XPASS and FAILS, so a ref cure can never land and leave a stale pin behind.
#
# ⛔ REFUSES (rc=2) RATHER THAN SKIPPING: no scrip, no icont, no corpus, an unstageable fixture, or a witness
# whose oracle will not compile is UNPROVEN, never a pass.
#
# NEGATIVE TESTS ACTUALLY RUN (hq_P 2026-09-10, each restored and the gate reconfirmed green afterwards).
# Recorded with the arm that ACTUALLY fired, because two of them fired somewhere other than where I first
# wrote down, and a negative-test record that names the wrong arm is worth less than none:
#   remove recogn.dat from rung36_jcon_recent.fixtures/  -> ARM1 rc=1 (oracle 442 < floor 443)
#   remove io.std from rung36_jcon_io.fixtures/          -> ARM1 rc=1 (oracle 133 < floor 135) ⭐ the
#       REF-DISPUTED row, where ARM4 is muted -- so this is the case that proves ARM1 is not redundant
#   set JCONT=WRONG in rung36_jcon_recent.env            -> ARM4 rc=1. ⛔ ARM2 stayed GREEN, correctly:
#       both arms read the same wrong environment and agreed about it. That is the whole thesis of this
#       gate reproduced on demand, and it is why ARM2 is never allowed to be the only guard.
#   a line that is not VAR=value in the .env             -> rc=2 REFUSED (was rc=1 before the reader's
#       glob was anchored -- it had accepted `this is not VAR=value` as a variable named `this is not VAR`)
#   an argv sidecar naming another program               -> rc=2 REFUSED by ipl_argv_read's own name check
#   a contracted witness with no contract_floor() line   -> rc=2 REFUSED
#
# EXIT: 0 = every arm green.  1 = a regression.  2 = REFUSED/UNPROVEN.

# ⛔ ROWS WHOSE CHECKED-IN .expected DISAGREES WITH THE ARIZONA ORACLE AND IS KNOWN TO COME FROM A DIFFERENT
# ONE. ⭐⭐ EMPTY AS OF 2026-09-10, AND THE ENTRY THAT EMPTIED IT IS THE ARGUMENT FOR THE MECHANISM: this held
# `rung36_jcon_io` because its .expected was a BYTE-FOR-BYTE COPY OF JCON'S OWN io.std -- a JVM-jcon
# reference, not an icont/iconx cut -- disagreeing on 9 `nonseq:` rows where jcon FAILS a seek past
# end-of-file and prints '-' while Arizona SUCCEEDS and prints '?'. SCRIP matched Arizona on every one.
# ⭐ THE PIN WAS AN XPASS TRAP, NOT A MUTE, AND THAT IS WHY IT CLOSED ITSELF: the coo re-cut the ref from
# Arizona icont (corpus 77a835525, confirmed by cutting it independently in their own directory and getting
# a byte-identical result), and ARM 4 went RED THE NEXT TIME THIS GATE RAN -- "XPASS: pinned in REF_DISPUTED
# but the ref now MATCHES the Arizona oracle" -- which is what removed the row. ⛔ A tolerated red recorded
# as a MUTE would have gone on being tolerated after the thing it tolerated was fixed, silently, forever;
# every entry here must keep that property.
# ⚠️ THE COUNT WAS 10 HERE UNTIL 2026-09-10 AND IT IS 9 (hq_P, measured; the ceo's CEO-534 carried the 10 too,
# and corrected it in CEO-536). It came from ARM 4's own REPORTED line, which counted diff's `<` AND `>` and
# called the total "lines" -- on two files of equal length that is exactly twice the truth. ⭐ A GATE THAT
# MISREPORTS ITS OWN NUMBER TEACHES THAT NUMBER TO EVERY READER DOWNSTREAM: the 10 reached a gate header, a
# FINDING and a ceo ruling before anyone re-derived it. The label now says "ref line(s) disagree" and counts
# `<` alone. Kept here after the row itself is gone, because the lesson outlives the dispute.

# ⭐ THE ANSWER FLOOR, one row per contracted witness: the number of lines the LIVE ORACLE produces in the

# see ARM 1 in the header. Measured hq_P 2026-09-10, icont/iconx v9.5.25a, three runs each byte-identical.
# ⭐ SIX ROWS ADDED 2026-09-10 (hq_P, on the coo's routed finding). They are not new witnesses -- they were
# always here, carrying a stdin sidecar, and this gate COULD NOT SEE THEM: it discovers its population with
# icn_rundir_declares(), which tested argv/fixtures/env and not stdin, so the contract's own gate graded 2 of
# the 8 contracted witnesses. ⛔ All six measured with the LIVE ORACLE in the fully-armed rundir, by the same
# method this gate uses; the two pre-existing pins (io 135, recent 443) were RE-DERIVED by that method first
# and reproduced exactly, which is what makes the six trustworthy rather than merely plausible. SCRIP agrees
# with the oracle on all eight at the tree that pinned them.

# ---- ARM 5: THE UNDECLARED-STDIN SWEEP -- the OTHER half of the contract, and the silent one
# ⛔ THE DEFECT THIS ARM STANDS OVER (coo -> hq_P, 2026-09-10, out of the rung36_jcon_io ref cut): the entry
# could not reproduce its own ref. io.icn reads stdin SIX different ways at lines 16-21 and eats eight lines
# doing it; the entry declared argv and fixtures and stayed SILENT about the one input that decides eight of
# its lines, and icn_rundir_stdin hands back /dev/null when no sidecar exists. So the witness graded STARVED,
# produced a shorter but perfectly orderly answer, and read as A COMPILER DEFECT. ⭐ Every other arm above
# grades witnesses that DO declare a contract; nothing anywhere graded the ones that should and do not, which
# is the harder direction because the evidence of the omission IS the omission.
# ⛔⭐ THE FIRST CUT OF THIS ARM COMPARED THE ORACLE STARVED VS FED SOME GENERIC BYTES, AND IT WAS NEARLY
# VACUOUS -- proven so by its own fail-once test, which is the only reason it is not still here. Hiding
# rung36_jcon_geddump's sidecar (a witness whose oracle answers 313 lines fed and 0 starved) did NOT red it:
# geddump rejects arbitrary bytes exactly as it rejects EOF, so fed and starved agreed and it passed. ⭐ THE
# SAME BLIND SPOT HAD ALREADY MISREAD geddump AND profsum ONCE, in the census that motivated this arm. An
# instrument whose failures and successes look alike is worth less than no instrument, because it also
# reports a number.
# ✅ THE DISCRIMINATOR IS NOW "DOES IT READ STDIN AT ALL", NOT "DOES ITS ANSWER CHANGE", and it is
# program-agnostic: stdin is a FIFO HELD OPEN BY A WRITER THAT SENDS NOTHING. A program that reads stdin
# BLOCKS on it (timeout, rc 124); one that never reads runs to completion untouched. No knowledge of any
# witness's input format is needed, which is exactly what the byte-feeding version required and could not have.
# ⛔ WITH A CONTROL ARM, because "it blocked" has a second explanation: the same program is also run against
# /dev/null, and a witness that fails to finish THERE TOO is slow or looping, not stdin-hungry, and is
# excluded rather than convicted. Conviction needs BOTH: blocks on the fifo AND completes on /dev/null.
