"""util_gc_asm_shim_tag_census.py -- DOES EVERY HAND-WRITTEN BOX-ENTRY SHIM HAND THE WALKER A TAG, OR A RAW WORD?
One row per shim, NAMED, never a bare count (INSTRUMENT LAWS batch 30 clause 2).

⛔ WHY THIS EXISTS (cto 2026-09-21, row prolog-every-asm-entry-shim-pushes-callee-saved-registers-as-tagged-cells-
not-raw-words, ceo CEO-1099; law RULES.md FACT RULE THE COLLECTOR GUESSES NOTHING, CEO-812; ARCH-GC 6.2i).
bb_glue_enter_c2bb stores the registers it saves as TAGGED CELLS so the walker reads them as data.  The hand-
written asm entry shims did a plain pushq of the same registers: RAW WORDS in a region no compile-time frame map
describes.  A raw word holding a heap pointer is not merely unread -- under a MOVING collector it is never
RELOCATED, so the shim restores a pointer to vacated ground.

⛔ THE POPULATION IS COMPUTED, NOT LISTED, and that is deliberate.  A box-entry shim is an __asm__ block that
JUMPS INDIRECTLY (jmp *%reg) -- that instruction IS the entry into the box.  A block that only jmps to a named
symbol is a trampoline and is not a member (eval_chain_enter_only is the live example).  A hard-coded roster of
seven would be a criterion keyed on a list, and the list would drift the first time a shim was added.

⭐ WHAT COUNTS AS A DEFECT HERE IS NARROWER THAN "A RAW PUSH", AND THE NARROWING IS THE MEASUREMENT.  Of the five
callee-saved registers these shims save, exactly ONE is heap-bearing by the tree's own convention: r13 holds the
Σ subject pointer and r15d its length, which is why bb_glue_enter_c2bb stores that PAIR as a single DT_S cell.
r14 the glue tags DT_I; r12 it stores raw (a pointer clamped into the dcap region) and rbx it stores raw (the
live frontier).  So this census grades r13 as MUST-BE-TAGGED and reports the other four as the
DECLARED-CONVENTION set -- named on every run so that "raw" is never silent, and so the day one of them does
become heap-bearing the row is already written.
