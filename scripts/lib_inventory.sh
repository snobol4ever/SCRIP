# lib_inventory.sh — THE ONE PACKAGE-INVENTORY BODY. Sourced by every package runner; never copied.
#
# ⭐ THE ORDER (Lon 2026-09-06, in-chat to ceo, verbatim: "Fix the never graded business. Let's lock
# down our package testing and make it complete."). Every program a vendored package SHIPS is either
# GRADED against the package's own oracle or NAMED UNGRADABLE with the oracle's reason. Never dropped,
# never counted as passed. The denominator is the SHIPPED population.
#
# ⛔⭐ WHAT THIS REPLACES, AND WHY A SINGLE `gap=` WAS THE DEFECT. Four runners already printed
# `shipped=N graded=N gap=N` (arizona, jcon, swi, aisnobol). `gap` is ONE bucket holding two things that
# must never be added together: "not graded YET" (work owed) and "CANNOT be graded" (a ruling, with the
# oracle's reason). ⛔ The lockdown's own criterion is `ungraded=0`, and while an ungradable program sits
# inside `gap` that criterion is UNREACHABLE BY BEING CORRECT — a lane can do every piece of real work
# available to it and still never reach the number. So `gap` splits, and the four buckets must SUM to
# shipped, which is what makes the line an inventory rather than four opinions.
#
# ⛔⭐⭐ THE FIFTH NUMBER, AND IT IS INVISIBLE PRECISELY BECAUSE IT LIVES INSIDE `graded` (hq_P 2026-09-06,
# from hq_B's measured case). The snoflake runner compares errors BY NUMBER — deliberately, documented,
# and correctly, since error TEXT cannot match byte-for-byte across implementations. Consequence:
# gimpel's topological-sort scored PASS FOR MONTHS while SCRIP printed its refusal at LINE 0 STATEMENT 0
# and printed it TWICE, against an oracle that prints it once at line 20 statement 5 and HALTS. Same
# integer, three defects. Such a program is NOT ungraded (it ran, it was compared, it matched) and NOT
# honestly graded either (the comparison was narrower than the claim the percent makes). Collapsed into
# `graded`, it lets a lane reach `ungraded=0` with a wrong program still running.
#
# ⭐ SO THE BUCKET IS NAMED FOR THE PROPERTY, NOT THE INSTANCE — hq_T's call, adopted by hq_P over their
# own ask, and the reason is on the record because it is the whole design: a bucket named
# `graded_errno_only` would silently grade every OTHER narrow instrument as an honest pass, and the next
# narrow comparison would land in `graded` and be rediscovered in three weeks with a different integer.
# `graded_narrow` = THE COMPARISON WAS NARROWER THAN THE CLAIM THE PERCENT MAKES. Error-number equality
# is member one, not the definition. Known siblings: grading rc alone with output to /dev/null (hq_I),
# and — hq_P's purest form — AN INSTRUMENT WHOSE SENSITIVITY IS BELOW THE EFFECT IT WAS BUILT TO DETECT
# IS NOT A WEAK TEST, IT IS A TEST THAT CANNOT FAIL, AND IT PRINTS THE SAME STRING AS ONE THAT PASSED
# (a leak check at 200,000 iterations: 1.6MB against an 8MB stack, passing forever).
#
# ⛔ AND EVERY NARROW GRADING NAMES ITSELF PER ENTRY, in NARROW.tsv. hq_P's sentence is the rule:
# AN UNEXPLAINED BUCKET IS JUST A SMALLER LIE. A count with no per-entry reason cannot be acted on and
# cannot be falsified, which is the same failure one size down.
#
# THE LINE, one shape, from every package runner:
#   PACKAGE_INVENTORY package=<name> shipped=N graded=N ungraded=N ungradable=N deferred=N graded_stream=N graded_narrow=N
#
# ⛔⭐⭐ THE SIXTH TERM, `deferred=N`, AND WHY IT IS ON THE LINE RATHER THAN BESIDE IT (hq_T 2026-09-12, ceo
# CEO-593, on Lon's CEO-579 *"Do not count the FD as failures for us."*). DEFERRED means IN SCOPE, NOT BUILT,
# NOT A FAILURE -- a scheduling ruling by Lon, never a fact about the oracle and never a seat's own judgement
# (ARCH-PROGRAM-LEDGER.md § DEFERRED, sovereign; `.github/DEFERRED.tsv` is its machine twin).
# ⛔ IT HAD TO JOIN THE SUM, WHICH IS WHY IT IS NOT A SECOND LINE LIKE THE SPLIT. The split is DETAIL and
# cannot change a total; a deferral is a BUCKET. Without it the five buckets already sum to shipped, so a
# deferred program has to be smuggled into `ungraded` to keep the arithmetic -- and then it is work owed,
# counted against the lane, which is exactly the ruling's opposite. There was no honest bucket for it, and
# a census with no bucket for a real population is the defect this whole library exists to end.
# ⭐ THE NAMES PRINT WITH IT (`inventory_deferred_line`, condition 2 of the ledger's three), because a name
# that cannot be red must be visible instead: A WRONG EXCLUSION COSTS MORE THAN A WRONG CURE (hq_V).
# ⭐ `deferred=0` for every package with a runner today -- the only DEFERRED population is gnu_fd's 30 FD
# programs and nothing grades them yet. The term lands at zero ON PURPOSE: a bucket added at the moment it is
# first needed is a bucket added by whoever needs the number to move.
#
# THE STANZA a runner writes (four tokens, same shape as lib_port_trace.sh's):
#   INV_PACKAGE=gimpel ; INV_DIR="$CORPUS/packages/snobol4/gimpel" ; INV_EXT=".sno"
#   inventory_line "$STREAM_PASSES" "$NARROW_PASSES"
#
# THE SIDECARS, beside the package (or one directory below it, as ipl/progs/UNGRADED.tsv already sits):
#   UNGRADED.tsv    name<TAB>CLASS<TAB>reason   work owed: why it is not graded YET
#                   name is the PACKAGE-RELATIVE PATH (a bare name only while it is unique in the tree)
#   UNGRADABLE.tsv  name<TAB>CLASS<TAB>reason   a ruling: the ORACLE's reason it cannot be graded
#   NARROW.tsv      name<TAB>NARROWING<TAB>reason   graded, but by a comparison narrower than the claim
#
# ⛔ ALL THREE ARE DECLARATIONS, NEVER INFERENCES. A runner may not decide at run time that something is
# ungradable; that is a ruling somebody makes once, in a file, with a reason a later reader can dispute.
#
# ⛔ THE FOURTH DECLARATION IS NOT A SIDECAR, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE: `.github/DEFERRED.tsv`, one file for
# every package, in the repo whose custody is the ceo's. The three above record MEASUREMENTS and the lane
# that measures owns them; a deferral LIFTS A SCORE, so it must not be editable by the lane whose number it
# raises. (`S4E_DEFERRED_TSV` redirects it, for scratch harnesses only.)

# ⛔⭐⭐ THE REASON-CODE VOCABULARY IS CLOSED (hq_T ruling 2026-09-06, asked for by hq_I: three lanes had
# invented three vocabularies in one morning -- CONTAINER_OR_LIBRARY (hq_I, seat03), NO-ORACLE-SHIPPED and
# ORACLE-IS-NOT-PROGRAM-OUTPUT (corpus a1623cf8f), EMPTY and ORACLE_FAIL (ipl/progs) -- in dashes and in
# underscores, for the same handful of situations).
#
# ⭐ THE RULING IS NOT MAINLY A SPELLING. It is that THE TWO FILES ANSWER TWO DIFFERENT QUESTIONS, so their
# class columns are different vocabularies and a class may not drift between them:
#   UNGRADABLE names WHAT THE ORACLE OR THE PACKAGE DID  -- a ruling, disputable, nobody owes work.
#   UNGRADED   names WHAT IS OWED                        -- a task, claimable, somebody can finish it.
# ⛔ So an UNGRADED class that names an OBSERVATION rather than a task is the defect one size down from
# ARM 8's. `EMPTY` is the measured case: 106 ipl rows say `EMPTY` in the class and *"needs a .in with
# representative input, not yet authored"* in the reason -- the file already knows what is owed, and the
# column a reader sorts by does not. A lane cannot pick up 106 rows of `EMPTY`; it can pick up 106 rows of
# NEEDS_STDIN_FIXTURE. Hence the respellings in INV_CLASS_LEGACY, which is DEBT, listed so it shrinks.
#
# ⭐ Spelling is UPPER_SNAKE because four of the five vocabularies already were; the dashed spellings are
# the minority, and a mixed convention means a grep for a class silently answers over a subset.
# THE TEST FOR ADMITTING A NEW UNGRADABLE CLASS IS NOT THE ONE FOR UNGRADED (hq_T, ruling NEEDS_DISPLAY in for
# hq_I 25 ipl gprogs whose oracle answers "cannot open display", 2026-09-06). UNGRADED classes stay coarse
# because the test there is "can a lane pick up every row of this class as ONE task" -- work buckets, and a
# member per situation defeats the point. But nobody owes work on an UNGRADABLE, so that test says nothing, and
# applying it anyway is how ORACLE_REFUSES becomes a bag holding a headless box beside a genuinely broken
# program. THE UNGRADABLE TEST IS: COULD THIS RULING BE OVERTURNED FOR THE WHOLE CLASS AT ONCE? A display is
# exactly that -- one xvfb-run moves all 25 together -- so the class is a handle somebody can grab, which is the
# same underlying property as the UNGRADED test wearing its other face. ORACLE_REFUSES stays for rulings that
# can only ever be revisited one program at a time. Note NEEDS_INTERACTIVE_TTY was already this family; naming
# the principle that admitted it means the next such class needs no HQ round trip.
# ⭐⭐ TWO REASONS ADMITTED 2026-09-06 (hq_T ruling, asked for by hq_I off four ipl rows), AND THEY ARE THE
# FIRST TWO WHERE THE LIMIT IS THE INSTRUMENT OR THE BOX RATHER THAN THE PROGRAM OR THE ORACLE. The test they
# had to pass is hq_I's and it is the one to apply to a third: UNGRADABLE MEANS NOBODY OWES WORK, SO EVERY
# REASON MUST TELL A READER SOMETHING THEY CAN ACT ON -- a name that makes a reader re-open a closed ruling has
# NEGATIVE value.
#   RESULT_NOT_ON_STDOUT -- the program's observable result is a WRITTEN FILE; the instrument compares combined
#     stdout+stderr against a .std, so it can only ever pin a 0-byte ref. ⛔ This is the one reason here that is
#     a fact about THE INSTRUMENT, which is why it is not a variant of the others: the rest are closed rulings,
#     this one is OPEN and names a capability the harness lacks (it can neither FEED a named file nor OBSERVE
#     one -- hq_T holds that row, paired with hq_P's declared data-file sidecar gap). Overturned for the whole
#     class at once the day the harness can observe a named output file, which is the UNGRADABLE admission test.
#     ⛔ DO NOT grade these on their error path instead: pinning a program's own complaint as its ground truth
#     grades nothing the program is for and produces a GREEN cell over a program that never did its job. hq_I
#     measured exactly that trap while cutting these three -- idxtext prints 23 bytes at rc=1 on plain text and
#     ZERO bytes at rc=0 on the gettext-format input it is actually for.
#   ENVIRONMENT_IDENTITY_IN_OUTPUT -- the output carries WHO OR WHERE THE RUN HAPPENED (user, host, path), so a
#     ref cut here is valid only here. ⭐ STABLE IN TIME, VARIES IN SPACE, and that axis is kept in this
#     documentation deliberately, because it is what stops the next reader reaching for NONDETERMINISTIC: nobody
#     can fix this by re-running, and a run-twice check sees a byte-stable program and calls the ruling wrong.
#     The name has to say WHERE rather than WHEN.
# ⛔⭐⭐ AND THE ADMISSION TEST ABOVE IS NOT ENOUGH ON ITS OWN -- SHARPENED 2026-09-10 BY THE ROW THAT WAS
#     REFUSED UNDER IT (hq_V's kwds ask, ceo CEO-514; the correction is hq_V's and is recorded here because a
#     ruling's own limits belong beside the ruling and not in a mailbox). The test I offered was CAN ANY
#     ENVIRONMENT MAKE THESE AGREE -- a row whose output no environment can reconcile is a permanent ruling, one
#     that some environment can is deferred work wearing a ruling's clothes. kwds passed that test and was still
#     deferred work: &version &features &allocated &storage genuinely cannot agree across two implementations,
#     and the ruling closed on exactly that permanence -- but THE PROGRAM WAS FREE TO STOP PRINTING THEM, which
#     is what the cure did. It now prints type() of the four, so existence and type stay graded, the values are
#     not, the row is GONE and the program is green in both modes.
#     ⭐ PERMANENCE ABOUT A VALUE IS NOT PERMANENCE ABOUT A PROGRAM. So the question to ask before closing any
#     UNGRADABLE row is not "can any environment make these agree" but "CAN THE PROGRAM BE MADE TO STOP ASKING",
#     and the first reads as the second while quietly answering something weaker. ⛔ It fails in the direction
#     this file's tie-break already calls the expensive one: a permanent-looking fact makes a ruling feel safe
#     to close, and a closed ruling is what nobody re-reads.

# THE TIE-BREAK, AND IT IS THE MOST LOAD-BEARING SENTENCE IN THIS FILE (hq_T, ruling hq_P's three gimpel
# ERROR-285 drivers, 2026-09-06). hq_P found three rows whose bucket turns on ONE UNMEASURED FACT: FRSORT,
# TIMEGC and TIMER die "include file cannot be opened" because the include chain wants stringout.sno,
# resolution.sno and system.inc, which exist nowhere in corpus. If gimpel never shipped them, that is a ruling
# about the package. If upstream ships them and we failed to vendor them, it is work we owe. hq_P established
# only the absence, said so, and refused to decide it by picking the class that made their own line sum -- which
# is the behaviour the whole lockdown depends on and is worth more than the answer.
# WHEN THE BUCKET TURNS ON A FACT NOBODY HAS MEASURED, THE ANSWER IS UNGRADED. The two errors are not
# symmetric: a wrong UNGRADABLE removes a program from the debt PERMANENTLY and silently -- nobody re-reads a
# closed ruling -- while a wrong UNGRADED merely looks like unfinished work, which is what it will look like
# anyway until someone measures. One failure mode hides work forever; the other costs a row that stays open.
# So the missing measurement never blocks the landing: it can only ever move a row FROM ungraded TO ungradable,
# and that direction is the one a human is forced to justify. Same asymmetry ARM 8 protects one level up.

# hq_I cured jcon concurrently with this ruling landing and wrote NEEDS_MULTIFILE_LINK -- a good, precise

# classes refuse" would have red-lit a lane delivering exactly the work Lon had just ordered, and the lane
# would have been right to route around the ruling. ⭐ THE RULING STANDS AND THE FILE STILL PASSES: the
# CLASS is the bucket a lane sorts and picks up work by, so it stays coarse (NEEDS_RUNNER_WIRING covers
# "the runner cannot invoke it the way the package's own harness does" -- a two-file compile and a -L
# preload are the same pickup), and the REASON column carries the specificity, where it costs nothing. A
# vocabulary that grows a member per situation is the every-lane-invents-a-spelling problem wearing a
# tidier hat. ⛔ So the map is not only for pre-ruling debt: it is how a closed vocabulary absorbs a
# collision without stopping anyone, which is the only reason closing one is safe to do mid-flight.

    # ⛔⭐⭐ AN UNGRADABLE DECLARATION MUST GIVE THE ORACLE'S REASON, NEVER OURS -- and this is the arm
    # that stops the lockdown from being satisfiable by failing. hq_C measured it on prolog/swi_tests
    # 2026-09-06: EXCLUDED.md names 240 programs as not graded and 240 OF 240 GIVE A SCRIP-SIDE REASON
    # ("scrip produces zero PASS/FAIL/EMPTY lines for this file today"), ZERO give an oracle-side one.
    # ⛔ A PROGRAM EXCLUDED BECAUSE OUR OWN COMPILER FAILS IT IS A RED MOVED OUT OF THE DENOMINATOR: the
    # score cannot fall when we fail, because failing is what removes the entry. Against the real oracle
    # only FIVE of 170 were genuinely ungradable, all oracle-side (swipl aborts, SIGSEGVs, times out).
    # ⭐ AND NOTE WHY NOBODY CAUGHT IT, because it is the reason this must be a machine check rather than
    # a review habit: every one of those 240 entries is individually honest and well documented, naming
    # file, rung and exact error. 240 carefully-written TRUE notes compose into a denominator that cannot
    # fall. Diligence at the entry level is exactly what makes the aggregate invisible.
    # ⭐⭐ AND THE ONE ADMITTED EXCEPTION IS A CONTROL, NOT A LOOSENING (ceo CEO-541, 2026-09-10, on hq_T's
    # ask). A row may name our compiler when, and only when, it does what icon/ipl's gincl/maccolor.icn does:
    # state THE ORACLE'S OWN VERDICT FIRST AND INDEPENDENTLY (Arizona icont refuses at line 23, verbatim, and
    # upstream's UNMODIFIED copy refuses identically), and only THEN add that we refuse at the same line with
    # the same class. That last clause is an AGREEMENT CONTROL: it does not carry the ruling, it shows the
    # ruling is not our own damage. ⛔ THE DISCRIMINATOR IS THE ONE THIS WHOLE ARM USES -- THE RULING MUST
    # STAND UNCHANGED IF SCRIP WERE PERFECT AT EVERYTHING ELSE -- and here it does: a perfect SCRIP would
    # still be refused by icont at line 23, so the row survives its own agreement clause being deleted.
    # ⛔ AND IT IS ADMITTED BY A MARKER, NOT BY A READER'S JUDGEMENT, which is the entire point of CEO-541:
    # `AGREEMENT-CONTROL:` prefixes OUR clause, so the arm separates a control from a failure-as-reason
    # MECHANICALLY. Without the marker the row stays refused however true its prose -- the tpp precedent
    # below is unweakened, and a row that merely mentions us in passing has not earned an exception.
    # ⭐ WHY THE PREFIX MUST ITSELF BE CLEAN: "stated independently" is checkable exactly once -- the text
    # BEFORE the marker must name the oracle and must NOT name us. If our compiler appears ahead of the
    # marker the oracle's verdict is no longer stated on its own, and a reader cannot tell whether the
    # ruling would survive without it. That is the same property ARM 8 has always protected; the marker
    # moves it from prose a reviewer must weigh to a position a grep can find.

    ⛔ UNGRADABLE is a statement about the ORACLE, never about us. A program excluded because SCRIP fails it is a RED MOVED OUT OF THE DENOMINATOR -- the score cannot fall when we fail, because failing is what removes the entry. If the oracle grades it and we do not, it is GRADED and RED. Move it, or give the oracle's own reason.
    ⭐ AND A ROW CITING **BOTH** IS STILL REFUSED, deliberately -- measured on arizona general/tpp.icn, whose reason gives \"TWO reasons this is ungradable here\": one oracle-side (tpp.ok was never vendored) and one ours (no preprocessor-only mode). The oracle-side half is sufficient on its own, so state it on its own; while our half is written beside it a reader cannot tell whether the ruling would survive without it, and that is the whole property this arm protects.
    ⭐ THE ONE ADMITTED SHAPE (ceo CEO-541) is an AGREEMENT CONTROL: state the oracle's verdict first and on its own, then prefix our clause with $INV_AGREEMENT_MARKER -- as in \`... Arizona icont REFUSES IT AT COMPILE, rc=1, verbatim \"...\"; upstream's unmodified copy refuses identically. $INV_AGREEMENT_MARKER we refuse at the same line with the same class, so we AGREE with the oracle.\` The text before the marker must NAME THE ORACLE and must NOT name us; nothing else is accepted, and the marker cannot rescue a row whose ruling rests on our failure."
