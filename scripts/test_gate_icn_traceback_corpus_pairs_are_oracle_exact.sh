# ⭐⭐ GATE: THE TWO ON-DISK TRACEBACK WITNESSES MATCH THEIR ORACLE-CUT REFS, BYTE FOR BYTE, IN BOTH MODES.
# Clause 1 of FINDING-2026-09-10-ceo-a-generator-records-no-activation-so-three-symptoms-in-three-lanes-are-
# one-root.md, made mechanical (ceo CEO-541: "make that generator witness permanent and gradable AS clause 1
# of the finding"). The cure is the cto's `3e68226ea` -- the flat_gen prologue now records an activation, as
# a record-only tap so the trace lines stay exactly as they were.
# ⛔ WHY THIS EXISTS BESIDE test_gate_icn_generator_records_its_activation.sh RATHER THAN INSTEAD OF IT, since
# a duplicate gate is worse than none. That gate is the cto's and grades the MECHANISM through witnesses it
# writes into a scratch dir at run time, against expectations typed into the gate. This one grades the two
# PERMANENT corpus pairs against refs CUT FROM icont+iconx, which is a different and stronger kind of
# evidence and covers something no inline gate can: the corpus pairs themselves, which nothing globs and
# nothing else runs, so they would bit-rot ungraded exactly when someone needs them. ⭐ I checked the
# overlap rather than assuming it: the cto's hand-typed `g3.want` was re-cut from live iconx here and came
# back BYTE-IDENTICAL, so their expectations are sound and this gate is not a correction of them.
# ⛔ THE HISTORY THAT MAKES THE SECOND PAIR LOAD-BEARING, and it is the whole reason this gate has a control
# arm. The finding's ORIGINAL clause 1 named an ordinary three-frame witness (main -> f -> g, 1/0 in g).
# That witness was CURED BY A NEIGHBOUR's work on the ordinary call path within the hour, so the clause went
# green while the generator gap it was written for stood untouched -- an open row grading as done, on the
# wrong evidence. The generator pair replaced it. Keeping the ordinary pair as the CONTROL is what stops the
# reverse mistake: a change that made the record tap fire for everything, or that disturbed the ordinary
# prologue, is invisible to the generator arm alone and shows up here.
# ARMS: (1)(2) generator pair, m3 and m4, byte-equal to its oracle-cut ref
#       (3) the generator frame line is PRESENT BY NAME in both mode outputs -- a probe asserts its named
#           witness, never a positional diff count (RULES.md)
#       (4)(5) CONTROL: ordinary-call pair, m3 and m4, byte-equal to its ref -- the ordinary path still
#           records every frame after the generator cure
#       (6) ANTI-TAMPER SELF-CHECK: each ref itself still carries the frame line it exists to pin, so
#           "fixing" a red by blanking a ref REFUSES rc=2 instead of passing
# ⛔ REFUSES rc=2 (never green) when it cannot measure: no scrip, no gcc, or either corpus pair missing.
