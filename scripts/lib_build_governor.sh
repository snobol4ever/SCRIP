# lib_build_governor.sh -- row `build-governor-concurrent-pristine`. Serializes the fleet's HEAVY windows
# (make pristine, full-corpus boards, benchmark runs) so a benchmark is never measuring while another root
# is mid-build. Sourceable (defines governor_build / governor_bench) AND directly executable (see dispatch
# at the bottom), so a Makefile recipe can invoke it without sourcing and a bash script can source it.
#
# ⭐ WHY THIS IS A READ/WRITE LOCK, NOT AN N-SLOT COUNTER. The row's own point 2 overrides its point 1's "N
# slots" phrasing: "N concurrent builds is merely slow; one build concurrent with one benchmark makes the
# benchmark a lie. Model it as a read/write lock -- builds share, a benchmark takes it exclusively." That IS
# flock's native shared (-s) vs exclusive (-x) mode on one file: unlimited concurrent -s holders, and -x
# waits for every -s (and any other -x) to release first. No hand-rolled counter needed or wanted -- a
# counter you maintain yourself is exactly the "lockdir of your own invention" the row forbids, because it
# does not release on process death the way flock's kernel-held lock does.
#
# ⛔ WHY THERE IS NO STALE-LOCK CLEANUP CODE. The row's DONE-WHEN prose says "missing, stale, unwritable" --
# but flock is held on an open file descriptor, released by the kernel the instant every fd referencing it
# closes, including on SIGKILL or a crash. There is no PID file to go stale and nothing here to sweep. Only
# the semaphore PATH can be unusable (missing parent dir, wrong file type, permissions) -- that is what
# _governor_preflight checks, and it is the only "stale" this design can even have.
#
# EXIT CODE CONTRACT (point 4: degrade to a refusal, never a silent pass):
#   2   governor infra failure -- preflight refused, or the lock itself could not be opened/acquired.
#       The wrapped command NEVER RUNS.
#   3   --try mode ONLY: the slot is held by a conflicting holder right now. The wrapped command NEVER RUNS.
#   64  usage error (no command given to wrap).
#   *   any other code is the WRAPPED COMMAND's own exit status, passed through verbatim.
# A caller can therefore always tell "governor refused" (2/3) from "the work itself failed" (anything else).

# S4E_GOVERNOR_LOCK overrides the semaphore path -- used by test_gate_build_governor.sh to run its negative
# tests against a scratch file instead of the real shared semaphore (a gate run must never contend with a
# genuine fleet build/benchmark).
