# test_gate_icn_traceback_names_the_source_file_not_the_last_argv.sh -- A RUN-TIME ERROR TRACEBACK AND &file
# NAME THE SOURCE FILE, NOT THE PROGRAM'S LAST ARGUMENT (cfo 2026-09-12, found by the shootout kernels).
#
# THE DEFECT, MEASURED: `procedure main(a); write(1 + a[1]); end` run as `scrip tb.icn -- x` died with
# `File x; Line 2` where iconx says `File tb.icn; Line 2`; fannkuch.icn run with 7 died `File 7; Line 58`.
# The driver had already recorded the source path per input while walking argv, then RE-SET it from
# argv[argc-1] after the walk -- which, once a `--` has split program arguments off, is the last of THEM.
# Every reader of that name moved with it: the traceback's File line, the per-frame `from line N in FILE`,
# &file, and the DWARF location. Same in both modes because the name is sealed at compile time.
#
# THE REF IS CUT FROM THE ORACLE AT RUN TIME: stdout (which prints &file) must be byte-identical, and the
# stderr lines that carry a file name (`File ...; Line ...` and `from line N in ...`) must match line for
# line. The rest of the traceback is not graded here -- other gates own its shape.
# ⭐ SELF-TEST SEAM: GATE_FAIL_ONCE=1 rewrites our extracted File line to the last argument so the gate is seen to say no.
