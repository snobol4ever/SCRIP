# test_gate_icn_zcells_gva.sh — ZK-5 GATE: globals stay OFF the cells-arm ZD spine (GVA/NV path, not ζ cells)
#
# THREE CHECKS:
#   1. CORRECTNESS: CELLS=1 global witness produces same output as baseline.
#   2. ASSERTION: SCRIP_ZD_CENSUS=1 run does NOT abort (ZK-5 global-cells=0 invariant held).
#   3. CENSUS: census shows 0 armed nodes for the global-only witness program (globals all refused).
#
# Completion criterion (ZK-5): these three checks green on the global witness.
#
# ⛔ CHECK 1 WAS A TAUTOLOGY; DRIVER VARIABLE REPAIRED (s247, seat1, rung N-0).  The gate compared a baseline
# run against a "SCRIP_ICN_CELLS=1" run and called the equality a correctness result.  Z-1 (s230, db728001)
# made SCRIP_ICN_CELLS A NO-OP unless SCRIP_ICN_LEGACY=1 is set too, so BOTH SIDES WERE THE SAME
# CONFIGURATION and the comparison could not fail for any reason in this gate's subject.  CHECK 1 is now the
# real anchor: the default arm (which IS the cells arm) against the pinned .expected, and a missing .expected
# is a hard failure rather than a silent pass through the else-branch.  ⛔ The pre-Z-1 A/B cannot be restored:
# SCRIP_ICN_LEGACY=1 CORE-DUMPS on this witness (measured s247), so the transition killswitch no longer
# reproduces a working configuration — recorded in GOAL-ICON-100 as evidence for the N-5 fold.
