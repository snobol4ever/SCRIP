#
# WHAT WAS THERE. A substring trapped variable (s[i], !s, ?s) remembers its subject variable, position and length. When
# the subject shrank below it before the store -- s[5] := (s := "ab", "z") -- c_rt_assign_var_body's tvsubs arm and
# rt_swap_var both FAILED in silence, so the program carried on where Arizona iconx stops with run-time error 205.
#
# WHAT IS HERE. The two sides of iconx, measured in its source and reproduced: an ASSIGNMENT to a trapped substring past
# its subject is oasgn.r's ReturnErrNum(205), a CONVERTIBLE error (under &error it is failure with &errornumber 205), so
# the tvsubs arm raises core_icn_error(205) when the assignment is Icon's (strict); a SWAP dereferences both operands first,
# and cnv.r's deref of a trapped substring past its subject is fatalerr(205), which &error does NOT convert, so rt_swap_var
# (Icon-only: only lower_icon.c emits IR_SWAP) raises it through core_icn_fatal before either operand is read.
#
# ARM. Five witnesses graded against the LIVE oracle (icont/iconx 9.5.25a) on stdout AND exit status in both media: the
# assignment, a swap whose right operand shrinks the subject, a swap with a list element, a swap with a literal (111, a
# control that was already right), and the &error witness where the assignment converts and the swap does not. A mutual
# evaluation yielding its last operand's variable is the green control. RUN FIRST THEN WIRED (CEO-381): on SCRIP
# 8b6cb3607 the four 205 witnesses read RED in both media (stdout "failed", rc 0 where iconx exits 1).
