# scripts/test_icon_rung_suite.sh — Icon rung ladder runner, ALL THREE MODES (GOAL-ICON-BB discipline).
# Self-contained. Run from anywhere with no env vars.
# Usage: bash scripts/test_icon_rung_suite.sh [--rung RUNG] [--mode MODE] [--scrip PATH] [--corpus PATH]
#
# GOAL-ICON-BB mandates running ALL modes on every gate run (the "ALWAYS TEST ALL THREE MODES" policy,
# adopted from GOAL-PROLOG-BB's session-sync three-mode stepping). With no --mode (or --mode all, the
# DEFAULT) every corpus program is run through all three engine paths against its .expected:
#   interp  (Mode 2, --run)                 — reference oracle — HARD GATE (PASS must be >= previous).
#   run     (Mode 3, --run, stackless native)  — TRACKED. A shape with no native template REFUSES LOUD
#                                                 with the [SMX] banner -> counted REFUSED (NOT a FAIL).
#   compile (Mode 4, --compile --target=x86)   — emit .s -> as -> link out/libscrip_rt.so -> exec.
#                                                 TRACKED, same [SMX] -> REFUSED rule.
# A mode-3/4 run whose stderr carries the [SMX] refuse banner is reported REFUSED (expected mid-Ground
# -Zero, NOT FAIL) and auto-resumes counting toward PASS the moment that box family gets a native template.
# This is the Icon twin of test_prolog_rung_suite.sh; the [SMX]->REFUSED mechanism is identical.
# Pass --mode interp|run|compile to run a single mode. This is the THREE-MODE source of truth for the Icon
# rung ladder (test_icon_all_rungs.sh remains the mode-2-only category-tally view).
#
# SUITE-FORMAT DELEGATION (tests-consolidate-icon, 2026-08-28): a family converted by
# corpus_suite_harness.py loses its loose rungNN_*.icn files and becomes one <family>.icn+.ref pair.
# Globbing loose files directly would silently lose that family the moment its loose originals are
# removed (empty-glob false-green -- the same class test_prolog_rung_suite.sh fixed for Prolog).
# collect_files() also gathers converted families into SUITE_FILES (discriminator: has a .ref sibling
# and NO .expected sibling -- loose files always carry both); run_corpus() delegates those to
# `corpus_suite_harness.py run` for EVERY mode, unlike the Prolog twin which withholds compile --
# Icon's m4 is proven live (tests-consolidate-icon ledger, seat01 2026-08-28: verified round-trip
# before adding the LANG_CONFIGS entry), so there is no untested-grading caveat to withhold it for.
# ⛔ A suite file's name still matches the raw rungNN_*.icn glob (e.g. rung04_string.icn matches
# rung0[1-9]_*.icn) -- collect_files() MUST route it to SUITE_FILES, never FILES: unlike Prolog's
# per-file loop (which just `continue`s past a missing .expected), THIS script's FILES loop counts
# a missing .expected as MISSING and trips MODE_FAIL -- leaving a suite file in FILES would self-
# inflict a false failure, not merely skip silently.
