# ⭐⭐ GATE: no emitted .s may reference a procedure's α ENTRY LABEL that nothing defines.
#
# THE CLASS, twice witnessed, different triggers, same shape:
#   1. hq_P 2026-08-29 — bb_define emitted `lea r9, [rip + <fn>_α]` whenever `_.lbl_t0` was non-null, but
#      `<fn>_α` is DEFINED only when the body is a tiny shim. Any DEFINE'd proc calling INPUT/OUTPUT referenced
#      a label nobody emitted -> `ld: relocation R_X86_64_PC32 against undefined symbol` under PIE.
#      (.github FINDING-2026-08-29-hq_P-alpha-reference-and-definition-gated-on-different-predicates.md)
#   2. seat16 2026-08-30 — forcing the SNO$STMT hook on put ARITH_LOOP_α in the referenced-but-undefined set;
#      a hook prepended to a DEFINE'd body's first statement, a completely different trigger. (.github ed132985)
# ⛔ A REFERENCE AND ITS DEFINITION MUST BE GATED ON THE SAME PREDICATE. This gate tests that mechanically
# instead of waiting for a linker to say so on whichever program happens to exercise it.
#
# ⭐ WHY NOT JUST LINK IT: the board already compiles+links and folds a link failure into SKIP, not FAIL
# (test_corpus_snobol4.sh:127) -- so this defect can hide behind a green board. This gate reads the ASM and
# refuses, which is also faster and names the symbol instead of a relocation.
#
# ⛔ THE EXEMPTION IS REAL AND MUST NOT BE REMOVED: the driver deliberately emits `.weak <fn>_α` plus
# `<fn>_α@GOTPCREL` for dyn_scope procedures (scrip.c, rt_proc_seal_alpha). That is PIE-safe against an
# undefined weak symbol BY DESIGN -- it resolves to NULL and the runtime copes. So an undefined α is a DEFECT
# only when something references it DIRECTLY (a bare `lea`/`jmp`, no @GOTPCREL). Measured on a cured build:
# helper_α weak=1 got=1 direct_refs=0 -> clean.
# ⛔⭐ THIS GATE WAS VACUOUS ON ITS FIRST RUN AND ITS OWN SELF-TEST CAUGHT IT (hq_P, same session). The
# patterns were written as '..._\xce\xb1:' inside SINGLE QUOTES, where bash does NOT expand \x escapes, so
# grep matched the literal text and found ZERO labels -- and an empty defined-set minus an empty referenced-set
# is empty, which printed "ok" for every witness. It would have passed on a known-broken build. Use the LITERAL
# α below; do not "portability-fix" it back into escapes without re-running the self-test.

# ⭐⭐ SELF-TEST FIRST — THIS GATE PROVES IT CAN GO RED BEFORE IT IS ALLOWED TO REPORT GREEN.
# A detector that has never fired is indistinguishable from one that cannot fire, and this fleet has now
# catalogued that class repeatedly (a skip-as-success rung harness, a tautological emit gate, and my own
# vacuous 1-byte oracle). So: compile a known-good witness, DELETE one α definition that is directly
# referenced, and require the predicate to catch it. If it does not, the instrument is broken and this exits
# rc=2 -- UNPROVEN -- rather than printing the success shape over a detector that cannot detect.
