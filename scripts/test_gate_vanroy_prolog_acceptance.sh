# test_gate_vanroy_prolog_acceptance.sh -- the PERF-SIDE ACCEPTANCE INSTRUMENT of the PROLOG REDESIGN program (Lon escalation 2026-09-02 10:00, ceo-routed; hq_P owns P6 and P7).
#
# ⭐ WHAT IT GRADES: the 21 van Roy kernels in their COUNTED form, mode 3, GENERATED per run (see the note at D= below; they were read from the retired corpus/benchmarks/prolog/vanroy/ until 2026-09-13). Baseline measured by hq_P at SCRIP fa12d7cb, -O0:
#     3 CLEAN · 8 REFUSE (rc=134) · 8 SIGSEGV (rc=139) · 2 rc=1
# The 8 REFUSE are derive deriv divide10 ham meta_qsort queens sendmore tak, and every one is the SAME failure -- "SCRIP FATAL: pl_trail_unwind refuses corrupt trail mark ... its PRODUCER handed
# over garbage" -- i.e. the PZ-4 trail-mark-corruption class. That is why PZ-4 (hq_C) lands first and P7/P6 sequence behind it.
#
# ⛔⛔ WHY IT DOES NOT GRADE "REFUSE 0" ALONE, WHICH IS WHAT THE PROGRAM WAS FIRST SCOPED AS (hq_P raised it, and it is the single most important line in this file): THE REFUSAL IS A GUARD.
# `pl_trail_unwind` REFUSES because it caught a corrupt trail mark before acting on it. So a change that turns a REFUSE into a SIGSEGV PASSES a REFUSE-0 criterion -- and so does DELETING THE GUARD.
# ⭐ THAT IS NOT HYPOTHETICAL HERE: there are ALREADY 8 SIGSEGVs sitting beside the 8 REFUSEs, so "make the refusals stop" has a shorter path than curing them, and it ends at a board that is strictly
# worse than today while reading green. An acceptance test whose cheapest satisfying change is a regression is the vacuous-test class Lon flagged, aimed at the row Lon escalated.
# ✅ SO ACCEPTANCE IS ALL THREE AT ONCE: REFUSE 0 **and** SIGSEGV 0 **and** CLEAN never below the pinned floor. Any one alone is gameable; together they are not.
#
# ⛔ NEVER LOWER A PIN TO REACH GREEN. Raising CLEAN_FLOOR after a real cure is the intended motion and belongs in the same commit as the cure, citing the FINDING.
#
# ⛔⛔⭐ AND IT REPEATS EACH KERNEL, BECAUSE A SINGLE PASS OVER THIS BOARD IS NOT A MEASUREMENT. MEASURED hq_P 2026-09-02 on ONE UNCHANGED BINARY (SCRIP fa12d7cb), four consecutive full passes:
#   CLEAN 3,4,4,4 · REFUSE 8,4,7,5 · CRASH 8,11,8,10
# ELEVEN OF THE 21 KERNELS FLIP between REFUSE, CRASH and CLEAN run to run with no change of any kind -- derive deriv divide10 ham log10 meta_qsort ops8 queens sendmore tak times10. `tak` reads R.R.
# (clean half the time); `deriv` reads .RRR. ⛔ SO "REFUSE 0" AS A SINGLE-PASS CRITERION IS NOT REPRODUCIBLE: a seat can reach it BY CHANCE, and can read a real cure as a regression, in the same hour.
# ⭐ THE CURE FOR THE INSTRUMENT IS WORST-OF-N: each kernel runs REPS times and is classified by its WORST outcome (CRASH > REFUSE > other > CLEAN). That is monotone and stable -- a kernel counts as
# CLEAN only if it is clean EVERY time -- so the board stops flapping and a cure has to hold, not merely occur once.
# ⭐ THE FLAPPING IS ALSO EVIDENCE, AND IT BELONGS IN THE DESIGN PAGE: a corrupt trail mark that sometimes crashes and sometimes gets CAUGHT by pl_trail_unwind is reading memory whose content varies
# between runs -- consistent with the retained frame living BELOW rsp and being clobbered by whatever the next call happens to write there. That is PZ-4's clause (a) mechanism, observed from the outside.

# ⛔⭐ THE 21 KERNELS ARE GENERATED, NOT READ OUT OF GIT (hq_P 2026-09-13, CEO-567). This gate used to read
# corpus/benchmarks/prolog/vanroy/*.pl -- 21 checked-in files, each bench/<k>.pl with `main :- l__(N).` frozen in, i.e. the
# iteration count living inside the artifact under measurement. That directory is RETIRED; gen_counted_set() rebuilds the same
# 21 kernels at the same 21 counts from the pristine bench/ sources plus corpus/benchmarks/prolog/fixed-iter-n.tsv, which is
# where those N values were lifted to, verbatim by execution. THE NAME STAYS: "van Roy" is the kernels' PROVENANCE, not the
# directory's. ⛔ The CLEAN_FLOOR above was pinned against the OLD checked-in files, which were generated from PRE-conversion
# bench/ sources (they wrapped a self-timing main/0 that raised existence_error(wall_us/1)); the subject is the same 21
# computations at the same counts, but it is not the same bytes -- so the floor is re-proven against this form, never assumed.
# ⛔⭐ FOURTH DIMENSION, REPORTED NOT BLOCKING (hq_P 2026-09-13, CEO-676): "CLEAN" HERE MEANS rc=0, AND rc=0 IS
# WEAKER THAN THE CLAIM THIS BOARD IS READ AS MAKING. Measured on this tree with loop_check() wired into the m3
# census: SEVEN of the 21 exit 0 WITHOUT producing their N answers -- deriv 26954/65536, divide10 15186/65536,
# meta_qsort 199/1024, nrev 1438/65536, ops8 26954/65536, zebra 11/256, and ham 107/16 (which OVER-produces,
# because the wrapper's trailing `fail` backtracks into a nondeterministic kernel). A truncated run scored CLEAN.
# ⛔ SO WHY IS THE VERDICT NOT SIMPLY RE-CUT? BECAUSE `nrev` IS ONE OF THE THREE KERNELS CLEAN_FLOOR=3 IS PINNED
# ON. Redefining CLEAN to include the output check would drop CLEAN below its own floor and the gate would read
# as a REGRESSION when nothing regressed -- and the cure for that reads as LOWERING A PIN, which line 15 forbids
# outright and rightly: it is the motion every gamed gate makes. ⭐ A criterion that gets STRONGER is not a cure
# and must never be cashed as one, and it is not a regression either; it is a re-cut baseline, and the honest
# shape for a re-cut is the SUITES.tsv `criterion_changed` discipline -- the new number published BESIDE the old
# with its reason, never silently in place of it. So CLEAN_FLOOR keeps grading exactly what it was pinned
# against (rc=0, worst-of-REPS), and CLEAN_GRADED is printed beside it, named per kernel, blocking NOTHING today.
# ⛔ THE RAMP TO BLOCKING IS A ceo/Lon DECISION, NOT A SCRIPT AUTHOR'S -- it needs the floor re-pinned against the
# graded criterion in the same commit, citing the measurement. Until then this half is EVIDENCE, not a verdict.
