# lib_oracle_flags.sh -- ⭐ THE ONE AUTHORITY for the SPITBOL oracle's LANGUAGE ARM.
#
# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS (s200, row `bench-timed-oracle-flag`).  The s189 ruling established that `-bf` is the
# ONLY correct arm for grading or timing SCRIP against SPITBOL: SPITBOL CASE-FOLDS names by default (manual
# v3.7 p.23 names, p.28 labels) and `-f` turns folding OFF (p.162), which is the arm SCRIP -- declared
# CASE-SENSITIVE by RULES.md -- is MEASURED to agree with in three independent constructs (names/labels, the
# special name `output` vs `OUTPUT` p.192, and indirect reference `$('ABC')` p.182).  `scorecard_snobol4.sh`
# adopted it; the TIMING harnesses did not, and kept `-b`.  So the correctness board and the performance board
# were grading two DIFFERENT LANGUAGES, and `NOISE-FLOOR.tsv` was baked under the wrong one.
#
# ⛔ THE SPLIT THIS FILE ENCODES, AND WHY IT IS NOT ONE FUNCTION.  The LANGUAGE arm (`-bf`) is universal and is
# never a per-suite choice -- that was the whole s189 finding.  The SIZING knobs are NOT universal and are not a
# language question: a correctness run wants `-d512m -i64m` (heap/stack for the big corpus programs), a timed run
# wants `-s16m` (the json deserializer's recursive descent overflows the default stack).  Sizing a stack is not a
# throughput knob and not a semantics knob.  Callers therefore take `sbl_lang_flags` VERBATIM and append their own
# sizing -- they may never substitute for it.
#
# ⛔ CALLERS MUST REFUSE, NOT FALL BACK.  A harness that cannot load this file must exit non-zero and say so.  A
# silent private default is exactly the defect this file retires: it looks like a measurement and is a different
# language.  (Same shape as row `suite-table-one-authority`, where the refusal is the load-bearing half.)
sbl_lang_flags() { echo "-bf"; }

# ⭐⭐ THE ONE AUTHORITY for DIVERTING SPITBOL'S LISTING OUT OF THE COMPARED STREAM (hq_B 2026-09-04, ceo
# CEO-251 on the snoflake grading ruling).  MEASURED on snoflake: `sbl -bf` printed `macro spitbol version
# 4.0f`, an `x86-64 <date>` line, page headers and a full statement listing on 56 of 180 fixtures.  NOT from
# our flags -- `-b` already suppresses the signon -- but from `-LIST` control lines INSIDE the fixtures, which
# no command-line flag can pre-empt.  Any harness that compares SCRIP's output against the oracle's byte-for-
# byte fails those on SPITBOL's own furniture rather than on semantics; with this flag the count went 56 -> 0.
# Errors STILL arrive on stdout with it set, so an "errors included" comparison is unaffected -- verified.
# ⛔⛔ IT FAILS OPEN, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE REASON THIS IS A FUNCTION AND NOT A STRING.  SPITBOL APPENDS `.lst`
# to the name, so `-o=/dev/null` becomes `/dev/null.lst`, which it cannot open -- whereupon it prints
# `-o file open error.` and DUMPS THE LISTING TO STDOUT ANYWAY.  The caller then compares against a stream that
# silently regained the furniture this flag exists to remove, and nothing in the exit code says so.  A caller
# that grades on the oracle's stdout MUST treat `-o file open error.` in the output as a REFUSAL (rc=2), never
# as a fixture result.  Pass a directory you have already created and can write.
# ⛔ DELIBERATELY NOT FOLDED INTO sbl_lang_flags: that returns the SEMANTICS flags every caller takes verbatim,
# and this one needs a PATH.  Baking a relative name in would drop a `.lst` file into whatever cwd each caller
# happens to run in -- including corpus directories, where it could collide with a fixture's own companions.
# ⛔⭐ THE SINK TRADES ONE LEAK FOR ANOTHER, AND THE SECOND ONE IS INVISIBLE — PASS THE ORACLE A SHORT
# FILENAME, NEVER A LONG ABSOLUTE PATH (hq_B 2026-09-04, measured on `trace-procedure`).  SPITBOL formats
# a diagnostic as `<path>(<line>) : ERROR <n> -- <text>`, wraps it at COLUMN 119 into the LISTING, and
# spills only the OVERFLOW onto stdout.  Without this flag the listing IS stdout, so `ERROR <n>` is
# visible and everything looks fine.  WITH this flag the first 119 characters are diverted into the sink,
# so a caller passing a 73-char absolute path receives the bare tail `t trace type` on the compared
# stream -- the error NUMBER, which is the only durable half of a SPITBOL diagnostic, is gone.  A grader
# that falls back to comparing error numbers then finds none and returns FAIL.
#   MEASURED, and note the direction: exactly 119 characters are lost regardless of message length, so a
#   LONGER path leaves MORE of the tail on stdout (path 66 -> 5 chars survive; 106 -> 45).  The symptom
#   therefore gets less alarming as the defect gets worse, which is why it read as 8 ordinary fixture
#   failures for a whole sitting.  Every other sbl caller in scripts/ is safe TODAY only because it does
#   not use this sink -- not because its paths are short.  Adopt this flag and you inherit the trap.
#   ✅ THE CURE IS ONE LINE AT THE CALL SITE: stage the program under a short name in the run directory
#   (`ln -sf "$src" "$RUN/f.sno"`) and hand the oracle `f.sno`, cwd in $RUN.  See run_one() in
#   test_snoflake_suite.sh.  Grading by error NUMBER also needs a NUMERIC compare: SPITBOL zero-pads to
#   three digits (`ERROR 042`) where SCRIP does not (`Error 42`), so `[ "$a" = "$b" ]` silently misses
#   every error below 100.

# ⭐ THE ONE AUTHORITY for the SPITBOL oracle's BINARY (s row `clean-oracle-build`).  Lon's FACT RULE
# (2026-08-22, in-chat): "For benchmarking we should use only the official SPITBOL from the x64 repo at
# the SPITBOL GitHub."  The repo's checked-in `x64/bin/sbl` is INSTRUMENTED -- it carries a monitor IPC
# bridge (sysmc/sysml/sysmv/sysmr/sysmw/pmcll/pmext/pmred/pmfal fire-points, ~130 lines over upstream)
# that is NOT part of official SPITBOL.  MEASURED (callgrind Ir, matched `-bf` flags, cross-validated via
# an independent same-toolchain rebuild of the full fork tree landing within 7 instructions of the
# checked-in binary): the monitor fire-points cost ~2.2-2.3x the instruction count on statement/store-
# dense code even with MONITOR_READY_PIPE/MONITOR_GO_PIPE unset -- documented as "negligible overhead"
# but empirically NOT, most likely an uncached per-fire env-var check.  This binary is a from-source
# build of official upstream (github.com/spitbol/spitbol, HEAD 4fe74db) plus exactly two ALLOW-LISTED
# compatibility patches (Lon's amendment, same session): the uppercase-keyword/datatype-name table
# conversion + matching flc/flstg fold-direction reversal (so `-bf` accepts SCRIP-convention uppercase
# keywords), and the NS-TIME clock fix to osint/systm.c (s249, Lon in-chat, CLOCK_MONOTONIC not
# CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID).  NO monitor instrumentation, NO LOAD/UNLOAD ABI rework (that subsystem was
# classified UNKNOWN/deferred, not needed for the 15 top-level benchmark kernels, and is NOT minor).
# Proven: nm/strings show zero monitor symbols; patched-vs-pure-upstream Ir delta is 0.0067%, fully
# one-time (does not scale with iteration count); all 15 corpus/benchmarks/snobol4 kernels' deterministic
# `check:` output matches x64/bin/sbl exactly.  Full measurement in
# FINDING-2026-08-22-seat2-clean-oracle-monitor-overhead.md.
#
# ⛔ CALLERS MUST REFUSE, NOT FALL BACK -- same law as sbl_lang_flags above.  This path is OUTSIDE every
# tracked repo (built alongside its upstream source clone, both living outside the seat-root workspace so
# neither is ever discovered as a repo by tooling that walks S4E_HOME); a caller that cannot find it must
# say so loudly, never silently substitute x64/bin/sbl.
# ⛔⛔ THE -f CAPABILITY ASSERTION (hq_P s259, row `oracle-bin-sbl-trap`).  MEASURED: three SPITBOL binaries on
# this box -- `spitbol-clean/bin/sbl` (before it was repointed), `spitbol-fork-rebuilt/bin/sbl` and
# `spitbol-upstream/bin/sbl`, all byte-identical -- DO NOT SUPPORT `-f`.  Handed the MANDATORY `-bf` they answer
# "No END statement found in source file(s)." to EVERY program, including a two-line one that plainly has an END.
# A harness pointed at one of them prints a full, plausible, ENTIRELY FALSE all-FAIL table -- the exact class
# CLAUDE.md records this project hitting in three separate sessions.
# ⭐ WHY IT IS STRUCTURAL AND WILL COME BACK: a SPITBOL source tree SHIPS a prebuilt `bin/sbl` as BASEBOL, the
# BOOTSTRAP compiler; `make spitbol` consumes it and writes the real product to the TOP LEVEL as `./sbl`.  In our
# `x64/` fork `bin/sbl` IS the product.  The two layouts disagree, so the natural generalisation "the oracle is
# <root>/bin/sbl" lands EXACTLY on the trap.  Documentation cannot fix that; a capability check can.
# ⛔ THE RULE THIS ENCODES: an oracle is not a PATH, it is a BINARY THAT ACCEPTS `-bf`.  Never assemble a path.

# ⛔⛔ NAMING, CORRECTED BY LON s259 ("What is spitbol-upstream, is the pristine version? ... What is upstream mean?").
# "UPSTREAM" IS A GIT WORD, NOT A QUALITY WORD: it names the project you forked FROM (github.com/spitbol/spitbol),
# as opposed to `origin`, your own fork (snobol4ever/x64).  It says PROVENANCE and says NOTHING about whether the
# binary in that tree can serve as an oracle -- and the one shipped there CANNOT (no `-f`).
# ⭐ MEASURED, and it inverts the old names: `spitbol-upstream` had **0 modified files** -- it was the genuinely
# pristine one -- while `spitbol-clean` has **4** (the two allow-listed patches).  THE NAME "clean" WAS THE LIE.
# Renamed by ROLE s259, compatibility symlinks left at both old names so nothing in flight breaks:
#   spitbol-pristine/      <- was spitbol-upstream       untouched reference SOURCE. ⛔ NOT an oracle: its shipped
#                                                        bin/sbl is the BASEBOL bootstrap and rejects `-bf`.

# SILENTLY REWARDS one -- a seat that cloned x64 into its root would grade green against its own private copy and never learn it had diverged from everyone else.  A missing shared oracle must be LOUD.
# A per-root clone is also a permanent handoff_status.sh blocker the moment it takes a local commit, since that script adopts every directory in the root that is a git repo with an origin remote.

# needed for the 15 top-level benchmark kernels -- none of which call LOAD).  Fixing that subsystem is
# out of scope here.  What IS in scope: a benchmark timing a LOAD()-calling program against this binary
# must REFUSE LOUDLY, never silently print a number of unknown validity -- same "CALLERS MUST REFUSE,
# NOT FALL BACK" law as the two functions above, applied to program CONTENT instead of binary ABSENCE.
# Usage: sbl_clean_refuse_if_load "$path/to/prog.sno" || exit 3   (grep, not a parse -- LOAD as a bare

# scripts/*.sh` turns up at least four DIFFERENT hand-assembled roots across Icon board/bench
# scripts (icon-build, icon-master, work/icon-master/icon-master, refs/icon-master) plus bare
# `icont`/`iconx` trusted on PATH -- each script guessing independently, most with no existence
# check at all before use.  A wrong or absent guess is SILENT: the harness prints a full,
# plausible, entirely FALSE all-FAIL table (the same class sbl_correctness_bin() above exists to
# prevent), never a loud refusal.
# ⛔ CALLERS MUST REFUSE, NOT FALL BACK -- same law as every accessor above.  A missing icont/iconx
# must be LOUD on stderr with a non-zero return, never a silent empty string a caller can string-
# concat into a broken command line.
# Canonical shared build (verified executable this session): /home/resources/icon-master/bin/{icont,iconx}.
# ⭐ CORRECTED s266 by hq_C, who created it: /home/resources/icon-build is NOT a separate tree -- it is a
# SYMLINK to /home/resources/icon-master (`ls -ld` says so). The md5s match because they are the same file,
# so the divergent-shared-oracle hazard flagged here cannot occur by construction: there is nothing to
# rebuild independently. ⛔ DO NOT "fix" this by deleting the symlink -- several Icon scripts default their
# oracle to "$S4A/icon-build" (honest_icon_correctness.sh, scorecard_icon.sh ORACLE_BIN), and removing it
# breaks them while these accessors are still being adopted. The symlink exists precisely so those callers
# resolve to the one canonical tree instead of guessing. ⭐ The original note's instinct was right and worth
# keeping in spirit -- two oracle paths IS the hazard shape, and it deserved the flag; what makes it safe
# here is that one path is a link to the other, which `ls -l` answers and md5 cannot.
