# test_gate_pl_setup_call_cleanup_runs_its_cleanup_on_every_road.sh -- setup_call_cleanup/3 runs its cleanup as swipl does on every
# road out of G: a deterministic exit (at once), a nondeterministic exit (not yet), G's exhaustion, a ball raised inside G, a ball
# raised after a nondeterministic exit (G's bindings undone to the construct's mark, S's kept), and the cut, the if-then-else commit,
# the negation, once/1, a catch/3 goal's cut and an inline call/1's cut that drop G's choices -- with the cleanup goal a heap term that
# survives every forced collection while its record is PENDING. Row prolog-logtalk-setup-call-cleanup-3-runs-cleanup-at-the-first-exit-
# of-a-nondeterministic-goal (cto 2026-10-09); the design and its reviews are in the row's baton.
#
# THE WITNESSES AND THEIR REFS, cut from swipl 9.0.4: scripts/fixtures/hb_pl_setup_call_cleanup_runs_its_cleanup_on_every_road.pl
# (eighteen shapes; none prints a variable's name or depends on swipl's last-solution determinism of member/2) and
# scripts/gc_witnesses/hb_pl_setup_call_cleanup_pending_record_survives_collections.pl (a cut in the clause, a cut in the caller,
# exhaustion and a ball after a redo, each three times, the cleanup summing a 50-element list it holds while garbage is made).
# ARMS: (1) mode 3 and (2) mode 4 equal the first ref; (3)-(6) the second ref in mode 3 and mode 4 at a 64 KB window under SCRIP_GC_STRESS=1 and 3 with
# SCRIP_GC_CHAIN_CHECK=3, reading bad-link 0, offchain-swept 0, mismatch 0 and missing 0 beside the answer (hq_collector's condition:
# the record's C is visited through the retained frame by the chain, not by the marker scan STEP B removes).
# FAIL_ONCE=1 grades the first witness against a ref with its first cleanup line removed, so arms 1 and 2 must red.
