# util_call_by_name_census.sh -- CENSUS + RANK EVERY CALL-BY-STRING-NAME RUNTIME DISPATCH SITE.
# Row: perf-call-by-name-census-and-rank (hq_P, 2026-08-27). ONE DISEASE: a runtime mechanism
# reached through a generic string-keyed lookup (hash/strcmp/table scan) on every use, where a
# direct or cached reference would do -- measured three unrelated times in one day before this
# row existed (see .github/FINDING-2026-08-27-seat04-call-by-name-census-and-rank.md).
#
# WHAT THIS DOES, fresh every run (never reads a frozen snapshot):
#   1. Confirms every enumerated site's symbol still exists in the runtime source (a renamed or
#      deleted function makes the census REFUSE for that row rather than silently reporting stale
#      zeros -- FACT RULE: a watermark's command must still describe the tree it runs on).
#   2. Builds roman.sno's fixed-N=20000 timed twin (bench_wrap.sh --mode=iter, the project's
#      standard witness -- every cited FINDING in this cluster uses it) and profiles it with
#      profile_box_histogram.sh SIMS=0 (Ir-only; RULES.md: rank by Ir at fixed work, never
#      wall-clock/cycles -- this project measured cycle-derived numbers flip sign under FLEET
#      contention the same day).
#   3. Extracts each site's CURRENT attributable Ir from that one profile, ranks them, and prints
#      one table. A site the witness doesn't exercise is reported UNEXERCISED, never as zero cost.
#   4. Refuses (rc=2), never skips-as-success, when the compiler isn't built, the witness is
#      missing, or a cited symbol has vanished from the source it is supposed to describe.
#
# WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO: cure anything. This is a census-and-rank row, not an umbrella -- cures are
# child rows (RULES.md NO-PER-OP-FILTER's row-factory discipline). See the FINDING for the ranked
# recommendation list and which sites already have child rows landed/open/newly minted.
