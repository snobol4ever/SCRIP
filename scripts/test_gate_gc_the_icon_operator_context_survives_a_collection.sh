#   cfo 2026-09-26, row gc-core-gc-roots-visits-g-icn-op-s-two-descrs-at-core-c-397-the-last-open-holder-of-the-
#   conservative-auditor (ceo CEO-1289/1291). The conservative auditor's last OPEN holder, measured NOT latent.
#
# WHAT IT GATES.  g_icn_op (core.c) is the Icon operator context a traceback prints: core_icn_op_ctx stores the
# operator and its two operand DESCRs, core_icn_traceback prints them.  No root walk visited them.  icn_field_get and
# rt_field_var_strict (pattern_match.c) set it under &error and return failure without clearing it, so the context of
# a CONVERTED error survives into later code, and the next uncaught error prints it.  Any collection in between moved
# the operand and the traceback read its old ground: on 5d878bfbd, with NO environment at all, the natural witness
# died SIGSEGV in m3 (5 of 5) and printed "{record record_6309217648(0) . field}" in m4 (3 of 3, garbage varying
# per run); under SCRIP_GC_PLANT_FLIP=1 [ZGC-STALE] named "the holder of this pointer was NEVER VISITED".  The cure is
# the CTO-173 errorvalue precedent: two rt_gc_visit_descr calls in core_gc_roots, beside g_icn_errvalue.  A root
# visit, never a pin (ARCH-GC-COMPILE-TIME-FRAME-MAPS.md section 7).
#
# ⛔ WHY A PLANT AND NOT ONLY THE FOUND WITNESS (CEO-554, CEO-576).  The natural carrier is an Icon traceback defect
# in its own right -- iconx names {1 to 3 by 0} where we name the stale field operation -- and hq_icon holds that row.
# The day it is cured the natural witness stops holding a context across a collection and every arm built on it
# goes quietly untrippable.  So the holder is also reached through a seam that does not depend on any site's clear:
#   SCRIP_GC_PLANT_ICN_OP=1  HOLD        core_icn_op_ctx_clear and core_icn_bi_push leave the context set
#   SCRIP_GC_PLANT_ICN_OP=2  HOLD+UNROOT core_gc_roots also skips the two visits: the pre-cure defect, on purpose
# The seam prints "[GC-ICNOP] plant:" once per process, and that line is the only proof it applied.  INERT, measured
# at landing in the CEO-554 order: the build WITHOUT the seam was captured first (all 75 gc_witnesses programs, the
# shipped arena and 128 KB at stress 3, rc + stdout md5 + stderr md5 + collections, 437,866 collections in all), then
# the seam build with the variable unset: 0 of 150 runs differed on any column, and the capture itself was
# deterministic run to run on one build.
#
# ARMS.  References are the witnesses' own ZERO-COLLECTION answers (64 MB window, stress 0, collections=0 checked),
# because SCRIP's error format is not iconx's; the plant witness's unplanted answer is additionally anchored on the
# live oracle's traceback line.  A run PASSES when rc=1 (Icon's error exit), its output minus the plants' banner
# lines equals the reference, and no [ZGC-STALE] line appears.
#   (o)  the plant witness, unplanted, ends its traceback with the live oracle's last line
#   (z)  the references: collections=0 at 64 MB; the plant witness under HOLD prints the held field context (else this
#        gate REFUSES -- the carrier is gone, re-anchor it; that is a countdown named, not hidden)
#   (a)  the natural witness, unplanted, m3 and m4: the shipped defaults (the arm that crashed), the flip plant at the
#        shipped window, and a 128 KB window at stress 64 with and without the flip plant
#   (b)  the plant witness under HOLD, the same four arms in both modes: the visit keeps a held operand valid
#   (c)  FAIL-ONCE, the negation of (b)'s own predicate: under HOLD+UNROOT the flip plant at the shipped window must
#        FAIL it in both modes (measured: m3 SIGSEGV 10 of 10 with ASLR on and off, m4 a garbage record 10 of 10); and
#        at the zero-collection window HOLD+UNROOT must PASS it, so the failure is the missing visit and not the HOLD
#   (d)  core_gc_roots visits g_icn_op.a and g_icn_op.b
#   (e)  REPORTED: whether the natural carrier still exists (the stale-context leak hq_icon's row cures)
# ⛔ STRESS 1 IS NOT AN ARM HERE: 200,001 collections, 15-23 s a run at load 27; the flip plant at the shipped window
# moves every live block at each of its ~78 collections in ~0.3 s and discriminates in both modes.  At 128 KB stress 64
# the HOLD+UNROOT read can land on ground the operand occupies again (m3 read it correctly), so it is graded only
# for the cure, never as the fail-once.
