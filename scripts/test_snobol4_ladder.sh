# test_snobol4_ladder.sh -- THE CONSTRUCT-LADDER RUNNER for SNOBOL4 (GOAL-TEST-SUITE-CONSISTENCY.md standard point 1;
# row snobol4-construct-ladder-from-rung-0-with-trace-refs, seat12). Minted by hq_T 2026-09-03 from the ONE shared body lib_ladder.sh, which
# is test_prolog_ladder.sh's and test_raku_ladder.sh's body extracted once for all seven languages.
#   --to N     grade rungs 0..N CUMULATIVELY (default: every rung the master carries)
#   --only N   grade rung N ALONE -- the rung under construction, while the rungs below it are still red.
#              Mutually exclusive with --to: a request naming both REFUSES rc=2 rather than guessing.
#   --list     print the witnesses per rung and exit 0 without grading
# POPULATION: every origin `ladder__rungNN_<slug>` of corpus/tests/snobol4/ALL.csv with NN <= N, materialized OUT of
# the master by origin through lib_master_extract.sh (MASTER_DIR=corpus/tests/snobol4, MASTER_EXT=.sno) -- keyed on
# the CSV `origin` column, never on the entry name and never on a filename glob.
# EACH WITNESS RUNS ALONE IN BOTH MODES:  m3 = scrip --run  ·  m4 = scrip --compile -o x.s + as --64 + gcc -no-pie + run
# Verdict per witness per mode: stdout byte-equal to the .ref AND rc equal to the declared rc (ALL.wantrc, keyed
# on the entry NAME; default 0). A timeout is a FAIL(rc=124), never a hang.
# ⭐ THE ORACLE THAT MUST CUT THIS LANGUAGE'S REFS: the SPITBOL oracle `/home/resources/x64/bin/sbl`, ALWAYS with `-bf` (`sbl_correctness_bin()` in
# lib_oracle_flags.sh) -- plain `-b` manufactures phantom duplicate labels and walks into a crashing error path.
# ⛔ STATE OF THIS LADDER (hq_T 2026-09-04, re-measured): rungs 0-9 are LANDED -- ten witnesses,
# `ladder__rung00_hello` .. `ladder__rung09_pattern_capture`, `--to 9` PASS 20/20 both modes, refs oracle-cut
# from `sbl -bf`. ⚠️ This header said "carries ZERO `ladder__rung*` origins, so this runner correctly REFUSES
# rc=2" from the day the runner was minted until 2026-09-04 -- true when written, stale within hours of the
# rungs landing, and it is the runner's OWN header that is likeliest to be believed about its own state.
# The port-trace instrument over these same rungs is `test_gate_sno_port_trace.sh`.
# EXIT: 0 every graded witness PASS in both modes · 1 any FAIL · 2 REFUSED (cannot measure).

# ⭐ THE BODY IS SHARED: every language's ladder runner is this stanza over lib_ladder.sh, which carries the
# interface, the population rule, the grading and the printed shape ONCE for all seven (row
# test-suite-consistency-seven-languages-one-standard, hq_T 2026-09-03). Only the three tokens below vary.
