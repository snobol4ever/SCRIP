# test_gate_snocone_beauty_suite_reads_every_test_in_both_modes_with_no_xfail.sh -- THE SNOCONE BEAUTY SUITE, GRADED EVERY BUILD
#
# LON 2026-09-23 15:4x CDT, in-chat to the ceo, verbatim: "Get snocone beauty test suite working first." (row snocone-the-beauty-
# test-suite-reads-twenty-of-twenty-in-both-modes-with-no-xfail-marker-lons-first, CEO-1212). THE SUITE is the banner-block container
# corpus/tests/snocone/beauty_modules.sc + .ref: the Snocone beauty subsystem tests of SC-19..SC-22 (test_Gen .. test_tree), each a
# driver over the bootstrap runtime it names. This gate runs it through the harness in BOTH modes and is GREEN only when every test
# passes in m3 AND m4 and neither file carries an XFAIL banner (an xfail counts as a fail, RULES.md FACT RULE; the Snocone lane bans it).
#
# ⛔ WHY THIS FILE REPLACES TWO RUNNERS. It is test_beauty_snocone_all_modes.sh renamed and rewritten; its sibling
# test_beauty_snocone_subsystems.sh was deleted in the same commit. Both read corpus/snocone/demo/snobol4/beauty/test, a directory the
# 2026-08-29 corpus re-grid removed, so from that day the suite was graded by NOTHING: the first skipped every subsystem (and later
# refused), the second skipped every name it was given. The tests were folded into the container; one runner over the container is
# the whole grader, and a single named test is `corpus_suite_harness.py extract <container> <ref> test_<name> <out>` and run.
# ⛔ WHY A test_gate_ NAME: only a test_gate_*.sh is in util_gate_wiring.py's population, so only a gate is held by the wiring floor.
# A suite that went ungraded for three weeks because its runner pointed at a dead path is precisely what the floor exists to stop.
#
# FAIL-ONCE, MEASURED 2026-09-23 by hq_snocone on ONE binary through the zd-planner killswitches: SCRIP_ZD_REPL_FREE=0 reds test_Qize
# and test_case, SCRIP_ZD_OBACK=0 reds test_strings and test_trace, SCRIP_ZD_MATCHDIAMOND=0 reds test_trace -- each a SIGSEGV or a
# wrong answer in both modes -- so `SCRIP_ZD_OBACK=0 bash $0` must print RED. It grades output against the refs, never rc alone.
