# test_gate_gc_a_no_layout_entry_names_which_of_the_two_populations_it_is_in.sh -- CEO-1025 MADE MECHANICAL, AND ITS
# DISCRIMINATOR CORRECTED ON THE DATA (cto 2026-09-20, MODE TENET; ruling CEO-1025 on hq_prolog's fork).
#
# THE RULING: `no_layout` CONFLATES TWO POPULATIONS WITH OPPOSITE OWNERS.  (a) THE COMPILER REFUSED THE ENTRY --
# nothing emitted, no leaf boundary, no store: a COMPLETENESS debt wearing a GC census's clothes, declared with its
# rung, counted inside the printed denominator, and it gates NO language's completeness under MODE TENET condition
# 1.  (b) THE COMPILER EMITTED THE GRAPH AND THE PLANNER GAVE IT NO FRAME LAYOUT -- boundaries exist and store into
# unmapped slots BY CONSTRUCTION: the cfo's clause, the correctness population, and it DOES gate completeness.
#
# ⛔ THE RULING NAMED `rc=2` AGAINST `rc=1` AS THE SPLIT AND THE DATA SAYS OTHERWISE, WHICH IS WHY THIS GATE GRADES
# THE FACT AND NOT THE rc.  Measured 2026-09-20 over all seven masters: prolog's ten read `rc=2 builtin X is not on
# the ladder yet`, and raku's seven read `rc=1 raku parse error` / `lex error` / a role-composition refusal.  BOTH
# ARE REFUSALS THAT EMIT NOTHING.  So rc=1 against rc=2 separates a LADDER refusal from a PARSER refusal -- two
# flavours inside bucket (a) -- and not (a) from (b).  The fact the ruling asked for is DID THIS ENTRY PRODUCE
# EMITTED CODE AT ALL, and the census has always known it directly: a non-zero rc from --dump-zeta is
# NEVER-EMITTED, rc=0 with no frame layout in the dump is EMITTED-NO-LAYOUT, and a timeout is UNMEASURED and is
# folded into neither.  The kind travels as a VALUE from the one place that runs the compiler and is never re-parsed
# out of the message text, because a guard keyed on a spelling is a coincidence and not a guard.
#
# ⭐ THE FLEET READING AT THE LANDING, so nobody re-derives it: 4907 graded, no_layout=18, NEVER-EMITTED=18,
# EMITTED-NO-LAYOUT=0 -- prolog 10, raku 7, snobol4 1, and icon/snocone/pascal/rebus zero.  THE CORRECTNESS
# POPULATION IS EMPTY ACROSS THE FLEET, so `no_layout` gates no language's completeness today.  ⛔ THAT IS NOT A
# CLEAN COLLECTOR AND MUST NOT BE READ AS ONE: hq_raku's 36 programs that answer wrong at SCRIP_GC_STRESS=16 are in
# NEITHER bucket -- those graphs emit, run, exit 0 and print a plausible wrong answer, which is the class itself.
# This gate is HERMETIC and runs the stubs below rather than the masters, because the seven-language sweep costs
# minutes and MODE TENET condition 2 charges that to ten seats through an essentially serial set.

# ⛔ A GRAPH CAN EMIT, REGISTER A FRAME MAP, AND HAVE NO LAYOUT ENTRY IN IT.  frame_bytes=64 header_bytes=48 with
# FLAT_FRAME_ALLOWANCE 48+16 leaves a value region of exactly ZERO BYTES.  Such a graph is NOT no_layout -- it has
# a map, so it counts inside graphs= and graded= -- and it contributes 0 to fields= and 0 to holes=, so a hole
# census reads it as perfect.  hq_raku's family was corrupt under every collection while
# test_gate_gc_raku_every_frame_slot_has_a_kind printed PASS over 19476 fields and 0 holes.  A ZERO OVER A
# DENOMINATOR OF ZERO, which is harder to notice than a zero over a small denominator because no field in the
# output moves.  MEASURED FLEET-WIDE AT THIS LANDING: 37 graphs -- raku 33 (hq_raku's own count, reached here by
# parsing --dump-zeta rather than by their per-entry map dump), snobol4 2, icon 2.
# ⛔⭐ A ZERO-BYTE REGION IS NOT BY ITSELF A DEFECT AND THIS GATE DOES NOT CALL IT ONE.  A graph with nothing live
# across a safe point has nothing to map: snobol4's two are `main` in simple_program_2 and simple_program_11.  THE
# CORRECTNESS QUESTION IS THE JOIN -- a zero-entry map in a graph that DOES shield a value at a safe point -- and
# that join is NOT BUILT YET (it needs this census's graph names against the unmapped-store census's per-graph
# shielded stores).  Named here as owed rather than counted as clean, which is this row's whole subject matter.
