# test_gate_s4e_one_process_per_identity.sh -- ONE PROCESS PER IDENTITY on the postoffice bus. Row
# bus-refuses-a-second-live-process-under-one-seat-identity (ceo ruling 2026-09-03, on hq_B's routing of seat11's
# measurement 16:40: /home/claude11 held TWO live claude processes at once -- an interactive session and a scheduled
# routine `claude --name Fleet #11 --model claude-sonnet-5 --effort max`, per .claude/scheduled_tasks.lock). LAW 6
# derives identity from the ROOT PATH, so both were seat11 to the bus: one $ME, one claim namespace, one inbox. The
# routine left SCRIP dirty mid-edit while the session closed a row, and a claim HIDES its row from the other picker
# -- so the race was silent from BOTH sides. Cure: s4e_msg.sh takes a (pid,starttime) lock at $PO/<seat>/.pid on
# every verb and REFUSES rc=2 naming BOTH pids when another LIVE process holds the identity. hq_B 2026-09-03.
# SIX ARMS against a THROWAWAY postoffice under mktemp -- never the live one:
#   (1) CONCURRENT  two GENUINELY concurrent verbs under one S4E_HOME (a background `done` whose DONE-WHEN sleeps,
#                   holding the lock, while `check` runs): the second REFUSES rc=2 and NAMES BOTH PIDS -- the
#                   incumbent pid matching the real background process -- while the incumbent still completes rc=0.
#   (2) RELEASE     a verb that exits normally leaves NO lock behind, and the next verb succeeds.
#   (3) STALE       a lock naming a DEAD pid self-clears; the verb runs.
#   (4) RECYCLED    ⛔ THE FALSE-REFUSAL ARM. A lock naming a LIVE pid whose STARTTIME differs is a recycled pid,
#                   NOT the holder -- it must self-clear. A pid-only lock refuses a seat that is alone in its root,
#                   i.e. the guard manufacturing the exact false signal it exists to remove.
#   (5) TORN        an empty/garbled lock file never wedges the bus.
#   (6) NESTED      ⛔ THE SELF-DEADLOCK ARM. s4e_msg.sh calls ITSELF eight times -- `ask` EXECS into `send` (same
#                   pid, same starttime, trap thrown away by exec), `board`/`done` spawn a `banner` child, `mint`
#                   installs its OWN EXIT trap and then clears it. Every one must succeed AND leave no lock behind.
# FAIL-ONCE (INSTRUMENT LAWS): two mutated copies, each removing one half of the cure --
#   M1 drops the s4e_pid_acquire call  -> arm (1) must go red.   M2 makes liveness pid-only -> arm (4) must go red.
# EXIT 0 all six arms hold on the live script AND both mutants go red; 1 otherwise; 2 REFUSED (fixture unbuildable).
