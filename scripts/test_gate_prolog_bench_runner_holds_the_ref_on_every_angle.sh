# test_gate_prolog_bench_runner_holds_the_ref_on_every_angle.sh -- THE PROLOG BENCHMARK RUNNER FAILS WHAT A SINGLE-RUN TEST WOULD PASS.
#
# test_prolog_bench_suite.sh grades each kernel under three angles in both modes (the process wrapper on the pristine kernel, then the
# programs bench_prolog_wrap.sh generates: fixed iterations and fixed time), the REF checked on every run -- in the iteration angle as
# N copies of the REF (loop_check), in the time angle as the answer once with every repetition held == to it (row prolog-benchmarks-
# double-as-tests-..., hq_prolog, CEO-1221; the Rebus twin is test_gate_rebus_bench_runner_holds_the_ref_on_every_angle.sh). Lon,
# verbatim: "The reason to force a benchmark to also be a test is to guarantee it is not vacuous." This gate plants a fixture OUTSIDE
# the corpus tree (not a board, CEO-547: graded, nothing appended, nothing written) and requires the verdicts to be exactly:
#   good   nrev copied from the corpus with its REF                     -> PASS in m3 and m4
#   drift  a kernel whose value moves every call: its first answer IS its REF, so the process angle PASSES, and the iteration and
#          time angles FAIL (LOOP-OUTPUT-MISMATCH, bench__mismatch) -- the case a one-run test grades green
#   badref fib beside a wrong REF                                      -> FAIL on all three angles
# and the board line all_pass=1 all_n=3. Needs the build (it runs scrip in both modes); a few seconds at BENCH_BUD_MS=50.
