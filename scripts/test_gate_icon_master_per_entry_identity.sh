# test_gate_icon_master_per_entry_identity.sh — THE ICON MASTER GRADED BY PER-ENTRY IDENTITY, NOT BY A FLOOR.
# Authors: LCherryholmes · Claude Opus 5   DATE: 2026-09-06   (row icon-master-board-grades-per-entry-identity-not-a-floor)
#
# ⛔⭐⭐ THE MEASURED INCIDENT THIS EXISTS TO KILL. `board_icon_master.sh` scores the master with a PASS FLOOR.
# On 2026-09-04 that floor stood at 596 while the tree carried 601 passes; two programs then regressed
# (procedure_write_image_1, procedure_record_every_replace_2), the board fell 601 -> 599, and it printed
# "watermarks held" — because 599 is still above 596 — and then INVITED A RE-PIN at the lower number. Every
# arm of that behaved exactly as written. The defect is the instrument: a floor scores a SET BY A SCALAR, so
# it cannot distinguish "the same 599 entries pass" from "599 pass, but not the same 599". hq_T states the
# general form as a three-member rule — pinned population, carried max, floor — and a single number carries
# at most one of the three.
#
# ⛔ AND THE WORST CASE IS NOT A DROP, IT IS A SWAP. Two entries regress while two others get cured in the
# same window and the count NEVER MOVES. A floor is silent by construction; so is a watermark; so is any
# delta. Only per-entry identity can see it, and the cure that hid behind the swap is indistinguishable from
# a clean day in every board this project has ever printed.
#
# WHAT THIS GATE DOES, AND THE ONE THING IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT.
#   It pins, per (entry, mode), the outcome the tree already holds, and REDS when a pinned PASS stops passing
#   or a pinned entry stops being graded at all. It does NOT red on the reverse — an entry that starts passing
#   is reported and asked to be re-pinned in the commit that earned it. Growth needs no re-pin (RULES.md § the
#   denominator law); a regression needs a verdict.
#
# ⛔⭐ THE BASELINE IS KEYED ON `origin`, NOT ON THE ENTRY NAME, AND THAT IS NOT A DETAIL. The suite builder
# RENUMBERS entries (`procedure_10`, `directive_82`) every time the master is rebuilt, and ALL.csv names
# `origin` as the durable provenance key for exactly that reason. A baseline keyed on the display name would
# go mass-VANISHED plus mass-NEW on the next rebuild — a wall of false red that trains its reader to re-pin
# without looking, which is the floor's own failure with more steps.
#
# ⛔ AST-GRADED ENTRIES ARE PINNED FOR POPULATION AND REPORTED FOR OUTCOME, NEVER RED ON OUTCOME. Their .ref
# is SCRIP's own past self-dumped AST (ast-dump-refs-are-self-pins-not-oracles): no oracle emits SCRIP's AST
# shape, so a drift there means RE-DECIDE THE SHAPE AND REGENERATE, never "a program broke". But a vanished
# ast entry IS red like any other — losing a fixture from the population is a coverage loss whoever grades it.
#
# ⛔ IT NEVER TOUCHES THE LIVE PROGRESS TABLE. The run records its per-entry rows to a SCRATCH S4E_PROGRESS_DB,
# which is the documented control arm in util_progress_append.py ("gates use a scratch file; the live table is
# never touched by a gate"). It also writes NO SCORE.md cell: under CEO-308 the icon board cell is owned by
# `board_icon_master.sh` and a second runner over a second population writing that cell is the exact defect
# CEO-308 ruled on. This gate is a control arm, and control arms live in the ledger.
#
# CONTROL ARMS (all announce themselves; none can quietly produce a green):
#   FAIL_ONCE=1 [or FAIL_ONCE=<origin>]  inject ONE pinned-PASS entry as FAIL after the real run and re-grade.
#                                        Proves the comparison can say no. REFUSES rc=2 if the injection does
#                                        not register — an identity gate that cannot fail on an injected red
#                                        entry is the floor defect wearing a new name, which is this row.
#   ICON_IDENTITY_MEASURED_FROM=<tsv>    grade an ALREADY-MEASURED progress table instead of running the suite.
#   ICON_IDENTITY_BASELINE=<tsv>         grade against a different pin (used by the fail-once proof in a scratch).
#   --repin                              rewrite the baseline FROM A RUN. Never from typing; see cmd_pin_ref's
#                                        rule in the harness — text typed by hand is a claim about behaviour,
#                                        output from a run is evidence of it.
