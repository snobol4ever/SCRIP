# ONE SCRATCH DEMO TREE (outside every corpus checkout), graded by test_demos_suite.sh snobol4:

#   d/noref.sno   no .ref: FAIL, counted and named, never skipped  lib/util.sno declared in CONTAINERS.tsv: out of the population
#   e/linked.icn  a link manifest into the mirrored packages root (its statements end in ';', as SCRIP Icon requires since c299b8a03)  f/chained.sno  a .chain sidecar: concatenated after library/gate_unit.sno
# ARMS: (1) the board line reads total=6 all_pass=4 m3_pass=4 m4_pass=4 containers=1 workhorse_declared=1 chained=1; (2) the reds are named,
# the no-ref one as no-ref; (3) the progress rows land in a scratch table as class benchmark, suite snobol4-demos, keyed demos/snobol4/<r>,
# one per program and mode (12 rows, the container none); (4) the fixture tree is never written as a suite row; (5)-(8) the workhorse
# reader: a valid sidecar echoes stdin/scale/argv, and an unknown key, a missing stdin file and a zero scale each REFUSE rc 2;
# (9)-(12) the chain reader: a present unit echoes its path, and a missing unit, a blank line and an absolute path each REFUSE rc 2.
# FAILED ONCE: arms (1)-(4) need the runner, which did not exist before this landing; (5)-(8) the reader likewise; (1) and (3) with the
# runner's concatenation line replaced by a no-op (the chained demo reads m3=FAIL,m4=FAIL, 12 rows with two FAIL), 2026-09-27.
# EXIT 0 every arm holds; 1 an arm is red; 2 REFUSED (the fixture could not be built).
