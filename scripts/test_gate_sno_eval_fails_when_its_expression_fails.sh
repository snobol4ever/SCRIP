#!/usr/bin/env bash
# test_gate_sno_eval_fails_when_its_expression_fails.sh -- EVAL(expr) must FAIL when the expression fails or
# raises, not quietly return the null string.
#
# ⛔ THE DEFECT (ceo 2026-09-14, found in the x64 tests' own exception harness, chks.inc). eval_string_transient
# reported success whenever the chain RAN, and read the result out of the EVAL temp. An expression that FAILED
# never wrote that temp, so EVAL handed back the leftover empty value with a success indication: SQRT(-1.0)
# and 1/0 both "succeeded" as the null string. A SYNTAX error did fail, because the chain could not be built --
# so the one case anyone tests by hand was the one case that worked.
#
# ⭐ WHAT IT COST, AND WHY IT IS WORTH A GATE RATHER THAN A FIX: chks.inc grades every x64 math program by
# EVAL-ing an expression and comparing the observed answer, with a `:F(chks.oops)` branch that reads &ERRTEXT.
# With EVAL never failing, that branch was UNREACHABLE for a whole suite -- the harness silently compared the
# null string to the expected answer, and 10 of the 16 m3 reds were math_* programs stacked on this one root.
# math_ln went from CRASH to 627 pass / 0 fail on the cure alone.
#
# ⛔ THE SHAPE TO REMEMBER: the fail path was not wrong, it was NOT TAKEN. A harness whose error branch can
# never run reports every error as a wrong answer, which reads as dozens of unrelated numeric defects.
#
# The expectations are what SPITBOL does: a failing expression makes EVAL fail. NO ORACLE NEEDED AT RUN TIME --
# the arms assert the FAIL/SUCCEED branch taken, which is the property, not a formatted number.
# rc=0 clean · rc=1 a coercion of failure into success · rc=2 REFUSAL (cannot measure).
