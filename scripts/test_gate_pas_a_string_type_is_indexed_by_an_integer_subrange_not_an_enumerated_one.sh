# test_gate_pas_a_string_type_is_indexed_by_an_integer_subrange_not_an_enumerated_one.sh -- ISO 7185 6.4.3.2: a string-type is a packed array [1..n] of char, n > 1; the index-type is a subrange of INTEGER (PAT iso7185prt1855).
#
# MEASURED 2026-10-08 by hq_pascal: PAT 1855 (`type enum = (one, two, three); sr = two..three; var s: packed array [sr] of char; ... s := 'ab'`) compiled and ran to rc 0; fpc -Miso refuses it. The ordinals of two..three are 1..2, and
# the string-type test in pascal.y asked only for a low bound of 1 and a high bound of at least 2, so an enumerated subrange that happens to start at ordinal 1 passed for 1..2. The parser kept a subrange as (name, low, high)
# and a constant as (name, value), so the enumerated origin was invisible by the time the array was built.
# CURE (pascal.y, with Lon's in-chat permission for ONE new parser global, 2026-10-08 ~23:5x CDT, verbatim: "Have your parser global."): g_pas_last_const_enum is set by scalar_constant (1 when the constant is an enumeration member, 0 for every
# other form); the enumeration rule marks its members in the constant table (isenum, a struct member); pas_subtype_add records the flag on the named subrange it registers (isenum, a struct member); the one-dimensional array rule
# takes the index's enum-ness (pas_index_is_enum: the subrange just parsed, or the named subrange) through the same global into the string-type test, which then adds PAS_CA_NOSTR so the 6.4.3.2 diagnostic of PAT 1761-1765 applies.
#
# ARMS, both modes: three fault programs (PAT 1855's named subrange, the same subrange written inline in the array, a subrange of the first two members) must be REFUSED at compile time naming 6.4.3.2 with empty stdout; a control cut LIVE from
# fpc -Miso (a char array indexed by an enumerated subrange used element by element, by the enumeration itself, an integer array over the subrange, a genuine 1..2 string-type assigned a string, a 1..3 one) must run
# byte-identical. FAIL_ONCE=1 corrupts the control's ref.
