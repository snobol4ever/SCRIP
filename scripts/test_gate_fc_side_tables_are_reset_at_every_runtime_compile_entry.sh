# test_gate_fc_side_tables_are_reset_at_every_runtime_compile_entry.sh -- THE SIDE TABLES OF frame_layout.c ARE KEYED
# BY RAW IR NODE POINTER, AND A RUNTIME COMPILE'S FRESH NODES LAND ON FREED ADDRESSES (cto 2026-09-18, row
# rationale-frame-layout-c-remainder STEP 3; the claim is stated in .github/ARCH-FRAME-LAYOUT-FIXED-CELLS.md section 7,
# which says in as many words that no gate holds it).
#
# ⛔ WHAT SECTION 7 SAID, AND WHAT THE MEASUREMENT FOUND. The recovered rationale explains why fc_tables_reset exists:
# an EVAL chain, a CODE fragment or a runtime pattern tree lowers fresh IR whose nodes can land on a freed prior
# graph's addresses, and a stale hit once emitted one r12-viewed box inside an rsp-viewed blob and wrote over the C
# caller's frame (EVAL_fn's return address became 0x21). It then argues the OTHER tables are safe because "emission
# consults them only for the graph lowered since the reset, and all pre-reset graphs are already emitted", and it
# explains the asymmetry by saying the zls tables are not reset here either. BOTH HALVES WERE STALE AT HEAD:
#   * fc_tables_reset reset ONE counter of sixteen (fct_n, the tail candidates). Twelve pointer-keyed tables -- fca
#     fcab fcc fch fcm fcs fcv fpe fvb fvcl fvdj fvl fvr fvs fvw -- were never reset in the life of the process.
#   * all three runtime-compile entries (runtime_eval.c eval_build_chain and code_at, bb_pat_build.cpp
#     bb_compile_pat_tree_sz) ALREADY call zls_reset() wholesale on the line beside it. The zls tables ARE reset. So
#     the stated reason for the asymmetry did not describe the tree, and nothing else did either.
# ⭐ THE HAZARD IS REAL AND WAS MEASURED, NOT ARGUED (2026-09-18, a 300-distinct-runtime-compile SNOBOL4 EVAL witness,
# a temporary probe on the registrars, reverted): 615 registrations at 609 DISTINCT ADDRESSES -- six addresses were
# registered twice, by two different graphs, through recycled memory. On fvr, whose entries are a node-to-FRAME-POSITION
# map and whose lookup returns the FIRST match, two registrations found a live stale entry for their own address. In
# that witness the stale frame position happened to AGREE with the fresh one, so the answer was right: THE HAZARD WAS
# LIVE AND THE DAMAGE WAS LUCK. Nothing made them agree.
# ⛔ AND THE CAP WAS A PER-PROCESS BUDGET FOR A PER-GRAPH TABLE. Because nothing was reset, the counters climbed
# monotonically with the number of distinct runtime compiles: measured 310 (fvl) and 305 (fvr) after 300 compiles,
# one per compile, against caps of 2048 and 1024. A program with about a thousand distinct EVAL or CODE compiles
# therefore saturated fvr and silently lost the value-spine plan FOR THE REST OF THE PROCESS -- correct, because
# fc_vcap makes the planner refuse before the registrar's own backstop fires (measured: 3000 compiles, answer still
# exact, and fc_reg_full never printed), but permanently and progressively deoptimised with no diagnostic. The cure
# turns that per-process budget back into a per-compile one.
# ⭐ FAIL-ONCE, MEASURED ON A REAL TREE RATHER THAN ASSERTED: with fc_tables_reset resetting only fct_n, the same
# witness read fvl 310 / fvr 305; with the sixteen-counter reset it reads fvl 10 / fvr 5, and the answers of all four
# witnesses are byte-identical before and after.
#
# ⛔ THE ONE NAMED EXCLUSION, stated so arm 1 cannot read green by never looking: pz_n is NOT reset and must not be.
# The pz table is keyed by GRAPH NAME, not by node pointer, it updates an existing row in place rather than appending,
# and it is the patzeta pricing a later compile looks up BY NAME for a graph emitted earlier -- resetting it would
# throw away the price of every graph already emitted. Pointer keying is what makes a table unsafe across a compile;
# name keying is what makes this one necessary across it.
#
# ARMS (all blocking). (1) COVERAGE: every pointer-keyed counter declared in frame_layout.c appears in
# fc_tables_reset's body, with pz_n the one named exclusion, and the population is PRINTED so a reset that emptied
# reds instead of passing vacuously.
# ⛔ RE-KEYED 2026-09-25 (cfo, row compiler-every-population-table-grows-in-the-compile-time-arena-..., Lon 2026-09-24:
# "Use the special compile-time heap, and use alloc/copy/abandon at geometric growth for dynamic arrays and buffers."):
# thirteen of the sixteen counters (fca fcc fch fcm fcv fpe fvb fvcl fvdj fvl fvr fvs fvw) became KINDS of ONE
# generation-stamped node map, fcn_t in g_fcn, whose entries die with a generation bump rather than a counter zeroed;
# fcs and fcab were DELETED in the same landing (no caller in the tree), and fc_reg_full with its seen_n latch went with
# the caps it reported. So arm 1 reads two populations: the plain counters (fct_n today), each zeroed in the reset that
# owns it, and the map's kinds (the FCN_* flags), counted as covered ONLY when fc_tables_reset bumps g_fcn_gen, zeroes
# g_fcn_n and empties the arm vector g_fca. The floor is 14 = 16 minus exactly the two deleted tables; it is not
# lowered for anything that still exists. zls_reset is held the same way for g_znb (its generation bump). (2) CALL SITES: every site that calls zls_reset for a runtime compile also calls
# fc_tables_reset, and vice versa -- the two are a set, and an entry that resets one but not the other is exactly the
# shape this gate is about. (3) BOUNDEDNESS: 300 distinct runtime compiles keep every table's high water under a
# ceiling, read through the tree's own SCRIP_FC_REG_HIGHWATER reporter (no new global -- RULES.md). (4) ANSWER: the
# EVAL and CODE witnesses are graded against the SPITBOL oracle, in both media, because a bounded counter beside a
# wrong answer is not a cure.
