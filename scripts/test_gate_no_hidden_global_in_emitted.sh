# GATE: no visibility("hidden") global in the runtime may be NAMED IN EMITTED PROGRAM TEXT.
#
# WHY THIS GATE EXISTS (s214, 2026-07-29). g_cap_gen was promoted static -> visibility("hidden") so
# rtx_match.S could reach it. That is correct for a .S INSIDE libscrip_rt.so and WRONG for emitted
# mode-4 code OUTSIDE it: a hidden symbol is absent from the dynamic table, so the separately-linked
# mode-4 object cannot resolve it. 173 of 316 crosscheck programs failed to LINK. Mode 3 bakes the
# address in-process and is STRUCTURALLY INCAPABLE of expressing the failure, so the defect survived
# >=11 commits while every session reported m3 green.
#
# THREE VISIBILITY TIERS, NOT TWO -- ARCH s7 step 0(c) documents only the first column:
#     linkage   reachable from .S inside the .so   reachable from emitted mode-4 code
#     static                  no                              no
#     hidden                  YES                             NO   <-- the trap
#     default                 yes (via GOT)                   yes
#
# AND IF YOU EXPORT ONE, THE .so-INTERNAL ACCESSES MUST BECOME @GOTPCREL. A -no-pie executable takes
# a COPY RELOCATION and owns the storage; direct PC-relative access inside the .so would then be a
# DIFFERENT VARIABLE -- silent divergence, no diagnostic at any stage. ld refusing R_X86_64_PC32 on
# the shared-object side is the lucky half of that fix, not the whole of it.
#
# This gate is STATIC and runs in about a second, which is the point: the dynamic instrument that
# catches this class is the mode-4 crosscheck, and mode 4 is the expensive half that sessions skip.
# Exit 0 = clean. Exit 1 = a hidden global is named in emitted text.

# 1. Harvest hidden globals from the BUILT OBJECTS, not from source text. ELF is ground truth and is
#    immune to prose. ⛔ THE FIRST VERSION OF THIS GATE PARSED `grep visibility("hidden")` OVER THE .c
#    FILES AND IMMEDIATELY FALSE-POSITIVED ON ITS OWN FIX: the warning comment left on g_cap_gen's
#    declaration ("DO NOT re-add visibility(\"hidden\")") contains the very string the harvester
#    matched, so the gate reported the symbol it had just been written to protect. A gate that reads
#    prose inherits every defect prose has. Data only -- a hidden FUNCTION is a different question
#    (emitted code calls runtime functions through the PLT and those must be exported anyway, so a
#    hidden one fails loudly at link on the first program that reaches it).
