# test_gate_pas_a_file_component_is_never_itself_a_file.sh -- ISO 7185 6.4.3.5, refused at compile time
#
# MEASURED 2026-09-16 by hq_pascal on SCRIP 2f2b84d38, both modes, working row pascal-pat-suite-427-to-100-percent-by-class.
# TWO PAT rejection tests were ACCEPTED SILENTLY, rc=0 with no output: a file whose component-type is itself a file
# (1826, `file of file of integer`) and a file whose component-type is a record carrying a text field (1827). ISO 7185
# 6.4.3.5 forbids both -- the component-type of a file-type shall be neither a file-type nor a structured-type having a
# file-type as a component, at any depth.
#
# THE CURE, and why it costs nothing at run time: the Pascal record-type table recorded a per-field char flag but nothing
# about a field being a FILE, so `file of r` could not ask whether r carried one. The table now carries `fldfile`,
# staged in pas_pend_add exactly as fldchar is, set when the field's own type is a typed file, is `text`, or is a record
# the table already knows carries a file -- so the flag is transitive by construction rather than by a walk. The file-type
# production consults it, plus its own pending state for an INLINE component record. Every witness is decided in the
# parser; no generated code changes and no runtime check is added.
#
# ⛔ KNOWN LIMIT, NAMED RATHER THAN HIDDEN: a component reached only through an ARRAY OF a record that carries a file is
# caught (the array's element type name is the pending typename), but a component reached through a POINTER is not, and
# ISO 7185 does not require it to be -- a pointer to a file-bearing record is not itself a structured-type having a file
# as a component. No PAT witness exercises a deeper shape than these two.
#
# ARMS: the two vendored PAT witnesses, each required to be REFUSED with a non-empty diagnostic in BOTH modes -- the
# suite's own criterion. A third arm proves the cure DISCRIMINATES rather than refusing every file: a program declaring
# `file of integer`, `file of <a plain record>` and `text` side by side still compiles and runs, byte-identical to
# fpc -Miso. FAIL_ONCE=1 flips the first witness's expectation to prove the arm can fail.
