# test_gate_every_tree_kind_has_a_dump_name.sh -- EVERY tree_e KIND IN src/ir/ast.h HAS ITS NAME IN tt_e_name, SPELLED AS ITS
# ENUMERATOR (cfo 2026-09-29, row parser-sc-accuracy-...-ceo-1364; Lon 2026-09-27, verbatim: "Write a C function to dump the AST.
# Write an equivalent Snocone function to dump the tree. ... Get the trees to match 100%.").
#
# WHY: ir_dump_tree (src/ir/ast_print.c) prints a node's kind as tt_e_name[e->t], and the table is kept by hand with designated
# initializers, so a kind left out is a NULL that fputs dereferences. MEASURED 2026-09-29: TT_REPALT (Icon's repeated
# alternation |e) had no entry and out/parser_icon segfaulted in print_head on 45 of the 1715 Icon corpus programs, which the
# tree-for-tree gate counted as C refusals -- 45 files that could never MATCH, and nothing said why. The .sc parsers spell the
# same names (parser_icon.sc reduces 'TT_REPALT'), so a name must also be the enumerator's own spelling.
#
# THE ARMS: (1) every enumerator of `typedef enum tree_e { ... } tree_e;` but TT_KIND_COUNT has an entry `[TT_X] = "TT_X"`;
# (2) no entry names a kind the enum lacks; (3) THE PLANT: the same check over a copy of the header with its first table entry
# deleted must report that kind missing -- a check that cannot see a deleted entry refuses rc=2 instead of passing.
# rc 0 every kind named; rc 1 a kind unnamed or misspelled; rc 2 could not measure (header shape unreadable, plant not seen).
# Hermetic, no build, well under a second: a preflight arm.
