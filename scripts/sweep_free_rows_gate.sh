# sweep_free_rows_gate.sh -- THE CADENCE GATE for queue row `sweep-free-rows-are-real`.
# ⭐ WHY THIS EXISTS: that row is rank 0 and its DONE-WHEN refuses by design, so it is ALWAYS the
# topmost free row -- `s4e_msg.sh next` re-serves it to a fresh seat within seconds of the previous
# pass releasing it. Four separate picks (16:00Z, 18:54Z, 21:07Z, 21:08Z on 2026-08-24) opened a
# session, measured a 1-2 row delta, and released unworked. Passes 4-12 each flagged the underlying
# question -- event-driven vs clock-driven cadence -- and each declined it as "not this row's call".
# This script IS the call: it converts the clock-driven sweep into an event-driven one by measuring
# the delta BEFORE a pass is opened, so the decision is a computed exit status and not a judgement
# every seat has to re-derive from the LEDGER.
#
# ⛔ THE MISSING-INPUT ARM REFUSES (rc=2) AND NEVER SKIPS. This row's own sibling defect
# (`prolog-assertz-retract-abolish-unmasked`) exists because a `[ -d ] || exit 0` guard turned
# "I cannot measure" into "nothing to report" and hid 12 real failures for weeks. A gate that
# cannot read its inputs must be LOUD, never green.
#
# EXIT: 0 = gross churn >= threshold, a pass is worth running (proceed, work the row's ## NEXT)
#       1 = below threshold, RELEASE UNWORKED (record the delta in the LEDGER, do not open a pass)
#       2 = REFUSED, could not measure (missing QUEUE.tsv / claims/ / baseline) -- fix that first
