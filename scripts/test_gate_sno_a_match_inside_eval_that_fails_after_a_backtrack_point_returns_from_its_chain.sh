# THE DEFECT (the cto 2026-10-02, ceo CEO-1419 ticket snobol4-a-match-inside-eval-that-fails-after-a-backtrack-point-or-meets-
# abort-crashes-scrip, found by Lon's infinite_snobol4 demo): EVAL of a pattern match whose last-emitted box keeps state on the
# spine (ARB, BAL, REM, TAB, RTAB, SPAN, BREAK, BREAKX, FENCE of ARB, ABORT) died of SIGSEGV, a general-protection fault on the
# chain's own ret, both modes: 'z' ? ARB FAIL, 'a' ? ABORT. sbl fails or matches.
# THE CAUSE: the chain's outer exits (bb_glue_outer_gamma / _omega) released bb_glue_framed_leave's op_fc_bytes, the per-node
# emission register, read after the node loop had finished -- so the exit popped the LAST EMITTED BOX's state size (ARB: 16)
# on top of the chain's own carve and returned through a word above the return address. An EVAL chain never carves the outer
# glue frame at all (only a legacy main graph enters it).
# THE CURE: the outer exits release exactly what the glue entry carved -- nothing when it was not entered, its carve when it
# was (emit.cpp _glue_carve) -- and the SCRIP_GLUE_SYM killswitch whose default arm was the defect is gone.
#
# Each arm grades the evaluator's line for one text, both modes, against sbl -bf cut AT RUN TIME. rc=0 clean · rc=1 a
# divergence · rc=2 REFUSAL.
