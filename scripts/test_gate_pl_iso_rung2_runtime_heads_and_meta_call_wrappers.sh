# test_gate_pl_iso_rung2_runtime_heads_and_meta_call_wrappers.sh -- PROLOG ISO LADDER, RUNG 2 (cto, CEO-617, 2026-09-12).
# THE RUNG: a database builtin whose head, clause or predicate indicator is only known at RUN TIME -- asserta(_),
# four(F), asserta(F), retract((H :- B)) with H bound by a helper, clause(_, B), abolish(foo/X), retractall(T) --
# raises the ISO error term ($db_t_guard: instantiation_error, type_error(callable), permission_error on a control
# construct, a builtin or a static procedure, type_error(predicate_indicator) and abolish's atom/integer/
# not_less_than_zero/max_arity) or else acts on the predicate's store found BY KEY at run time (a registry in
# dynamic cell 0, bound to every compile-time cell by $db_bind at program start, growing an off-root store for a
# predicate the compiler never saw); a predicate first created at run time is reachable by name afterwards
# (rt_proc_register before the flags); an abolished predicate answers existence_error; the file clauses of a
# dynamic predicate are seeded once from the $db_seed/0 graph before any directive runs; the meta-call wrappers
# cover assert/asserta/assertz/retract/retractall/abolish/clause so call(assertz(foo(1))) works; a predicate
# unknown at compile time is a run-time meta-call instead of a compile-time existence_error, which also cures
# the $fc/3 helper's self-recursion (it was compiled to existence_error, so a meta-called ','/2 whose left
# conjunct was itself a conjunction raised existence_error('$fc'/3)).
# WITNESS: the Logtalk ISO groups this rung moves, graded one --group at a time in BOTH modes against the floors
# measured at landing. RED BEFORE (after rung 1, m3): asserta_1 16/24, assertz_1 16/24, abolish_1 12/16,
# retract_1 13/18, retractall_1 10/15, clause_2 11/16, cut_0 16/21. A later rung may only raise a floor.
