# test_bench_pascal_timed.sh -- ANGLE 1 of the Pascal three-angle triangulation (row bench-rivals-raku-pascal,
# mirroring test_bench_prolog_timed.sh / ARCH-BENCH-CAMPAIGN-README-TABLES.md THREE-ANGLE TRIANGULATION).
#
# Fixed WALL-TIME budget, iterations counted: a live doubling search over the kernel's OWN `reps` value
# (fed via stdin -- every kernel here opens with `readln(reps); for rep := 1 to reps do <body>`, so this
# needs no source rewriting the way the Prolog triangulator's mkwrap does) picks the largest reps whose
# single bench_rusage-wrapped run completes within TIME_BUDGET_MS, then reports rate = reps / cpu_seconds.
# ⛔ SCOPED TO THE 7 REPS-CAPABLE KERNELS ONLY (bubble/intmm/perm/queens/quick/sieve/towers). `uplevel2`/
# `uplevel3` have no `reps` knob -- fixed 30000x8000 workload baked into the source -- and need a
# PROCESS-LEVEL repeat mechanism this script does not implement; see corpus/benchmarks/pascal/EXCLUDED.tsv.
# `fbench` SIGSEGVs at compile time (row pascal-fbench-nested-function-self-assign-null-name) and `whet`
# has no committed `.ref` -- both excluded, not silently dropped.
#
# ⛔ CORRECTNESS GATES THE TIMING: every kernel's reps=1 output is verified against its `.ref` before ever
# being timed -- a kernel that fails this is SKIPped, never silently timed anyway. Per the row's own
# measured invariant (hq_C, 2026-08-27: "reps=1,2,3 -> 10414 every time" on the pre-fix `quick`), the
# PRINTED output does not vary with reps -- these kernels loop internally for cost, not for a changing
# answer -- so reps=1's output is the correctness oracle at every reps value, not just reps=1.
#
# ⛔⭐ THE exit= FIELD IS THE ONLY TRUSTED CRASH SIGNAL (same lesson as the Prolog triangulator, row
# bench-rivals-prolog, seat14 FINDING) -- a segfaulting child still writes a well-formed BENCH_RUSAGE
# line; only bench_rusage's own exit= field is trusted, never stderr text-sniffing.
#
# ⭐ SLOPE CURE (row readme-perf-grids-three-angles-all-seven, hq_P FINDING-2026-09-04-hq_P-pascal-angle-
# bias-is-a-per-run-fixed-cost-inside-the-program-not-process-startup.md): these kernels carry a large
# PER-RUN FIXED COST INSIDE THE PROGRAM (bubble m4 235.8ms, 107x process startup) that `rate = reps/cpu`
# leaves in the denominator, so the measured rate climbs with reps instead of being a constant of the
# kernel -- and the two angles amortize it over DIFFERENT reps, producing a one-sided bias. The cure,
# mirroring bench_ir_slope.sh's Ir(n)=OVERHEAD+n*WORK regression: reuse the existing doubling search to
# find the anchor reps value (unchanged budget/cap logic, call it n3), then also measure at n1=n3/4 and
# n2=n3/2 and report WORK = the SLOPE (us per rep, a COST -- lower is faster) fitted from (n2,n3) with
# (n1,n2)'s slope as the independent cross-check; the two must agree within LIN_TOL or the cell reads
# NONLINEAR rather than publishing a number. ⛔ WORK is COST-basis like bench_ir_slope.sh's WORK column,
# the OPPOSITE convention from the old rate (reps/s, bigger=faster) this replaces -- perf_mult callers
# downstream must pass (rival, ours), never (ours, rival), or the published multiple silently inverts.

# ⛔ TIMEOUT WAS 30, RAISED TO 60 (matching angle 2's own default): measured live this session, one of
# five run1_min trials at bubble/m4 n3=64 hit the 30s wall (exit=124, a real `timeout` kill, not a crash)
# under this box's load (~10/16 cores) -- hq_P's own reference FINDING for this same kernel measured at
# load ~3-5, half of what this session saw, so a tighter timeout that worked for them is tighter than
# this session's actual contention warrants.
# ⛔ BUDGET_MS WAS 800, LOWERED TO 150 -- MEASURED LIVE, NOT A GUESS: with x1/x4/x16 spacing anchored on
# an 800ms budget, the TOP point (16x the anchor) runs ~16x800ms=12.8s regardless of kernel -- confirmed
# directly on fpc/bubble (n=65536, three back-to-back trials: 16.90/17.04/17.75s, TIGHTLY clustered, so
# NOT scheduling jitter) with a slope that climbs 35% between the (n1,n2) and (n2,n3) segments even
# though bubble.pas resets its seed and regenerates its array every single rep (verified in source --
# every rep is provably identical work, so a real per-rep cost cannot be nonlinear). The reproducible,
# non-random shape of the disagreement points at something correlated with a measurement's OWN wall-clock
# duration under this box's sustained ~10/16-core fleet load (CPU frequency scaling under sustained load
# is the leading candidate) -- not noise averaging fixes, since it is not per-trial-random, and not wider
# spacing, since that makes it WORSE (a longer top point spends more time in a different regime than the
# short bottom point). The fix is to keep ALL THREE points short and close in duration: at BUDGET_MS=150,
# the same x1/x4/x16 triple's top point runs ~150ms*16=2.4s, calculated and then confirmed short enough
# to avoid the effect on this box. Every engine's anchor shrinks proportionally, not just the slow ones.
