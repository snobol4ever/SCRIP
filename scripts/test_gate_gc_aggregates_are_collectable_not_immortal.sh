# test_gate_gc_aggregates_are_collectable_not_immortal.sh -- a dead list, table, set or record is RECLAIMED: the collector marks the four HB_WS/HB_WSS/HB_DINST/HB_ARR types from their roots like every other block instead of force-marking them live at every regeneration (ceo CEO-661, GC-5 rung 1, on Lon's "we do not allow pinning in our heap since we slide").
#
# MEASURED 2026-09-13 on 71b32337f: `every i := 1 to 4000000 do L := [i, i+1, i+2]` -- a program holding ONE list --
# died with SIGABRT at 997 MB, because gc_heap.c force-marked every block of those four types live at every collection
# (hb_pinned, the mark loop) since ac044419d. Cure: the force-mark is gone by default; the four types are reached
# through the roots. That exposed a real hole the exemption had been hiding: the name/value table's own entries are
# rt_pinned_alloc'd HB_WS blocks and core_gc_roots walked the buckets WITHOUT marking the entries, their names or their
# chain -- so with the exemption gone the table was collected out from under itself and the next collection read a
# freed entry's `cell` as a pointer (SIGSEGV in rt_gc_visit_descr). core_gc_roots now marks the table it walks, the
# way the Pascal heap table became a movable root.
# ARMS: (1) the 4M-list churn COMPLETES with the right answer and stays under 800 MB; (2) the control arm
# (Historic, pre-CEO-799:) SCRIP_GC_PIN_AGGREGATES=1 restored the old policy and still died; that knob was deleted with the pinning mechanism on 2026-09-16 and the control arm is now the spelling census.
# nothing; (3) correctness under heavy collection: 200000 lists into a table, byte-identical to icont.
# FAIL_ONCE has no control knob to route through any more (CEO-799); the census arm is the control.
#
# ⛔ ARM 1's 800 MB MEMORY BOUND IS REPORTED, NOT BLOCKING, BY THE ceo's RULING CEO-821 (2026-09-17) ON THE cfo's
# MEASUREMENT. ARM 1's CORRECTNESS HALF (completes, rc=0, answer "done 3") AND ARMS 2 AND 3 ALL STAY BLOCKING: the
# split is here in the gate rather than a leading dash in the Makefile precisely so everything except the RSS figure
# keeps its teeth. WHY: F6 step 1 (the allocator never collects; the arena is a capped virtual reserve) took this
# witness from FIVE collections at 157144 KB RSS to ONE collection at 861932 KB, answer correct and rc=0 on both
# sides -- a memory reading, not a corruption. The cause is not the growth policy (a 2 MB growth step versus a full
# window moved RSS by 84 KB): AN ICON ALLOCATION LOOP CONTAINS NO SAFE POINT AT ALL. The shielded rt_gc_point_arr
# sites the frozen design keeps are SNOBOL4 and Prolog by-name dispatch points; an every-do loop reaches none, so the
# pending flag is set inside the first 128 MB and nothing takes it until the program ends.
# ⭐ THE LIFT IS NAMED: the cto's Icon allocating-box polls, F6 step 4 of
# .github/ARCH-GC-COMPILE-TIME-FRAME-MAPS.md section 7, PULLED AHEAD by CEO-821 for exactly this reading. WHEN THEY
# LAND, DELETE THIS PARAGRAPH AND LET THE 800 MB BOUND BLOCK AGAIN. Until then arm 1 prints its RSS every run: a
# reported arm that stops printing its number is worse than no arm at all.
