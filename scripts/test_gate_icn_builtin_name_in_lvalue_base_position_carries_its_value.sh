#
# WHAT IT PINS. A bare builtin/procedure NAME used as the BASE of an lvalue-capable operation -- x[i], x[i:j],
# x[i]:=v, ?x, !x -- must carry its procedure value in &errorvalue when that operation raises, exactly as the
# Arizona oracle does. SCRIP lowers a bare name in base position to IR_VAR_REF (for assignability: x[1]:=5
# needs it) while every OTHER operand position goes through lower() and resolves the name to its value; the
# IR_VAR->IR_PROC_VALUE post-pass in lower_icon_resolve_call_kinds() (src/lower/lower_icon.c) therefore never
# saw the base, and &errorvalue read &null. That pass now visits IR_VAR_REF under its own unchanged guard.
#
# ⭐ WHY THE GUARD LIVES IN A POST-PASS AND NOT AT THE LOWERING SITE, which is the reusable part. The test is
# "this name is a builtin/procedure AND is not an assignable variable HERE", and the second half is a
# WHOLE-GRAPH question -- is this name ever the target of an assignment in this procedure -- which cannot be
# answered while the graph is still being built. The post-pass already answered it for value position. Widening
# its node filter by one op was the whole cure; a new guard at the lowering site would have had to re-derive it
# and could not have.
# ⛔ A patch at the runtime raise site CANNOT work and this is measured, not argued: c_rt_subscript_var is
# handed a cell-form varref (DT_N slen=1, ptr=<stack cell>) with NO NAME present, so no runtime-side lookup
# can recover `pull`. A name-form patch there compiles, reads correctly and changes nothing.
#
# ⛔ THIS GATE ASSERTS THE ORACLE'S OWN VALUES, NOT THE ABSENCE OF THE OLD BAD ONE. Grepping for "&null" would
# go green the moment the wrong value acquired a different spelling. Every want below is cut from a FRESHLY
# BUILT icont/iconx binary -- ⛔ never from a stale ./probe left in the scratch dir by an earlier compile, which
# is how a failed icont run reads as a passing oracle.
# ⛔⭐⭐ `SECTION` (`pull[1:2]`) IS BLOCKING, AND THE STORY OF HOW IT NEARLY WAS NOT IS THE SECOND LESSON HERE.
# It is a TWO-SEAT COMPOSITION: 4c1ed8593 (another seat, same sitting) made a section of the null value RAISE
# 110 instead of quietly slicing nothing, and this commit made the base carry its VALUE. Neither cure alone
# greens this arm; together the shape matches the oracle exactly, in both modes.
# ⛔ I WROTE THIS ARM AS INFORMATIONAL-AND-NOT-OURS FIRST, and it was already cured in the tree I was about to
# land on. That is CLAUDE.md's tolerated-red rule biting inside a single sitting: a carve-out is written when
# the defect is discovered and read long after it is closed, so it goes stale in the FLATTERING direction --
# it invites the next reader to tolerate a failure that is now a live regression. ⭐ THE CHEAP GUARD IS THE ONE
# THAT CAUGHT IT: run the DONE-WHEN after the rebase, not before, and read every arm of the output rather than
# the verdict line -- the ✅ on a row I had just documented as red is what exposed it. A carve-out needs a
# re-measurement on the merged tree before it ships, exactly like any other number.
# ⛔ IT IS ALSO WHERE THIS GATE ALMOST PINNED A FICTION: read inside a multi-error program the expression
# reported 114 in one probe and 116 in the next -- each time the number the PRECEDING record had raised. A
# number that moves when you reorder the probes around it is not that expression's number. Run the suspect
# FIRST, in a program of its own, where UNSET is reachable: before 4c1ed8593 SCRIP printed no line at all
# there, because the enclosing write() fails on an unset &errornumber. That is the honest signature of "no
# error was raised", and it is invisible anywhere a previous raise has left a plausible value behind.
# ⭐ ARM 2 IS THE CONTROL THAT MUST NOT MOVE: subscript ASSIGNMENT through a real variable -- declared local,
# global, and IMPLICITLY-declared local alike. Getting the guard wrong breaks exactly these, and they are the
# reason the prior seat stopped at the diagnosis rather than half-landing the cure.
