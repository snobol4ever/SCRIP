# test_gate_library_driver_generator.sh -- THE HERMETIC GATE FOR util_gen_library_driver.py (ceo CEO-706 ->
# hq_B, rank 0, 2026-09-13).  It proves the generator's four brief-named arms plus the two its own proving
# ground added, and EVERY ARM WAS MADE TO FAIL ONCE before it was made to pass.
#
# ⛔⭐ WHY A GATE AND NOT A TRANSCRIPT.  The tool's job is to mint ~900 refs across four lanes.  A generator
# that cuts refs without its refusals intact manufactures permanently-red tests at scale -- hq_S's witness is
# the AIS row, which could never have closed because ATN prints TIME deltas on 19 lines, so two oracle runs of
# it differ on 38.  The refusals ARE the deliverable; the skeleton is a convenience.  So they are asserted
# here, executably, on fixtures this gate mints, rather than described in a commit message.
#
# ⛔ HERMETIC: every fixture is minted under a mktemp root and dies with the trap.  It grades no corpus
# population, writes no SCORE row and publishes no board.  It needs a BUILD OF NOTHING -- no scrip binary, no
# make -- and so belongs in `make preflight`.
# ⛔ IT NEEDS THE ORACLE, AND A MISSING ORACLE REFUSES rc=2 RATHER THAN PASSING.  Five of these arms are about
# what the oracle answers; with no oracle they would all "pass" by never contradicting anything, which is the
# absent-oracle false-green this tree has paid for more than once.
#
# THE THREE EXIT CODES (lib_gate.sh's rule): 0 clean · 1 a violation · 2 could-not-measure.  Never skip-as-success.
set -u

# the alternative). The tool under test is the one beside this file, never $S4E/SCRIP/scripts/<name>.

# second. The self-diff is a sample of size two and a one-second clock is invisible to it. A third run, or a
# sleep, buys a wider sample of the SAME instrument; the cure is a SECOND INSTRUMENT WITH A DIFFERENT BLIND
# SPOT, so the source is read for known nondeterministic primitives. Agreement is only evidence when the
# arms CAN disagree.
# ⛔ THE WITNESS CALLS THE CLOCK AND DOES NOT PRINT IT, WHICH IS WHAT MAKES THIS ARM ISOLATE THE SOURCE SCAN.
# A witness that PRINTS a clock is caught by whichever arm runs first, and a DATE() printed twice is worse
# than useless here: measured, it straddles a second boundary often enough to be FLAKY in both directions --
# it agreed on '09/13/26 17:15:14' one minute and disagreed on 2 lines the next. This one prints a constant,
# so its two oracle runs AGREE every time (measured 4 of 4, on real non-empty output) and the ONLY thing that
# can object to it is the source scan. Delete that scan and this arm goes silent, which is what the fail-once
# proof requires.
# ⛔ IT IS ALSO A DELIBERATELY CONSERVATIVE REFUSAL, AND THAT IS THE RIGHT BIAS: the tool cannot prove the
# clock's value never reaches the output, so it refuses and says to author the driver by hand. For something
# minting ~900 refs, a false refusal costs a human a minute and a false mint costs a suite its meaning.
