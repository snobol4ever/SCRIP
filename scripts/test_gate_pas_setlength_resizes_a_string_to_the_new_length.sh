# test_gate_pas_setlength_resizes_a_string_to_the_new_length.sh -- SetLength(S, N) on a string or widestring variable
# resizes it to exactly N characters (truncating or extending), matching ISO 6.6.3.3's var-parameter semantics by
# REASSIGNING the variable to a freshly built string rather than mutating in place, since SCRIP strings are plain
# value-copied DESCR strings with no in-place resize.
#
# MEASURED 2026-10-01 by hq_pascal, row pascal-every-suite-to-100-under-nonet-ceo-1266. monitor_run.sh --oracle on
# corpus/packages/pascal/fpc_tests/webtbs_tw4763.pas bracketed the divergence at step 5 (stno 15, the SetLength call):
# fpx continues to stno 16, scr ENDs there (error 22: Undefined function called) -- SetLength was not implemented at
# all (zero occurrences anywhere in src/parsers/pascal/pascal.y or src/runtime before this landing).
#
# CURE: pascal.y's mk_call special-cases "setlength" exactly as it already does "inc"/"dec" -- a procedure that
# reassigns its first (variable) argument from a computed value -- lowering SetLength(v, n) to v := __pas_setlength(v, n).
# The new runtime builtin __pas_setlength (src/runtime/by_name_dispatch.c, beside __pas_alpha_str) allocates a fresh
# string of the requested length, copying min(old,new) bytes from the original. ⛔ MEASURED BUG CAUGHT BEFORE LANDING:
# the first cut padded a GROWN string's new bytes with NUL (0), which silently broke Length() on the grown string --
# every string-length function in this runtime (see "length" in the shared by-name dispatch) reads strlen(), so a NUL
# byte anywhere reads as the string's end. Padding with a space instead keeps Length() correct; the actual CONTENT of
# bytes past the old length is undefined by the ISO/FPC spec and MEASURED to differ from fpc -Miso's own choice (fpc's
# reference-counted strings expose old capacity bytes after a prior shrink; SCRIP's fresh allocation cannot and need
# not reproduce that) -- no arm below prints a grown string's content, only its length, to stay off that undefined
# ground entirely.
#
# ARMS, both modes, each program's expected stdout and exit code cut LIVE from fpc -Miso: (1) shrink -- SetLength
# truncates a string, prints the (well-defined) truncated content and its new length; FAILS on parent (error 22).
# (2) grow -- SetLength extends a string past its old length; prints ONLY the lengths before and after, never the
# grown content (undefined ground, deliberately not graded); FAILS on parent. (3) widewit -- the exact witness shape
# that found this defect: a WideString set via SetLength to its OWN current length (a no-op in substance), printing
# Length(); FAILS on parent, same error 22. FAIL_ONCE=1 corrupts arm 3's ref.
