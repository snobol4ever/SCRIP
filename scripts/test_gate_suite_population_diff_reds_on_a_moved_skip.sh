# test_gate_suite_population_diff_reds_on_a_moved_skip.sh -- A SKIP THAT MOVES IS A RED, IN EITHER DIRECTION
# (coo 2026-09-17, CEO-824; row instruments-a-skip-count-change-between-batches-is-a-red-not-a-silent-population-change,
# minted on the cfo's escalation).
#
# THE DEFECT, MEASURED, AND WHY A GATE RATHER THAN A HABIT.  The SNOBOL4 master read m4_pass=1970 m4_skip=0 at SCRIP
# ad0f85fae and m4_pass=1967 m4_skip=3 at b12714737, and that landing's own commit said "equal to base program for
# program" while its board wrote SCORE's SnoM row on that tree; the three were cured at 0567ad829 and read skip=0 at
# a861648ab.  BOTH the appearance and the disappearance passed unremarked, because every reader compared PASS and a
# SKIP fires no verdict in the ladder -- it is the DENOMINATOR moving, which lowers the pass count exactly like a
# regression and raises it exactly like a cure.
#
# WHAT THIS GRADES: the instrument, not a suite.  It is hermetic and needs no build -- it plants readings and asserts
# the verdicts, so it cannot go quiet when a runner is unavailable.
#   (a) util_suite_population_diff.py --selftest passes, and its arms are COUNTED (>= 13)
#   (b) THE RECORDED PAIR, re-derived here rather than trusted: 0 -> 3 is rc=1, 3 -> 0 is rc=1, identical is rc=0
#   (c) a pass/fail move with the population FIXED is rc=0 -- an instrument that reds on everything measures nothing
#   (d) two families and a shard-vs-full reading each REFUSE rc=2, never a number
# FAIL_ONCE=1 blanks the selftest's proof line before arm (a) asserts, to prove the arm trips.
