# test_gate_icn_pre_step_tool_matches_icont_e.sh -- SCRIP'S OWN ICON PRE-STEP, out/scrip-ipp (JCON's preprocessor in Icon, compiled by
# scrip), WRITES THE TEXT THE ORACLE'S icont -E WRITES, ON EVERY CORPUS .icn (Lon 2026-09-30: "So we want to provide for SCRIP the IPP,
# Icon Pre Processor, as a pre-step." · "Let's use JCON's full pre-processor written in Icon as our IPP if it looks good." · "Do not use
# the oracle's pre-process step if it is part of the product"; RULES.md FACT RULE SCRIP DOES NOT PREPROCESS; GOAL-CEO.md CEO-1366).
#
# THE CONTRACT: for every corpus program (tests, packages, benchmarks, demos; ALL.* containers excluded), run in its own directory with
# LPATH naming the IPL include directories: whenever icont -E exits 0 the pre-step exits 0 and its PROGRAM TEXT is identical -- the
# lines that are not line-sync (a "#line N" directive or an empty line) compared in order, because the two preprocessors spell the
# line sync differently (Arizona replaces a directive line by an empty line and writes #line after a skipped region; JCON fills a gap
# under 20 lines with empty lines and writes #line otherwise) and SCRIP's lexer maps both to the same source line (measured: an error
# on source line 4 is named line 4 through either); and whenever icont -E refuses, the pre-step refuses (Arizona's own preprocessor
# tests tpp*.icn carry deliberate $error, unterminated and missing-include arms; a Scrip polyglot demo carries $import, not Icon's).
# The oracle is the GATE here, never a step of the product. PROVEN FAIL-ONCE: IPP_BIN=/bin/true reads FAIL on every file. ~30 s.
# Exit 0 = every file agrees; 1 = a disagreement, named; 2 = cannot measure.
