"""util_gc_event_coverage.py -- SCRIP'S GC EVENT SPACE, AND WHICH EVENTS THE CORPUS ACTUALLY EXERCISES.

Row gc-event-coverage-is-the-criterion-not-collection-count (coo, 2026-09-21, MODE TENET, CEO-1029).

WHY THE AXIS CHANGED. A stress setting only tests the gc-points where a collection ACTUALLY OCCURS, and that
subset need not differ between executions -- so COLLECTION COUNT is the wrong axis. Measured on this tree:
bench_icnstr_concat_table.icn at SCRIP_HEAP_MB=1 gives 38781 collections at stress 1, 32015 at stress 5 and
10006 at stress 16, and hq_raku found 36 silently-wrong Raku programs at stress 16 that stress 1, 3 and 5 all
called GREEN. FEWER COLLECTIONS FOUND MORE DEFECTS. GCFuzz names the right axis: EVENT COVERAGE -- a coverage
criterion over GC EVENTS. A configuration that raises no new event coverage is not worth running; one that
raises it is worth keeping.

⛔ THE DENOMINATOR IS THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS INSTRUMENT, SO IT IS PRINTED THREE WAYS AND NEVER ONE.
This row exists because a green instrument was measuring the wrong axis. Ratcheting a SUBSET and letting it
read as "the event space" would be that same offence one level up, so the report carries, by name and never as
a count alone (CEO-997 batch 30 clause 2):
  OBSERVABLE  -- the event has telemetry the collector already emits, so it can be exercised and counted here.
  OWED        -- the event is real and the collector does not distinguish it. NAMED, never silently dropped.
  ABSENT      -- the event does not exist in this collector at all. Carrying a bucket that can never fill
                 would read as permanent 0% coverage of a thing that cannot happen, so it is named ABSENT and
                 its absence is ASSERTED: the day a code path appears, this instrument REDS and demands the
                 event be reclassified rather than quietly keeping a stale map.

⛔ THIS INSTRUMENT EDITS NO src/. Under CEO-723 this seat holds no cure lane; every OBSERVABLE event below is
read from telemetry that is already in the tree, and every OWED event is a one-line ask to the seat that owns
the collector, not a change made here.

# ⛔⭐ LAYOUT SENSITIVITY, MEASURED HERE, AND IT IS WHY THE PROBE SET IS PINNED RATHER THAN CONVENIENT.
# A COVERAGE READING IS A PROPERTY OF (program, stress, INVOCATION) AND NOT OF THE PROGRAM ALONE. Measured on
# hb_nv.sno at SCRIP_HEAP_MB=1 SCRIP_GC_STRESS=1, one binary, one tree, the ONLY difference the spelling of the
# path handed to ./scrip:
#     scripts/gc_witnesses/hb_nv.sno            -> interior=1   (the event IS reached)
#     ./scripts/gc_witnesses/hb_nv.sno          -> interior=0   (two characters longer; the event is NOT reached)
#     /home/claude_coo/SCRIP/scripts/.../hb_nv.sno -> interior=0
# Three runs each, no variation within a spelling. The source path is itself a heap block, so its length shifts
# every block after it, and whether any reference lands INTERIOR to a block is decided by that incidental shift.
# ⛔ THE CONSEQUENCE FOR THIS INSTRUMENT: an event reached by ONE witness at ONE marginal count is not a fact
# about the corpus, it is a fact about how that run was spelled -- and a ratchet resting on it would red or green
# depending on whether a caller wrote `scripts/x` or `./scripts/x`. So every probe here is chosen for being
# ROBUST: each was re-run under all three spellings above and reached its event at the same count every time.
# ⭐ AND THE SAME MEASUREMENT IS A FINDING FOR THE FLEET, not just a caveat for this file: two seats running the
# same witness at the same stress from roots of different name length ARE EXERCISING DIFFERENT GC EVENTS, and
# nothing in any board line says so. That is the row's own thesis one level down -- the configuration has to be
# named, or the number is about something nobody wrote down.
