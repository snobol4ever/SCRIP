# error-voice-statement-number-from-a-code-map-no-per-statement-store (ceo CEO-1385, minted 2026-09-30, handed to
# hq_snobol4 2026-10-01 09:2x). Since 18f22388e (diagnostics off by default, CEO-1243) a SNOBOL4/Snocone fatal error
# prints no "; statement N" where sbl -bf's post-mortem always does. THE CURE (not yet landed): the emitter writes a
# code-to-statement map beside the emitted code in both media and core_error_voice recovers stno from the faulting
# return address through it -- never a per-statement store on the execution path (TRACE's existing --stlimit-gated
# store, bb_stmt_mark/rt_stmt_enter, is UNCHANGED and stays off by default; --stlimit/TRACE are CEO-1243's business,
# not this row's).
# FOUR WITNESSES, INLINE (re-measured here against sbl -bf at run time, never a frozen number): until 2026-10-02 they
# were packages/snobol4/spitbol_testpgms test4/test5/test7/test8 themselves (the coo, 2026-09-30 19:22), which ended in a
# SPITBOL post-mortem because each opened with a Macro SPITBOL 360/370 statement SPITBOL x64 refuses. Lon modernized
# those four on 2026-10-02 (ceo CEO-1401: "fix the I/O associations to be modern", "Change the CHAR to CHR") and they
# now run to completion, so the gate carries the four refused statements itself, each a few statements deep -- two
# INPUT(.INPUT,,72) (ERROR 116), the DATA field CHAR (ERROR 248), an OUTPUT with a FORTRAN format (ERROR 160) -- the
# same error classes the vendored programs raised, and a gate anchored on a found witness dies when the witness is
# cured (ceo CEO-554). "in line"/"in statement" are read from the oracle's own post-mortem through
# util_spitbol_post_mortem.py, never hardcoded.
# TWO ARITHMETIC WITNESSES (ceo CEO-1572, the coo's audit 2026-10-08: the nine arms above were all BUILTIN faults and the GOAL was red on an
# arithmetic one): arith1  X = N + "q"  at top level (sbl: statement 1) and arith2  the same statement inside a DEFINEd function G (sbl: statement
# 2). The arithmetic boxes call an asm leaf (rt_add_sno ...) that sets up no rbp frame, so the frame-pointer walk skipped the return address
# into the statement and the voice read statement 0; the cure walks the stack by its unwind CFI (_Unwind_Backtrace) and takes the innermost
# frame whose pc the code map knows.
# ARM shape per witness per mode: run SCRIP with NO --stlimit, render its stderr through util_render_error_voice.py
# spitbol (the one renderer, RULES.md SS ONE ERROR VOICE) and read "in statement <n>" from the rendered text -- the
# renderer prints stno 0 when SCRIP's voice carried none, so arm `loc` is RED on today's tree by construction.
# ARM `nostore`: a trivial 3-statement program's default --compile .s carries zero occurrences of g_stno -- a
# regression guard that the cure adds a compile-time side table, never a runtime store (grep the .s, zero hits);
# true today already (IR_STMT_MARK is not emitted without --stlimit) and must stay true after the cure.
# EXIT: 0 every arm passes (the row may close) . 1 an arm is red (today: every `loc` arm) . 2 REFUSED (no oracle,
# stale binary, no scrip, the premise moved -- re-measure before trusting this gate).
