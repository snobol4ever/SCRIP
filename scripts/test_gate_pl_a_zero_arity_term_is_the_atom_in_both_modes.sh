# test_gate_pl_a_zero_arity_term_is_the_atom_in_both_modes.sh -- `foo()` read from source and by read_term_from_atom/3 is the ATOM
# foo in both modes: atom/1 holds, functor/3 gives foo/0, arg/3 on it raises type_error(compound, foo), and no zero-arity compound
# cell (a DT_PLREF whose functor has arity 0) ever exists. Pinned at R1.3 (SCRIP cf3ed3dd5) because that landing dropped the
# arity-nonzero test from bb_call_pl_leaf.cpp's PLR_COMP guard (a compound's slen is a functor id now, not arity-packed), keeping
# the tag test alone; the cto asked for the zero-arity shape to be a witness in both modes, not prose (2026-09-27).
#
# THE STANDARD AND THE ORACLES, NAMED. ISO 13211-1 has no `foo()` (it is a syntax error); SWI-Prolog 7+ reads it as a compound with
# zero arguments and its functor/3 raises domain_error(compound_non_zero_arity, foo()) -- ORACLE-DIVERGENT by the cto's ruling (an
# SWI-7 extension outside the ISO superset SCRIP carries); GNU Prolog refuses `foo()` as a syntax error. SCRIP's choice, measured
# on the tree before R1.3 and after it: the reader yields the atom. This gate pins that choice and that the two modes agree; the
# expected text is written here, not cut from an oracle, because no oracle carries this superset choice.
