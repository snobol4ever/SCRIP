# test_gate_ref_cutters_refuse_a_dead_oracle.sh -- THE ACCEPTANCE GATE for row every-ref-cutting-path-refuses-
# when-the-oracle-dies-mid-cut (ceo -> hq_T 2026-09-04, instrument side of seat07's rung04 FINDING; the ORACLE
# cure is hq_P's row snobol4-oracle-sbl-bf-sigsegv-on-error-212-recovery-cuts-refs-silently).
#
# THE DEFECT CLASS: `sbl -bf` SIGSEGVs on about half its ERROR 212 runs WHILE PRINTING the diagnostic. A cutter
# that asks only "did the oracle produce bytes?" then writes a TRUNCATED ref -- and a truncated ref is the worst
# artifact this project can produce, because it is a plausible-looking pin that grades every future run against
# a lie, and nothing downstream can tell it from a good one.
#
# ⛔⭐ FOUR OF FIVE CUTTERS ALREADY REFUSED WHEN THIS ROW WAS MINTED. That is why this file is a GATE and not a
# sweep of cures: the value here is the CENSUS WITH A PRINTED DENOMINATOR (ARM 6), so a NEW cutter -- the sixth,
# written a month from now by someone who never read seat07's finding -- reds HERE, rather than by pinning a
# truncated ref that nobody notices for weeks. A cure protects the paths that exist; a census protects the ones
# that do not exist yet.
#
# ⛔⛔ THE PROBE PRINTS OUTPUT AND *THEN* SEGFAULTS, and that is the whole difficulty. An oracle that dies
# silently is caught by any "did it produce anything?" check, so a gate built on one would pass on a cutter that
# has no status check at all. The synthetic oracle below emits two good lines AND the ERROR 212 footer before
# killing itself with SIGSEGV -- the exact shape of the real failure, in which every byte written so far looks
# like a correct answer.
#
# ⭐ ARM 7 IS THE CONTROL, AND IT IS NOT OPTIONAL: with a WELL-BEHAVED synthetic oracle the same paths must
# actually mint. Without it, a cutter that refused everything unconditionally -- or a probe harness that never
# reached the cutter at all -- would pass every other arm here (RULES.md THE INSTRUMENT LAWS: agreement counts
# only when the arms can disagree).
#
# ARMS: 1 the probe itself behaves as designed · 2 the harness's shared oracle reader classifies it CRASH, which
# is the mechanism cmd_capture_oracle_refs's `kind != RAN` guard rests on · 3 the package builder excludes it
# naming the signal · 4 scorecard's cmd_oracle (util_ref_mint's one door to the oracle) classifies SIG11 and so
# never reaches its LIVE mint path · 5 util_mint_bench_refs names the signal and mints nothing · 6 the CENSUS,
# printed denominator · 7 the control: a healthy oracle still mints.
# EXIT: 0 all arms · 1 an arm failed · 2 REFUSED (could not measure: no python3, missing cutter, mktemp failed).
