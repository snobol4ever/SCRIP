# test_gate_gc_runtime_compiled_code_bakes_no_arena_address.sh -- CODE COMPILED AT RUN TIME OUTLIVES EVERY COLLECTION, SO
# NOTHING IT BAKES AS AN IMMEDIATE MAY LIVE IN THE COLLECTED HEAP (cto 2026-09-23, CTO-152; law RULES.md FACT RULE THE
# COLLECTOR GUESSES NOTHING, CEO-812: a word the collector never visits is not a root, and an imm64 inside emitted code is
# exactly such a word).
#
# MEASURED 2026-09-23 on arbno_fence_span_branch_1 (the SNOBOL4 master, extracted standalone): with the deferred-pattern
# entry polled after dtp_fn_of (bb_match_defer.cpp:115, the last unpolled site of the census) the witness printed FAIL for
# MATCH at SCRIP_GC_STRESS=1/3/5 in every arena and relocation configuration, and gdb disassembly of the function dtp_fn_of
# returned (a runtime-compiled "rtpat" chain in the box pool) showed ONE imm64 inside [g_hp_arena, g_hp_top): an HB_WSC
# block holding "ARB$1", the ARBNO iteration variable's name that dtp_rcp_tree minted with rt_heap_strdup_c and the
# lowerer baked into the compiled code as the operand of a by-name load.  Referenced from nowhere the collector visits,
# the block was reclaimed at the first collection after the compile, and the name read as vacated ground.  Without the poll
# the compiled pattern ran to completion before any collection, which is why the census's last site stayed unpolled.
#
# THE CURE: every sval dtp_rcp_tree hands the runtime compiler (literal copies, the ARB$n and OPQ$n names, the deferred
# variable names) comes from ct_strdup/ct_strndup -- the compile-time arena that owns the parser's own literals for the
# life of the process -- never from rt_str_alloc or rt_heap_strdup_c.  THE INSTRUMENT: bb_compile_pat_tree_sz scans the
# bytes it just emitted for any 8-byte value inside the arena and prints [RTPAT-HEAPIMM] fn= bytes= heapimm= under
# SCRIP_RTPAT_DIAG=1; SCRIP_RTPAT_PLANT_HEAPIMM=1 restores the heap name so the scan can be seen to fire.
#
# ARMS: (a) every compile of the witness reads heapimm=0 (mode 3, where the scan lives); (b) the plant reads heapimm>=1 --
# an instrument never seen to fire is not known to look; (c) THE PROPERTY: the witness answers its oracle-cut ref at
# SCRIP_GC_STRESS=1,3,5 under SCRIP_GC_RELOC=1 at the compiled default arena in mode 3 and mode 4, with the entry polled.
# FAIL_ONCE=1 runs arm (a) under the plant and requires it to red.
