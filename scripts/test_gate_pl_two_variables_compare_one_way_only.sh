# test_gate_pl_two_variables_compare_one_way_only.sh -- THE STANDARD ORDER OF TWO DISTINCT VARIABLES IS ONE-WAY (ISO 7.2.1: Var @< Var is an
# implementation-dependent TOTAL order; hq_prolog 2026-09-25, CEO-1266; the cure is unification.c at 92e8f4db7).
# THE DEFECT. The comparison numbered variables by where a walk of the FIRST argument and then the second met them, so f(_) @< f(_) held in BOTH
# directions, compare/3 answered < both ways round, and bagof/setof, which order free-variable groups by pairwise comparison, could return them in
# an order no sort gives. The cure compares two unbound cells by address.
# ⛔ WHAT THIS GATE DOES NOT CLAIM: that a variable's place in the order survives var-var unification. It does not today -- the binding moves the
# variable's representative to a newer cell (plw_unify_cells), so msort([K2,K1]) and msort([K1,K2]) disagree once K1 and K2 were unified into a
# structure. That is its own row (prolog-a-var-var-binding-moves-the-older-variable-so-the-standard-order-of-variables-flips-across-calls).
# THE EXPECTATIONS ARE THE ORACLE'S: gprolog prints the five lines below (2026-09-25); the order it picks is its own, only the one-way-ness is graded.
# RED BEFORE on a clean origin build 62a21f70f: lines 1-3 read both(lt) both(lt) < < in m3 AND m4.
