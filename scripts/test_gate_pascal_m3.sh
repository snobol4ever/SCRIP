# ⭐ REPOINTED (seat04, 2026-08-30, row pascal-master-flatten-and-scrip-test-pas): the old dual mechanism
# (a loose-*.pas loop + a hand-maintained SUITE_FAMILIES list over crosscheck/) is retired now that
# util_build_master_suite.py --lang pascal absorbs both shapes into ONE flat ALL.pas/ALL.ref, matching
# test_corpus_snobol4.sh's own cutover. `pcom`/`pint` are gone (confirmed absent, the old skip is dropped).
# ⛔ REVERTED BACK TO THE FLAT PATH (seat04, 2026-08-30) after seat11 (`94c98593`, row pascal-restore-prezeta,
# genuinely well-intentioned) repointed this at `$CORPUS/master/ALL.pas`, believing the flat path "has never
# existed" -- it existed on origin/main a full 30 minutes before that commit (corpus `066a680bb`, 20:16:32,
# vs. `94c98593` at 20:43:53); seat11's own `master/` subdir had already been deleted in that same commit as
# superseded, so their fix pointed the gate at a path that was freshly GONE, not one that had never arrived.
# Read as a stale/unpulled local corpus checkout at the time they investigated, not a real conflict.
# ⭐ WHAT SEAT11 FOUND THAT STAYS FIXED, independent of the path mixup: this gate's own all-arms-zero refusal
# (below) could not have caught the master silently grading 0 entries, because the STDIN_FAMILIES loop (and
# on m3 the benchmark-witness section) always examines >0 -- exactly the kind of "measured fine" vs. "could
# not measure" collision RULES.md's own gate-witness law exists to forbid. MASTER_EXAMINED now refuses
# independently, not just as part of the combined check.
# ⛔ FIVE entries stay loose PERMANENTLY, not a residue of this repoint: read1-4 and pb35 read real stdin,
# and the suite format has no stdin-input concept (hq_C's SNOBOL4-side ruling, 2026-08-24 — see KEEP.md
# section 1). The master builder independently reaches the same conclusion (ALL.excluded.txt names all 5).
# Register a new permanent stdin exception in BOTH this file and test_gate_pascal_m4.sh's identical list.

# --- INTERIM WITNESS-PAIR CHECK over corpus/benchmarks/pascal (hq_C 2026-08-27, ceo-endorsed) -------------------
# WHY: benchmarks/pascal carries 9 .pas/.ref witness pairs that NO gate reached, so `pascal-uplevel-nested-proc-hang`
# could close DONE+landed and silently un-land with nothing able to say NO. Interim: retires when
# `pascal-refs-regen-from-fpc-oracle` (rank 0) puts this directory on the graded board.
# ⛔ Discovered BY A FILE IT MUST CONTAIN, never `-d` on the container -- the s274 lesson: the container survives a
# re-grid while the contents re-nest, so a `-d` guard passes over an empty/moved corpus and reads as a clean pass.
# ⛔ m3 ONLY, deliberately: 5 of these 9 SIGSEGV in m4 under the already-tracked `pascal-m4-registered-dispatch-segv`
# / `pascal-m4-intermittent-segv-pb30-sieve` rows. Wiring m4 here would re-report those rows as this gate's failure.
# ⛔ 7 of the 9 open with `readln(reps)`; feeding /dev/null yields reps=0, an empty loop and a PLAUSIBLE all-zero
# board that is pure instrument error (measured, hq_C 2026-08-27). The `1` below is load-bearing -- do not remove it.
