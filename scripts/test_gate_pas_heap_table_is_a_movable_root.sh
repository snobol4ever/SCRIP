# test_gate_pas_heap_table_is_a_movable_root.sh -- Pascal new/dispose records are ORDINARY MOVABLE BLOCKS reached through the heap table, which the collector walks as a root
#
# RULED CEO-648 on the coo's finding of 2026-09-12 19:02 CDT and Lon's word ("We do not allow pinning in our heap since we
# slide"): since ac044419d four block types were marked live unconditionally and never moved, and Pascal new() records were
# among them -- Pascal pointer stability was a side effect of that exemption, not a design. Pascal pointers are integer
# handles into a heap table, so the table is the right place for the invariant: the table itself now lives OUTSIDE the
# collector arena (plain malloc, so it never competes for the 512 MB slab), every live cell is visited by pas_gc_roots,
# which the collector calls beside core_gc_roots and gen_gc_roots, every record payload and every set is allocated through
# rt_str_alloc as an ordinary movable block, and dispose returns the handle to a free list so the table is reused.
#
# THE WITNESS: a linked list of 300 records, each holding a second record through a mate pointer, is built and kept
# reachable ONLY through the heap table; 20000 further records are allocated and disposed to churn the heap; then the kept
# list is walked and every field re-read. Under a forced collection the payloads MOVE, so a single missed root or a missed
# slot fix-up shows up as a wrong field. Graded byte-identical to fpc -Miso in both modes, plain and under forced
# collection. The last arm is the one the row is actually about: the collector must RECLAIM Pascal record bytes. If the
# records were still pinned, every regeneration would report reclaimed 0 and the arm fails. FAIL_ONCE=1 corrupts the
# node count of the first mode's plain arm to prove the diff arm trips.
