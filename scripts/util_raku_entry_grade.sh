# ⭐ PER-ENTRY GRADER FOR NAMED raku MASTER ENTRIES -- the development aid, never a board (hq_T 2026-09-13,
# row raku-every-xfail-fixed-as-a-faulty-test-or-cured-as-a-defect). ONE RUNNER, ONE BOARD binds: every master
# and package board is the coo's. This is the other thing -- `corpus_suite_harness.py on one entry`, the grading
# the contract explicitly leaves to each seat -- lifted to a NAMED SET so a class row's DONE-WHEN is one line
# instead of a twenty-line shell loop copied once per row. It writes no SCORE.md cell and prints no board line.
# ⛔ IT REFUSES rc=2 RATHER THAN PRINTING THE SUCCESS SHAPE when it cannot measure: no entry named, an entry the
# master does not carry, or a build that is not there. A runner that graded zero witnesses and exited 0 is the
# `make test` false-green trap wearing a different hat (CLAUDE.md § Testing).
# ⛔ rc CONTRACT: the expected rc comes from ALL.wantrc when the entry is declared there and is 0 otherwise --
# a die test whose stdout matches is a PASS, and grading it on stdout alone would score four xfails XPASS that
# are not (measured on this row: simple_program_10, say_die_1, sub_say_12, sub_say_6).
# Usage: util_raku_entry_grade.sh <entry> [entry ...]        rc: 0 all green · 1 a red · 2 could not measure
