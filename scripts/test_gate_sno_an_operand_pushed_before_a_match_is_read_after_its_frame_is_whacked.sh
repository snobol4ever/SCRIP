# THE ROWS (ceo CEO-1466, one cure for both): snobol4-an-alternation-whose-right-operand-is-a-match-loses-its-left-operand-the-pbalt-
# marshal-reads-an-unwritten-stack-slot (the cfo's) and snobol4-an-argument-evaluated-before-a-match-in-a-later-argument-is-read-from-
# the-wrong-stack-slot (the cto's, BLOCKED on it). From the ceo's CEO-1461 seed-1205 GP fault, reduced by hq_icon (FINDING-2026-10-03-
# hq_icon-eval-chain-reads-an-unwritten-stack-slot-as-an-alternation-operand) and the cfo: P = 'k' | ('xyz' ? 'y') then 'zzk' ? P . V
# read V = '' where sbl -bf reads k, in both modes, compiled or EVAL'd; DUPL, REPLACE, LPAD and a three-arm alternation the same way;
# with pointer-shaped stale bytes it was the strlen fault under rcp_of.
# THE CAUSE (the cfo in the emission, the cto in emit.cpp): a call's operand pushed BEFORE a value-context match and read AFTER it was
# addressed 96 bytes too high ([rsp + 176] for a cell at [rsp + 80]): the zd read loop (emit.cpp, the g_zd_read loop) added 64 +
# emit_match_begin_frame_extra for every IR_MATCH_BEGIN between producer and consumer, but every IR_MATCH_END ends in release_pump's
# frame whack (mov rsp, rbp; pop rbp), so a match whose END also lies between them has no frame left on the stack.
# THE CURE (the cto's, b96c81f66, landed by the cfo under CEO-1466): walking back from the consumer, an IR_MATCH_END opens a closed
# region (counted) and nothing inside it, its IR_MATCH_BEGIN included, adds height -- that frame and every byte pushed inside it are
# gone. An operand read INSIDE an open match is unchanged. The cto's own gate, ..._reads_its_own_slot.sh, carries nine direct shapes
# and seven EVAL lines; this one adds the bounds that were never wrong and the crash witness on both EVAL roads.
#
# ARMS, both modes, every expectation cut from sbl -bf at run time: (1) the alternation row's two lines; (2) the cto row's six (an
# alternation, DUPL, REPLACE, a three-arm alternation, LPAD with a nested alternation, and concatenation, which was never wrong);
# (3) the bounds that were never wrong (a match on the left of the alternation, concatenation either side, arithmetic) stay right;
# (4) hq_icon's three-line crash witness through its copy of the infinite_snobol4 evaluator (md5 4ce880cc, embedded verbatim: the
# crash needs the stale bytes this exact driver leaves) on the C road (SCRIP_EVAL_OPEN=0), where mode 3 died SIGSEGV on the parent,
# and on the open road.
# FAIL-ONCE, MEASURED on the parent (SCRIP c0fbd4343 without the cure, rebuilt; the cfo's first, equivalent edit stashed): both rows' DONE-WHENs RED in m3 and m4 (V= ; alt
# right, dupl, replace, alt3 empty, lpad ****) and the crash witness SIGSEGV in mode 3 on the C road. rc=0 clean · rc=1 · rc=2 REFUSAL.

*  inf_eval.sno -- the evaluator of infinite_snobol4: one SNOBOL4 expression per line of standard input, EVALed, one
*  result line out, so SPITBOL and SCRIP running it on the same lines can be compared line for line. SETEXIT traps
*  every error, EVAL's compile errors included, and the loop keeps going (Lon 2026-10-02).
*  THE VARIABLES a..z BELONG TO THE TEST (Lon 2026-10-02, in-chat to the ceo: "So never use variable a..z since they are
*  used by the test for simplicity."): every name of this program is inf_-prefixed, because SNOBOL4 scope is dynamic and
*  an EVALed (k = 5) would otherwise stomp the evaluator's own counter. A batch's PRE-SET lines give a..z their values
*  and the batch code may stomp on them (Lon: "They can be stomped on. That is the fun of the batch."); state lives for
*  the whole batch, one process per batch. f, g and h are the test's three functions, one per return shape: f(x) is a
*  value (x + 1), g(x) a pattern built at run time (x | 'c'), h(x) a name (.t[x], by NRETURN, failing when t[x] is null).
