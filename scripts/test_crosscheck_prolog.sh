# test_crosscheck_prolog.sh — 2-mode oracle crosscheck for PROLOG (GOAL-LANG-PROLOG)
#
# Runs the prolog test corpus through m3 (--run) and m4 (--compile via run_prolog_via_x86_backend.sh),
# grading EACH MODE INDEPENDENTLY against its .expected/.ref oracle.
# Run on every major push. Mode-consistency check, not regression.
# If .ref present alongside test file: diffs vs oracle too.
# Exits 0 only if BOTH modes have FAIL=0 against the oracle.

    # ⛔⛔ REWRITTEN seat15 2026-09-01 -- THIS FUNCTION COULD NOT FAIL. Three independent green-manufacturing
    # defects, each verified on a pristine -O0 tree (SCRIP f85e1fdc) before the cure:
    #   (1) it captured `--run` into $ir and `--run` into $run_out -- THE SAME INVOCATION -- then branched on
    #       `[ "$run_out" != "$ir" ]`. That is X != X: unreachable for any deterministic program, so the FAIL
    #       arm was dead code and mode 4 was NEVER INVOKED AT ALL, despite the header's "3-mode crosscheck"
    #       and "Exits 0 only if all three modes agree". The variable name `ir` is the fossil: this script
    #       predates the deletion of modes 1-2, and when mode 2's flag went away the invocation was repointed
    #       to --run instead of to --compile, leaving a self-comparison behind.
    #   (2) the oracle branch read "${f%.pl}.ref" but corpus/tests/prolog stores .expected -- 0 rung*.ref vs
    #       26 *.expected on disk -- so `[ -f "$ref" ]` was never true and ORACLE_MISS=0 meant NO ORACLE WAS
    #       EVER CONSULTED, not "output is correct".
    #   (3) the rung loop pre-skipped any program whose --run exited non-zero, so a crash became SKIP, never
    #       FAIL -- it hid exactly the PZ-4 class this corpus exists to catch (25 SKIP vs 13 PASS).
    # Measured before the cure: PASS=13 FAIL=0 SKIP=25 ORACLE_MISS=0, exit 0, on a language whose own goal
    # file says its flagship row crashes with SIGILL. Authority: RULES.md INSTRUMENT LAWS fifth batch -- an
    # instrument that CANNOT FAIL is worse than no instrument, because it manufactures green.
    # ⭐ PER-MODE INDEPENDENT GRADING (RULES.md MODES MAY DIVERGE, Lon 2026-08-28): m3 and m4 are each graded
    # against the oracle on their own; a divergence between them is reported but is NOT itself a failure.
