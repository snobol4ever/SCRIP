# hq_prolog 2026-10-04 (the call-box row, ARCH-PROLOG-C-OUT-OF-THE-BOX section 9). The sibling of bench_prolog_call_census.sh, which
# counts CALL instructions into named runtime helpers; this one counts any instruction line (a registry jump's load of g_rt_gen_procs,
# the staging loop's `mov r9d, 4`), so a row whose DONE-WHEN is "that instruction leaves the emitted road" can measure it.
# GREEN (rc 0) at zero matches, RED (rc 1) otherwise, REFUSED (rc 2) when a kernel does not compile, the binary is missing, or the population is EMPTY
# (a corpus moved or an S4E_CORPUS pointing elsewhere must never read as a vacuous GREEN).
