#
# ⭐ WHY THIS EXISTS (CEO-567, RULES.md:321, ARCH-PROGRAM-LEDGER.md): the kernel's source holds the
#   COMPUTATION AND NOTHING ELSE; the wrapping and the messaging are GENERATED around a pristine source.
#   This is the Prolog twin of bench_wrap.sh, which has done the same job for SNOBOL4 since s265.
#
#   BEFORE (measured hq_P 2026-09-13, the state this script was written to end):
#     corpus/benchmarks/prolog/bench/ shipped TWO conventions in ONE directory -- 13 kernels were
#     pristine result-signature programs, and 10 baked a wall_us/wall_ms timing bracket into main/0.
#     ⛔ The 10 were UNMEASURABLE ON THE ENGINE UNDER MEASUREMENT: the rival arms consult
#     prelude_gplc.pl / prelude_swipl.pl, which define wall_us/1 and wall_ms/1, but SCRIP registers
#     wall_us and wall_ms at ARITY 0 ONLY (by_name_dispatch.c:2842, `nargs == 0`), so every one of the
#     ten raised existence_error(wall_us/1) -- AND EXITED 0, printing no answer.  A sweep counted that
#     as a run.  So the Prolog speed axis has been silently unmeasurable on SCRIP since the harness was
#     designed, while the rival columns kept reporting real numbers.
#     corpus/benchmarks/prolog/vanroy/ is the same 10+11 kernels with `main :- l__(64).` FROZEN into
#     each source -- the iteration count living inside the artifact under measurement.
#
#   AFTER: every corpus/benchmarks/prolog/bench/*.pl is a real standalone program that prints its own
#   oracle-graded answer and contains no timing and no iteration builtin.  This script builds the timed
#   or counted version into a temp file when someone wants a number.
#
# THE CONTRACT -- two things in the pristine kernel, both of which keep it standalone:
#
#     % *BENCH kernel=<name>                 one comment line, inert to every engine
#     bench_work(Res) :- <the computation>.  the work, and only the work
#     main :- bench_work(Res), write(Res), nl.
#
#   bench_work/1 is the bracket's content: the timing bracket encloses the CALL TO IT and nothing else,
#   so the published number is work-on-work and the write stays outside.  main/0 is what makes the file
#   a program rather than a fragment, and its stdout is what <name>.expected grades.
#
# ⭐ THREE ANGLES OVER ONE PRISTINE SOURCE (the same three bench_wrap.sh gives SNOBOL4):
#     --mode=single  the work ONCE, self-timed.  stdout is the kernel's real answer, so the run is
#                    GRADED and TIMED at once; work_us/work_ms go to user_error and stdout stays
#                    byte-comparable against <name>.expected.
#     --mode=iter    exactly --n=N iterations, no wall-clock deadline anywhere.  This is the arm for
#                    callgrind/cachegrind, where a deadline measures the INSTRUMENT's throughput
#                    instead of the kernel's (FINDING-2026-08-22-bench-harness-unmeasurable).
#                    ⛔ stdout is N copies of the answer ON PURPOSE -- that is what lets loop_check()
#                    in lib_prolog_bench.sh PROVE the loop looped before its time is divided by N.
#     --mode=time    (angle 3's companion) run the work until --bud ms is spent, COUNT the iterations.
#   The process wrapper -- /usr/bin/time, perf stat, callgrind around the whole run -- is angle 3 and
#   needs no generated file at all; its total minus the self-measured work IS the overhead number.
#
# ⛔ --engine names WHO WILL RUN THE OUTPUT, and it changes only the PRELUDE, never the kernel.
#   ⭐ The prelude is here rather than in the kernel because the KERNEL must be byte-identical across
#   every engine -- the kernel is the thing being compared.
#
# ✅⭐⭐ RETRACTED 2026-09-13 BY hq_P, BY EXECUTION: SCRIP'S PROLOG NOW HAS A WALL CLOCK, AND THE
#   PARAGRAPH BELOW IS KEPT ONLY FOR ITS HISTORY AND ITS LESSON.  The cto landed wall_us/1 and wall_ms/1
#   as real Prolog builtins at SCRIP 05317a5fb.  Verified HERE with NO prelude loaded, so it is SCRIP
#   answering and not a rival prelude's definition: m3 -> us(248130129882) ms(248130129), m4 -> the same
#   shape.  The script no longer believes either the old claim OR the new one: it PROBES the binary (see
#   the CLOCK block below) and both modes must answer before a bracket is emitted.
#   ⛔⭐ THE LESSON IS WHY THE WHOLE PARAGRAPH STAYS: the claim below was MEASURED, was TRUE the day it
#   was written, named its evidence and its commit -- and was still the thing that made this harness
#   wrong, because it was frozen into a CONSTANT (`CLOCK=1; [ "$ENGINE" = scrip ] && CLOCK=0`) sitting
#   under a comment that said "Measured, not assumed."  A measurement pasted into a constant stops being
#   a measurement the moment the world moves, and it keeps the authority of one.  That is the defect
#   class, not this one flag: TRUE-WHEN-WRITTEN IS NOT TRUE, AND A CAPABILITY IS ASKED, NEVER REMEMBERED.
# ⛔⛔ THE SUPERSEDED CLAIM (hq_P 2026-09-13, SCRIP 202d8bfff -- read as history, never as current state):
#   SCRIP'S PROLOG HAS NO WALL CLOCK AT ALL, AND THAT IS REPORTED, NOT PAPERED OVER
#   (MEASURED by execution, hq_P 2026-09-13, SCRIP 202d8bfff).  The row that sent this work up said the
#   defect was an ARITY mismatch -- wall_us registered at 0, called at 1.  It is worse than that: all
#   SIX spellings the three engines use raise on SCRIP --
#       wall_us/1 . wall_ms/1 . statistics/2 . real_time/1 . get_time/1  -> existence_error(procedure)
#       X is cputime . X is realtime                                     -> type_error(evaluable)
#   The `nargs == 0` wall_us/wall_ms at by_name_dispatch.c:2842 is SNOBOL4's BY-NAME dispatch and is not
#   reachable from Prolog at any arity, so registering a /1 twin there would not reach Prolog either.
#   ⭐ CONSEQUENCE FOR THE BASIS: the two-number WORK/OVERHEAD basis has NO work number on SCRIP's Prolog
#   arm.  Only the process wrapper (angle 3, external total) can produce a Prolog number on SCRIP today,
#   and an external total is a TOTAL -- it carries startup and may never share a column with a rival's
#   self-measured work (RULES.md, apples-to-apples: a SLOPE is not a TOTAL).
#   ⛔ So for --engine=scrip this script emits the counted form WITHOUT a bracket and says
#   work_us=UNAVAILABLE in the BENCH line.  It does NOT emit a bracket that raises and exits 0, which is
#   what the checked-in sources did: existence_error(wall_us/1) printed to stderr, no answer on stdout,
#   rc=0 -- a sweep counted that as a run.  A missing instrument is reported as missing.

# lives in the checkout -- `$ROOT/scrip` does not exist, and a probe that cannot find the binary answers

# ⭐ CLOCK is the per-engine wall-clock capability the two-number basis needs, and it is PROBED, NEVER
#   ASSUMED.  This spot used to read `CLOCK=1; [ "$ENGINE" = scrip ] && CLOCK=0` directly beneath a
#   comment that said "Measured, not assumed." -- a HARDCODED CAPABILITY ASSUMPTION that was true the day
#   it was written and became FALSE the moment the cto landed wall_us/1 and wall_ms/1 as real Prolog
#   builtins (SCRIP 05317a5fb).  It is replaced by a PROBE and not by the opposite constant on purpose:
#   a constant with the right value is the SAME DEFECT holding a luckier number, and the next capability
#   change would need another edit right here.  After this, it needs none.
#   ⛔ EACH ENGINE IS ASKED AT ITS OWN PROVIDER, because that is where the capability actually comes from:
#     gnu / swi -- the clock is supplied by the prelude THIS SCRIPT cats in, so the PRELUDE FILE is what
#                  is asked; a prelude that lost the definition is caught here instead of at run time.
#     scrip     -- nothing is catted in, so the BINARY is asked, by compiling and running a witness that
#                  carries NO prelude.  ⛔ A prelude-bearing witness can never testify about the builtin:
#                  it answers with get_time/1 out of the prelude and reads as a pass (hq_P made exactly
#                  this mistake once this row and nearly recorded the builtin as proven).
#   ⛔ BOTH MODES MUST ANSWER.  --engine=scrip names ONE generated artifact that angle 2 then runs under
#   m3 AND m4, so the clock must exist under both or the emitted bracket raises in whichever mode lacks
#   it -- which is precisely the existence_error-and-exit-0 silence this entire row exists to end.
#   The answer is cached under a fingerprint of the binary and the runtime it links, so a rebuild
#   re-probes by itself and the 23-kernel sweep pays for the probe once rather than 23 times.

      #   is bench_work's, not between/3's.  So for a NONDETERMINISTIC kernel the loop walks that kernel's

      #   lines at N=1.  All four read NA on every engine and vanished from angle 1's board.
