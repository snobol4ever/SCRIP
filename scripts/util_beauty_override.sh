# util_beauty_override.sh — ⭐ THE CLASS-A REPRODUCER (s183, HQ Fable): ablate beauty by overriding ONE grammar
# line, rather than building a standalone witness up from ingredients.
#
#   bash scripts/util_beauty_override.sh <Parse|Command|Stmt|Label|...> "<replacement text>" [stdin-file]
#
# ⛔ WHY THIS EXISTS AND WHY YOU SHOULD REACH FOR IT FIRST.  HQ tried NINE times to build a standalone witness
# for beauty's class-A SEGV out of its identified ingredients (an EVAL-built runtime-composed pattern reached
# through one and then two defer levels, followed by a variable operand, with and without FENCE).  EVERY ONE
# AGREED WITH THE ORACLE.  beauty's context — 16 includes, the ALPHABET block, the polluted name space — is
# LOAD-BEARING for this crash, exactly as the s178 fwctx conjunction was.  Reducing beauty DOWNWARD works where
# building UP does not, so this script is the cheap path: one line changed, one run, one verdict.
#
# It copies beauty.sno AND corpus/include/*.inc into one scratch dir (so the .inc files resolve -- they live in
# SEPARATE trees since the flattening; see BDIR/INCDIR below), rewrites the named grammar
# assignment INCLUDING its `+` continuation lines, runs SCRIP and the oracle on the same input, and prints both.

A BDIR-only repoint would have silenced the fossil gate while leaving this script broken on every invocation.
