# test_gate_icn_monitor_a_cset_value_crosses_the_wire_as_icx_sends_it.sh -- AN ICON CSET VALUE NEVER BREAKS THE MONITOR WIRE
# (hq_icon 2026-09-25, crawl work under CEO-1270 / CEO-1272).
#
# SCRIP carries a cset as a DT_S descriptor whose length field is the sentinel 0xFFFFFFFF (IS_CSET_fn; the registry knows the
# real length). core.c's two wire encoders typed it MWT_STRING and sent that sentinel as the value length, so the controller
# read "insane value_len 4294967295" and monitor_run.sh --oracle REFUSED with THE WIRE BROKE on the first cset assignment --
# seven graded Arizona programs (cset, case, coerce, concord, mffsol, mindfa, scan_lib_driver) could not be bracketed at all.
# A cset now goes on the wire as icx sends one (monitor_icx.c: a T_Cset falls to MWT_UNKNOWN with no bytes): UNGRADED on
# both sides, never a torn header.
#
# THE WITNESS assigns a cset and then an integer: the bracket must run to its end (AGREE or UNGRADED, never a REFUSE), and the
# cset's step must read UNGRADED. Red on the encoder before this change (the wire breaks at the cset's VALUE).
