#
# ⛔ THE DEFECT (ceo 2026-09-14, gimpel ASM_driver, row snobol4-gimpel-suite-126-to-100-percent-by-class).
# A capture is a VIEW: its descriptor's .s points INTO the subject and the length is CARRIED in .slen, so the
# bytes do not end at a NUL. Three numeric paths read .s raw and demanded the number end at '\0':
# bn_integer's scan, and the _OPCOERCE / _SNOCOERCE macros every numeric builtin in the dispatcher goes through.
# On `AC` captured as "1" out of "START LOAD 1,ONE " they walked into ",ONE " and concluded it was not a number.
#
# ⭐ WHAT MADE IT INVISIBLE FOR SO LONG, and the reason this gate tests FOUR paths rather than the one that broke:
# the TEMPLATE arithmetic path already honoured the carried length, so `AC + 1` was 2 and `SIZE(AC)` was 1 on the
# very same value that `INTEGER(AC)` called non-numeric. Two coercions for one language, disagreeing about what
# the value IS, with each one right on its own witness. A gate that held only INTEGER would have let the next
# builtin re-acquire the defect in silence.
#
# ⛔ AND THE SYMPTOM WAS NOWHERE NEAR THE CAUSE: ASM_driver printed a wrong REGISTER COLUMN and two spurious
# error causes, sixty lines of assembler listing away from any mention of numbers.
#
# THE EXPECTATIONS ARE CUT FROM THE ORACLE (`sbl -bf`), not from our output -- each line below was produced by
# the oracle on this exact witness before the cure existed. NO BUILD NEEDED beyond ./scrip already being built.
# rc=0 clean · rc=1 a coercion path disagrees · rc=2 REFUSAL (cannot measure).
