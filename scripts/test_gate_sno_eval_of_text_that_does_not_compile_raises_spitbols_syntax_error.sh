# SPITBOL'S RULE (sbl.min scane scn07-scn51 and expan exp02-exp24, read by the cfo 2026-10-02 for ceo CEO-1419's ticket
# snobol4-eval-of-text-that-does-not-compile-raises-spitbols-syntax-error-where-scrip-fails-the-eval): EVAL of text that
# does not compile RAISES the scanner's or the expression parser's syntax error, numbered 220-233, with its own &ERRTEXT.
# Under SETEXIT it is trapped; at &ERRLIMIT > 0 it is counted; at &ERRLIMIT 0 the EVAL simply fails and the run goes on.
# That is the stage rule (CEO-1322): the compile of EVAL's text runs under stage stgee. SCRIP used to FAIL the EVAL
# silently with &ERRTEXT 'parse error: syntax error'. Found by Lon's infinite_snobol4 demo: 11,285 of 20,000 random
# expressions read this way.
# THE CURE (runtime_eval.c rt_eval_syntax_raise): when SCRIP's own parser has REJECTED the text, eval_sb_syntax runs
# SPITBOL's element rules and three-state expression machine over it and names the first error SPITBOL would raise.
# Text SCRIP accepts is never classified, so no EVAL that works today changes. A position the port does not model (a
# ';' or ':' outside an open paren, a binary '=') is declined, and the EVAL fails as before.
# NOT COVERED, AND WHY: text SCRIP's parser ACCEPTS where SPITBOL rejects it (1/TAB(2), &BAL** '0', 1.5- 10,
# 99999999999999999999) is a different class: the parser's leniency, not this raise. A name operator or assignment
# whose target is not a name (1 . 2, 1 = 2, sbl 212) is a lowering FATAL in SCRIP, another class.
#
# Each arm grades the evaluator's line for one text, both modes, against sbl -bf cut AT RUN TIME. The run stays under
# 32 trapped errors, because a trap still nests (ticket snobol4-setexit-trapped-errors-leak-stack-to-error-246-and-stop-
# raising-after-32). rc=0 clean · rc=1 a divergence · rc=2 REFUSAL.
