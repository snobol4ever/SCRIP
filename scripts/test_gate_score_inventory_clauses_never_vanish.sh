# scripts/test_gate_score_inventory_clauses_never_vanish.sh -- NO PACKAGE EVER LOSES ITS PACKAGE_INVENTORY
# CLAUSE FROM SCORE.md, BY ANY PATH.
# AUTHORS: Lon Jones Cherryholmes · Claude Opus 5   DATE: 2026-09-08
#
# ⛔⭐⭐ THE FAILURE IS INVISIBLE, WHICH IS THE WHOLE REASON THIS EXISTS. util_score_row.py's
# inventory_clauses() keeps the LAST `PACKAGE_INVENTORY package=X shipped= graded= ungraded= ungradable=`
# clause per package and feeds the September-10 progress readers their GRADED POPULATION. A dropped clause
# therefore DOES NOT READ AS MISSING: the package silently stops contributing a population, and the
# percentage above it still prints, confidently and wrongly. Absence and correctness look identical.
#
# TWO OCCURRENCES, TWO CANDIDATE PATHS, AND NEITHER REPORTER OVERCLAIMED (this is why it is a gate and not
# a fix): hq_C measured `package=gimpel` present at .github 932016de and absent immediately after its row
# closed, with every other package in the SAME cell intact -- then read origin and RETRACTED its own
# diagnosis, because hq_V had independently pushed 1540781a describing the identical shape on snoflake and
# attributing it to a CONFLICT RESOLUTION. One occurrence each, and hq_C's had been through several
# conflicted rebases of SCORE.md before anyone looked. ⭐ Two mechanisms that produce one symptom cannot be
# told apart by the symptom -- so this gate does not try. It asserts the OUTCOME, and it is blind to route.
#
# ⭐ WHY A PINNED FLOOR AND NOT A BEFORE/AFTER DIFF. The in-process guard in util_score_row.py
# (_write_score_md) already refuses a write that drops a key -- but it can only see writes THROUGH that
# tool, and the one path actually confirmed tonight was a git rebase, which never runs it. A floor in a
# gate is route-independent: hand edit, conflicted merge, `done` hook, or a future writer nobody has
# written yet all land the same way.
#
# ⛔ THE FLOOR ONLY EVER GROWS. A package appearing is normal and re-pins here. A package DISAPPEARING is
# the defect, and raising the floor to make this gate pass is the one edit that voids it -- if a package is
# genuinely retired, that is a ruling, and the ruling removes it from this list in the same commit that
# removes it from the corpus.
# EXIT: 0 every pinned package still carries a clause · 1 one or more vanished · 2 REFUSED (no SCORE.md).
