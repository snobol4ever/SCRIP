# test_gate_picker_lane_table_agrees_with_mode.sh -- the picker's language->owner table is a SECOND COPY of
# MODE line 2, and this is what keeps the copy honest.
#
# ⛔⭐ THE MEASURED CASE (ceo CEO-672, 2026-09-13; re-measured independently by hq_B before acting on it).
# `s4e_topic_lane`'s language fallback was a FLEET-era map that NONET invalidated wholesale. SIX OF SEVEN
# languages named a seat that does not own them: icon->hq_B where Icon is the ceo · snobol4->hq_P where it is
# the cfo · snocone->hq_P where it is hq_I · pascal->hq_P where it is the coo · rebus->hq_T where it is hq_S ·
# prolog->hq_C where the cto owns completeness. Exactly one, raku->hq_T, was still right.
# ⛔ IT FAILED IN BOTH DIRECTIONS AT ONCE, which is why it ran for as long as NONET had been open: `next`
# served rows to seats that do not own them AND skipped them for the seats that do. hq_S watched it skip
# thirty rows before locking a SNOBOL4 row it then released unworked. A dispatcher that is wrong in one
# direction starves a lane loudly; wrong in both, every seat sees a plausible queue and nobody sees a gap.
#
# ⭐⭐ WHY THIS IS A GATE AND NOT A DERIVATION, WHICH IS THE PART WORTH ARGUING. The ceo offered both and left
# the choice here. Deriving the owner from MODE line 2 at call time sounds strictly better -- no copy, no rot.
# ⛔ IT WAS MEASURED AND REJECTED. The only parseable ownership shape in line 2 is the phrase "THE SEATS: RAKU
# -- hq_T; ... ICON -- the ceo", and `grep -c 'THE SEATS:'` over the MODE backups says it appears in ONE of the
# last TEN versions: line 2 is prose whose phrasing is reinvented at every mode cut. A parser over it would
# have found nothing for nine of ten modes and fallen back to the hardcoded table -- today's bug, with
# machinery on top and a false claim of freshness. ⭐ The general form: you cannot derive a fact from a
# document that does not promise to state it the same way twice. What you CAN do is refuse to be silently
# wrong about it, which is this gate.
# ⭐ THE REAL CURE IS UPSTREAM AND IS AN ASK, NOT A LANDING: MODE line 1 is machine-readable and line 2 is not.
# A machine-readable lane field would let the picker derive at call time and delete the copy for good. Until
# that exists, this gate is the honest second-best, and it says so rather than pretending to be the first.
#
# THE THREE EXIT CODES (lib_gate.sh's rule): 0 agree · 1 DISAGREE, naming the language and both owners ·
# 2 could-not-measure (MODE unreadable, or line 2 carries no ownership statement this can parse).
# ⛔ rc=2 IS NOT A PASS AND IS NOT A FAILURE. "MODE line 2 does not say who owns Snocone in a shape I can read"
# is a fact about the MODE file, not about the table; spelling it rc=1 would blame the wrong file and train
# seats to edit the table until the gate goes quiet.
