"""util_gc_audit_b_receipt.py -- THE ONE READER OF A PASS-B LOG AGAINST THE HOLDER LEDGER (cfo 2026-09-27, CEO-1307).

    util_gc_audit_b_receipt.py holders ERRFILE SO DECL      the auditor gate's listing: HOLDER <name> <count> <ledger status>,
                                                             then OPENROWS and TOTALHOLDERS (the gate greps these lines)
    util_gc_audit_b_receipt.py receipt LOG SO [DECL]        an HQ's receipt: candidates=N findings=M audited=A, one UNCLOSED
                                                             line per holder that counts, rc 0 when findings=0, rc 1 otherwise

WHY ONE FILE.  CEO-1307 ruled that a receipt of the auditor-retirement row counts FINDINGS, the candidates whose holder the
ledger does not close, beside the raw CANDIDATE count kept visible -- ARCH-GC section 9's grant counts only findings that
survived the lane owner's reading.  The auditor gate already resolved holders this way inline; a second copy for the receipts
would be the drift this fleet keeps paying for, so the gate calls this file and so does every HQ.

HOW A HOLDER IS NAMED.  A candidate line carries in=<module>+0x<offset>/<symbol-or-region> for a static (dladdr cannot name a
file-local static, so the offset is resolved through nm -S on the SAME auditor library that produced the log) and in=<region>
for a stack word (cstack, parked, ...), and in=- for a word inside an opaque heap block.  A function-local static's per-unit
serial (lnv.3) is dropped, because it moves whenever its file gains or loses a static.

WHAT CLOSES A HOLDER.  holders mode reports the ledger status as the gate has always read it.  receipt mode counts a candidate
as a FINDING unless its holder is DECLARED: an UNDECLARED holder, an OPEN row, and a CURED holder named again (REGRESSED -- a
receipt certifies that the cure still holds) all count.  Statics and heap interiors are never declared by population (CEO-1307
(iii)); the stack populations are, with their measured classes in the ledger's reasons.

Deleted with the auditor: it is on the retirement row's deletion list.
