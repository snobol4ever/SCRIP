# test_gate_gc_a_coexpression_frame_image_lives_on_its_own_stack.sh -- rung 2 of the coexpression rows (cto, 2026-09-19,
# MODE TRIO; row gc-the-collector-walks-the-rbp-chain-...-and-coexpression-stacks-are-mapped-frames, first cut; Lon
# 2026-09-19 in-chat: "When I say frame, I am referring to STANDING-ACTIVATION (root RBP frame), ACTIVATION frames (RBP
# frames nested under STANDING or other ACTIVATION frames), and the SPINE (RSP)." and "If frames are being allocated on
# the HEAP then delete that code, because we do not do that here.").
#
# WHAT WAS THERE. scrip_coexpr_create copied the creator's ACTIVATION frame image ([regs[5]-below, +frame_bytes+below))
# into a ct_alloc arena block (frame_copy), registered that block as a GC root range (word-swept every collection), and
# the trampoline copied it onto the co-expression's own thread stack at first activation; the arena block lived on only
# so that ^e (scrip_coexpr_refresh) could re-create the co-expression from its creation-time image. Frame bytes off the
# RSP/RBP stack, in a region the collector had to guess about.
#
# WHAT IS HERE. The co-expression's thread is created EAGERLY at `create`: the new thread reserves the image on ITS OWN
# stack (the pristine image), copies the creator's live frame into it while the creator blocks on a `created` semaphore,
# then waits for activation; the entry asm carves the working frame below and copies from that on-stack image exactly
# as it copied from the arena block; ^e reads the old co-expression's on-stack image (Icon co-expressions are never
# destroyed). frame_copy, its size and below fields, the rt_gc_root_range_add of the block and its ct_drop are gone. The
# lazily started generator contexts of rt.c (scrip_co_ctx_init) are untouched. The pristine image is a frame-shaped root
# on the thread's stack (it carries the creator's map cell): the segment walk reads it like any frame.
#
# ARMS. (1) STRUCTURE: no frame_copy, no arena copy of frame bytes, no root-range registration in rt_coexpr.c; the eager
# fields exist. (2) REFRESH: hb_coexpr_refresh.icn (two activations, then ^e restarts from the creation-time image while
# every block moves) matches its iconx-cut ref at SCRIP_GC_STRESS=1,3,5,8 under SCRIP_GC_PLANT_SHIFT=4096 in BOTH modes.
# (3) ARIZONA: coexpr.icn (image(^e), sixty co-expression operations) prints the same stdout as icont at stress 0 and 5
# (58 lines; its &errout trace is the ceo's rowed finding, not graded here). (4) MEASURED, NOT ASSERTED: the reporter's
# images_on_stack counts every context whose image address lies inside its own thread's stack mapping and
# images_off_stack reads 0 on the refresh witness. (5) the uncreated-thread gate holds both contracts (lazy refused,
# eager already has its stack). (6) hb_coexpr_genp_scan.icn -- a generator called by VALUE inside a scan (rt.c's lazily
# started generator thread) keeps the caller's scan environment across its first yield back to main, both modes, stress
# 0,1,3,5 under the shift plant: the fail-once of rung 2's first cut, whose `started` flag read main's context as never
# started and reset the scan environment on that yield (IcnM 825/826, procedure_suspend_scan_replace_1, both modes).
