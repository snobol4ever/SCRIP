# lib_ir_measure.sh -- ⭐ THE ONE AUTHORITY for TAKING a callgrind Ir reading.
#
# THE RULE IT IMPLEMENTS (hq_P 2026-09-10, on hq_U's ask that this shape become the rule for EVERY Ir
# cell and not just the one that caught it; FINDING-2026-09-10-hq_P-both-icon-modes-segv-under-valgrind-
# in-gc-zeta-frame-while-running-clean-natively.md):
#
#   ⛔⭐ AN Ir READING FROM A RUN THAT DIED IS NOT A MEASUREMENT, AND IT MUST NOT LOOK LIKE ONE.
#   callgrind counts instructions whatever the client does, so a program that SEGVs, parse-errors or
#   is killed by a timeout still hands back a perfectly well-formed PROGRAM TOTALS -- the instruction
#   count of its dying path.  It is the same shape as every honest cell on the board and nothing in
#   the output says otherwise.  ⭐ A CRASH THAT ANNOUNCES ITSELF AS A NUMBER IS STRICTLY WORSE THAN
#   ONE THAT ANNOUNCES ITSELF AS A HOLE (hq_U, 2026-09-10).
#
# ⛔ AND THE REASON IS *NOT* NON-DETERMINISM -- that argument is weaker than it looks and this file
# would be wrong to rest on it.  MEASURED hq_P 2026-09-10 with a C program that sums 200,000 ints and
# then writes through a null pointer: three crashed runs under a FIXED argv+env read 2,157,204 Ir
# THREE TIMES, byte-identical.  A crashed reading can be perfectly reproducible.  The Icon
# concat_table case that opened this row DID disagree run to run (330,078,095 vs 330,079,909), but
# that is a property of THAT program -- its fault point moves with heap and GC state -- not of dead
# runs in general.  ⭐ THE REAL ARGUMENT IS SIMPLER AND ALWAYS HOLDS: the number counts a path that
# did not do the work, so it does not answer the question the column asks.  Reproducing it exactly
# only makes it a reliable answer to the wrong question.
#
# ⛔ THREE OUTCOMES, NEVER TWO.  "not measured" and "measured and thrown away" are different facts and
# a board that prints one `NA` for both has destroyed the difference.  The first cut of the Icon
# kernel harness printed a bare NA for a SIGSEGV and no warning at all, because the status was carried
# out of the measuring function in a global that could not survive the command substitution calling it.
# ⭐ SO THE STATUS RIDES IN THE VALUE, never in a global and never in a return code that a `$( )` eats.
#
# USAGE
#   . "$(dirname "$0")/lib_ir_measure.sh"        # a caller that cannot load this REFUSES, never
#                                                #   falls back to a private extraction (lib_perf_fmt law)
#   v="$(ir_measure ./prog arg ...)"             # runs it under callgrind; NEVER dies, NEVER unset
#   ir_is_number "$v" && use "$v"                # the only sanctioned way to ask "may I grade this?"
#   ir_cell "$v"                                 # -> "2157204" | "REFUSED(rc=139)" | "NOT-MEASURED(valgrind-absent)"
#   ir_reason "$v"                               # -> the one-line why, for stderr; empty for a good reading
#
#   IR_TMO       seconds for the whole callgrind run (default 600 -- callgrind is ~50x native)
#   IR_OUT       optional path to keep the callgrind.out file at; default is a temp that is removed
#   IR_PROG_OUT  optional path to keep the CLIENT's stdout at   \  ⛔ USE THESE, never a `>` on the call:
#   IR_PROG_ERR  optional path to keep the CLIENT's stderr at   /  the reading is this function's OWN stdout,
#                so `v="$(ir_measure ./p > run.out)"` sends the READING into run.out and comes back empty.
#   IR_VG_FLAGS  extra valgrind flags, word-split (e.g. --smc-check=all-non-file for runtime-emitted blobs).
#                ⛔ It exists so a caller with a special need still comes through here instead of running its
#                own callgrind -- a private call site is exactly what this file was written to end.
