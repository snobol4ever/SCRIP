# instruments-claim-and-next-announce-the-start-of-work-to-every-standing-seat).
#
# ⛔⭐ THE DEFECT IS IN THE BUS, NOT IN A SEAT. claim and next LOCKED A ROW SILENTLY: the bus had claim, assign, ask
# and send, and not one of them told another seat that work had STARTED -- so the only instrument that ever reported
# a collision was a branch that would not fast-forward. WITNESS, self-reported by hq_snobol4 2026-09-20: they measured
# the no_layout census for an hour, the cto spent their own hour on the same 30 entries and the same cause and landed
# first at SCRIP 83fb80ee7, and hq_snobol4 found out on a failed pull. BOTH SEATS HELD ROWS. The rows did not overlap
# BY NAME and did overlap BY POPULATION -- which a claim on a topic string can never catch.
# ⛔ LON, IN-CHAT TO THE ceo, VERBATIM: "Them not telegramming before starting is YOUR FAULT! You set up the system."
# The ceo's own first draft of the law read TELEGRAM THE LANE WHEN YOU START and they retracted it in the same
# ruling: a rule that converts a structural gap into an instruction is obeyed for a week and then not. So what is
# graded here is MECHANISM -- what the bus does when a seat takes a row -- and never a discipline.
#
# ⛔⭐ THE STOOD-DOWN HALF IS NOT A COURTESY, IT IS THE OTHER DIRECTION OF THE SAME TEST (arm 2). "Announce to every
# standing seat" is only meaningful if a stood-down seat is NOT announced to: a notice in a mailbox nobody is reading
# is the noise that trains seats to stop reading notices, and an implementation that mails every mailbox passes arm 1
# and fails here. The roster comes from s4e_mode_stands, the ONE dispatch authority `next` itself refuses on.
#
# ⛔ EVERY ARM IS HERMETIC: its own scratch postoffice, its own MODE, its own queue and batons. It never reads the live
# MODE, never touches a real inbox, and builds nothing.
