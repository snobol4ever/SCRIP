# util_donewhen_rc_census.py -- THE ONE AUTHORITY for "can this DONE-WHEN tell a refusal from a red".
# hq_B 2026-09-13, on the ceo audit FINDING-2026-09-11-ceo-a-done-when-that-captures-a-board-turns-could-not-
# measure-into-failed.md. Two classes, both found by that audit, both cured in place by this script's --cure.
# CLASS A -- a DONE-WHEN captures a runner's output and never consults that runner's rc. Under ONE RUNNER, ONE
#   BOARD a runner answers any seat but the coo with rc=2 REFUSE; the criterion captures that TEXT, the marker
#   grep misses, and a refusal degrades into rc=1 FAILED. The row is fine and the audit reads it as red.
# CLASS B -- a DONE-WHEN pins a SEAT ROOT in the text the bus actually runs, so the criterion grades whichever
#   tree that seat happens to hold rather than origin HEAD. TWO SPELLINGS, one class:
#   (i) the S4E_HOME FALLBACK (${S4E_HOME:-/home/claude_cfo}) -- `s4e_msg.sh done` exports S4E_HOME so the
#       fallback never fires there; it fires exactly when a seat runs the criterion BY HAND to audit it, and
#       then it silently grades ANOTHER SEAT'S TREE and can print PASS.
#   (ii) the BARE form (`cd /home/claude_ceo/SCRIP && ...`, `bash /home/claude_T/SCRIP/scripts/x.sh`) -- coo
#       2026-09-23 on CEO-1163, RULES.md THE INSTRUMENT LAWS thirty-fourth batch clause 3: a criterion that
#       names a seat root names a tree. It has NO fallback at all, so it does not even degrade.
#   ⛔ 28 of the 46 found at that landing pin a root that HAS NOT EXISTED SINCE CEO-767 (the lettered
#   /home/claude_{B,C,I,P,R,S,T,U} and the numbered /home/claude01..20). Those grade no tree whatever, and the
#   direction they fail in is NOT always visible: `rung-gate-false-green-audit`'s criterion is
#   `! grep -qi ... /home/claude10/.github/FINDING-...md`, and grep's rc=2 on a missing file INVERTS to rc=0 --
#   a row that closes DONE on an evidence file that has not existed for a month. Measured, not reasoned.
# +-- WHAT THIS DOES NOT CALL A DEFECT, WHICH IS THE HALF THAT TOOK THE WORK -------------------------------+
# A capture that never looks at rc but REFUSES rc=2 when the expected marker is absent can already tell "never
# ran" from "ran and red" -- it grades a marker instead of a status, which is a different correct answer, not a
# worse one. 50 criteria are that shape. Calling them defective and "curing" them would be this row's own
# lesson inverted: an instrument answering a narrower question than it thinks it asked. They are counted and
# printed as HONEST and never rewritten.
# +-- AND THE TRAP INSIDE THE CURE --------------------------------------------------------------------------+
# 19 of the defective captures PIPE the runner into grep/tail. For those, appending `rc=$?` reads THE PIPE's
# status, not the runner's -- the $?-after-a-pipeline trap, i.e. the cure would wear the defect's own shape.
# Those are restructured instead: capture raw, check rc, THEN filter.
# The inserted guard is a BRACE GROUP ending in `[ "$_dwrc" = 0 ]` so a capture sitting inside an `&&` chain
# keeps its short-circuit exactly; appending `; _dwrc=$?` bare would silently break the chain.
# ⛔ IT NEVER EXECUTES A CRITERION and never expands one. Static text only.
