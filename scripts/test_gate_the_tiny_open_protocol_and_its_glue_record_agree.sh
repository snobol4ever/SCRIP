# test_gate_the_tiny_open_protocol_and_its_glue_record_agree.sh -- TWO FILES HOLD ONE CONTRACT AND NOTHING BOUND THEM.
#
# ⛔⭐ THE DEFECT, MEASURED BY THE ceo AT THE COST OF TWO FAILED CONVERSION ATTEMPTS (CEO-1089, cured by the cto
# 2026-09-21 as spine).  rt_call_open_by_name returns a two-word {entry, protocol}; the protocol's low byte is `how`.
# bb_glue_enter_c2bb performs the jump, and its how==2 arm (the TINY/alpha record) built a FIXED 48-byte record whose
# ARGUMENT COUNT WAS THE LITERAL ZERO and which never copied g_call_args.  rt_tiny_record_enter's own asm shim -- the
# other way into the same target -- sizes its record FROM nargs, copies every argument out of g_call_args, and writes
# the real count.  So the two roads into one callee disagreed about the record's shape.
# ⛔ IT PRESENTED AS A WRONG ANSWER, NOT A CRASH: a target opened onto how=2 with arguments entered WITH NO ARGUMENTS and
# read unbound parameters (the ceo measured APPLY(ZFN,41) returning 1 instead of 42).  The 2026-09-21 cure made the open
# take the tiny road ONLY at nargs<=0 and sent an argument-bearing call down the NAMED road.
# ⛔ AND THAT WORKAROUND CRASHED A SNOCONE FUNCTION (the cto, 2026-10-03, row snocone-apply-of-a-snocone-defined-function-
# crashes-scrip): for a Snocone function p->fn IS its tiny alpha, so APPLY('f', 2) took the named road (how=1, the glue
# jumps with rcx = a continuation label) into a prologue that reads its call record through rcx -- a GP fault in the slab.
# ⭐ THE BETTER CURE, LANDED THEN: the glue's how==2 arm hands its record (gamma and omega at [8] and [16]) to the
# trampoline rt_tiny_glue_enter (src/runtime/rt/rt_asm_helpers.S, jump-entered, box to asm to box), which takes the count
# from the how word (rt_c2bb_word(p, afn, 2, nargs) puts it in bits 8-39), builds the callee's record below the glue's --
# count, its own gamma/omega stubs, one offset per argument -- copies every argument out of g_call_args beside it, jumps to
# the alpha, and on return drops that frame and jumps on to the glue's continuation.  The nargs guard is LIFTED.
# THIS GATE holds the contract across the three files: the glue reaches the trampoline, the trampoline sizes from the count
# and copies g_call_args, and the open no longer guards how=2 on nargs -- or, if the glue ever goes back to a fixed
# zero-count record that copies nothing, the guard must return.  FAIL_ONCE=1 pretends the guard is still there.
