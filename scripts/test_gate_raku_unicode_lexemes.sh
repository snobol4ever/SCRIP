# test_gate_raku_unicode_lexemes.sh -- Raku is a UNICODE-NATIVE language and the lexer must not reject a
# non-ASCII byte in CODE position (hq_raku 2026-09-16, row raku-every-roast-file-run-graded-against-rakudo).
#
# ⛔⭐ THE DEFECT THIS GATE HOLDS CLOSED. raku.l's catch-all rule answered EVERY byte it did not recognise with
# "unexpected char", and every UTF-8 lead/continuation byte lands there. Measured on the roast tree at
# SCRIP 3b79683b5: 176 of 1464 files carry non-ASCII, 1525 DISTINCT non-ASCII characters appear, and the two
# commonest by a wide margin are the French quotes (17280 and 16941 occurrences). A Unicode operator or
# quote in code position did not fail with a diagnostic naming it -- it failed as a stray byte.
# ⭐⭐ AND THE SECOND-ORDER DAMAGE IS THE WORSE HALF: an unrecognised QUOTE does not merely fail, it swallows
# the code inside it and the parser dies somewhere downstream on a line that is perfectly good Raku. The
# witness that found this: 6.c/MISC/bug-coverage-stress.t was censused as blocked by `print 'STR';` -- and
# `print 'hi';` compiled ALONE parses clean, rc=0. So a first-error census keyed on the reported line blames
# an innocent construct, and the blame lands far from the cause.
# ⛔ WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT CURED, so a later reader does not mistake silence for coverage: UNICODE
# IDENTIFIERS (my $delta-as-a-Greek-letter) are still refused. Broadening the lexer's ALPHA class to the whole
# high-byte range would make every unimplemented Unicode operator lex as an IDENTIFIER instead of erroring --
# a SILENT ACCEPT, which is worse than a parse error because it leaves the debt column without moving the
# parser. That arm stays red on purpose and is named below rather than skipped.
# ⛔ EVERY ARM IS GRADED AGAINST THE ORACLE (rakudo), never against our own output, and REFUSES rc=2 when the
# oracle is absent rather than printing a board it could not measure.
