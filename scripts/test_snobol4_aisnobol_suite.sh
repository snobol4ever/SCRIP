# hq_T doorbell 2026-09-04, Lon verbatim: "You make the programs run, you measure the output, make a REF file,
# and place it into a ONE-LINER or a MULTI-LINER Python test harness."). SUPERSEDES the live-oracle-diff
# version of this script (git history holds it): the ALL.sno/ALL.ref container is built once by
# util_build_package_suite.py, with refs CUT FROM THE ORACLE (never hand-typed, never SCRIP's own output --
# see that script's header for the exclusion reasons), and this script becomes a thin face over the one
# suite grammar/grading authority (corpus_suite_harness.py) instead of a second, hand-rolled comparison
# loop duplicating oracle-invocation logic that already lives there.
#
# Regenerate the container (only needed if the shipped programs or the oracle changed):
#   python3 scripts/util_build_package_suite.py ../corpus/packages/snobol4/aisnobol
#
# Population: 8 shipped .sno programs. absorbed + excluded == shipped is asserted by the builder itself
# (refuses otherwise) -- not re-checked here, this script only grades what the container already holds.

# ⭐ THE SPITBOL BASELINE, MEASURED LIVE (Lon 2026-09-08; ceo ruling 18:49 on this seat's own ask). This runner
# is a thin face over the harness and never ran the oracle per program, so unlike the other package runners it
# had NO live outside set to record -- the shortcut was to declare one from ORACLE_ACCEPTANCE.tsv beside the
# package. THE CEO REFUSED THAT and was right on the facts: a cross-check that reads the file it is checking
# proves nothing, and that file names SPITCORE and spitlib.spt while a live pass names SPITCORE and BUILDLIB.
# ⛔ EACH PROGRAM IS RUN WITH ITS OWN .IN AND .argv. A pass that skips them manufactures refusals: the first
# such pass here flagged HSORT with ERROR 116 purely because it had not supplied HSORT.argv, and a manufactured
# refusal SHRINKS THE DENOMINATOR, which is the direction that flatters us.
# ⛔ THE ORACLE IS RESOLVED HERE, because this runner never had one: it delegates grading to the harness and
# had no SBL/FLAGS of its own. The first cut of this block copied those names from the testpgms runner, where
# they exist, so the oracle command expanded to nothing, every program produced no output, nothing was detected
# as refused, and the cross-check below dutifully reported the RECORD as stale. It reported a disagreement
# rather than a false agreement, which is the only reason the mistake was cheap -- accessors, never a
# hand-assembled path.
