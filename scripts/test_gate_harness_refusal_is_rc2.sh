# test_gate_harness_refusal_is_rc2.sh -- THE ACCEPTANCE GATE for row harness-refusal-exit-code-unified-on-rc-2
# (ceo CEO-233 -> hq_T 2026-09-04, minted on hq_T's own receipt: two refusal codes in one harness).
#
# THE DEFECT: corpus_suite_harness.py's refuse() exited rc=3 by this file's own local convention, while
# lib_gate.sh's three-code ladder and every bash gate say a refusal is rc=2 -- 0 measured-and-clean · 1
# measured-and-red · 2 COULD NOT MEASURE. It became untenable when the stale-binary preflight landed IN the
# harness (row harness-and-ladder-runner-refuse-on-a-stale-binary-...) and correctly exited 2: one tool then
# carried TWO refusal codes, so no caller could ask "did it refuse?" without knowing which refusal it hit.
#
# ⛔ THE POINT OF THIS GATE IS THAT rc=1 MUST NOT MOVE. Unifying refusals downward onto 2 is one edit away from
# collapsing "could not measure" into "measured and red", which is the false-green this whole harness exists to
# prevent -- so ARM 3 grades a REAL suite with a REAL red and asserts rc=1 survives, and ARM 4 asserts a clean
# suite still exits 0. A gate that only proved "refusals are 2" would pass on a harness that returned 2 for
# everything.
#
# ARMS: 1 behavioural refusal (missing suite file) -> rc=2 · 2 the source carries ZERO sys.exit(3) arms and
# refuse() exits 2 · 3 a red board still exits 1 (the distinction that must survive) · 4 a clean run still
# exits 0 · 5 the staleness refusal, which was already 2, is unchanged -- both refusal paths now agree.
# ⛔⭐ CEO-547 PART 2 (cto, 2026-09-11): arms 4, 6, 7, 8 and 9 graded the corpus master itself, so ONE RUNNER, ONE
# BOARD (CEO-523) refused each of them rc=2 on every seat but the coo -- THIS GATE was why `make test` was red for
# twelve of thirteen seats, and two of the five arms read GREEN off that wrong rc. Every grading arm now runs on
# this gate's own fixtures under $W, outside the corpus tree, and the two arms that could not distinguish one
# rc=2 from another assert what the refusal SAYS. Arm 4's rc check was also dead code (a line-continuation
# detached its `else`), which is why the banner claimed 16 checks and 15 ran; it is 18 now.
# ⭐ ARMS 6-9 ADDED 2026-09-10 (hq_T, row corpus-suite-harness-run-without-lang-silently-regrades-...): a suite
# pair whose suffix names a dialect REFUSES rc=2 without --lang, in `run` AND in `pin-ref`, and the refusal names
# the flag instead of accusing the corpus · the explicit `--lang snobol4` escape hatch still reaches the
# line-per-entry reader · and a .sno pair with no --lang is untouched, which is the arm that catches a guard
# written too wide (it would red the SNOBOL4 master for the whole fleet).
# EXIT: 0 all arms · 1 an arm failed · 2 REFUSED (no python3/harness/master, or an unbuilt tree).
