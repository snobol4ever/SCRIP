# test_gate_score_md_parses_and_github_is_marker_free.sh — the second half of the conflict-marker guard
# (row `make-test-refuses-when-score-md-is-unparseable-or-a-tracked-github-file-carries-a-conflict-marker`,
# ceo CEO-370 rank 1, minted from hq_R's blocker).
#
# ⛔⭐⭐ WHY A SECOND GUARD, WHEN THE PRE-COMMIT HOOK ALREADY REFUSES MARKERS. The hook grades the commit in
# front of it, in the root where it is installed, and hooks DO NOT PROPAGATE THROUGH CLONE. It cannot see
# what already reached origin, it cannot see a --no-verify, and it cannot see a seat whose hook was never
# installed. This arm grades the TREE every seat actually pulled. The two are authoring-time and
# landing-time halves of one property; neither replaces the other.
#
# ⛔ THE INCIDENT, measured 2026-09-06: a SCORE.md landed carrying conflict markers. util_score_row.py could
# not find its table, so every runner's row-write failed -- and THE LEADERBOARD WRITER WAS DEAD FOR AN HOUR
# WHILE EVERY BOARD STILL READ GREEN. That is not a bug in either component. `gate_score_row` is non-fatal
# BY DESIGN so that a bookkeeping failure never reds somebody's board, which is right; and a corrupt shared
# file is invisible to a board, which is also expected. THE HOLE IS THE COMPOSITION: the writer may fail
# quietly AND the file may be corrupt, so nothing anywhere says so. A failed WRITE must not red a board; a
# corrupt LEADERBOARD must. This gate is that distinction, made mechanical.
#
# THE TWO VERDICTS ARE DIFFERENT ON PURPOSE (ceo's spec):
#   rc=2  the table cannot be found or parsed -- this gate CANNOT MEASURE, so it REFUSES rather than
#         inventing a verdict. An unparseable board is not a failing board; it is an unreadable one.
#   rc=1  a tracked .github file carries a column-zero conflict marker -- that IS a defect, and a real one.
#
# ⛔ IT SOURCES util_score_row.py's OWN find_table RATHER THAN REIMPLEMENTING IT. A second definition of
# "is this table readable" would drift from the one every runner actually calls, and the drift would be
# silent in exactly the direction that lets a corrupt board through. Shape is the identity, never position:
# SCORE.md carries more than one '| Language |' header and binding to the first killed this helper
# fleet-wide once already.
#
# Usage: bash scripts/test_gate_score_md_parses_and_github_is_marker_free.sh
