# test_gate_pl_read_raises_catchable_syntax_error.sh — read/1, read/2, read_term/2,3 must raise a CATCHABLE
# syntax_error on malformed input instead of handing back a plausible WRONG term (row
# prolog-read-2-returns-a-plausible-wrong-term-on-malformed-input-instead-of-raising-syntax-error, hq_R 2026-09-06).
#
# WHAT THIS PINS. ISO/IEC 13211-1 § 8.14.1 (read_term/3) says a term that cannot be parsed raises syntax_error.
# SCRIP did two different wrong things, both silent, and they share one cure surface in the reader:
#   (1) INPUT THAT ENDS WITHOUT AN END TOKEN returned a plausible WRONG TERM. pl_read_term_text() returned "got a
#       term" on EOF, and pl_parse_term_text() wraps the text as '$rd'(TEXT) -- so the wrap's own closing paren
#       silently closed the user's unclosed one. `foo(a,b` read back as foo(a,b), rc=0, nothing on stderr.
#   (2) INPUT THE PARSER REJECTED made the goal FAIL silently. pl_parse_term_text() returned 0 and the leaf
#       returned a bare failure, so `foo bar baz.` neither bound nor raised.
#
# ⛔⭐ THIS IS THE FAILURE SHAPE THAT OUTRANKS BIGGER BOARD MOVERS. A missing error that FAILS stops a program; a
# missing error that returns a PLAUSIBLE WRONG ANSWER lets it continue and corrupt what it touches. It is also the
# one class our own suites structurally cannot catch: a wrong term diffs GREEN against a ref cut from the same
# wrong behaviour. Every witness here is therefore ORACLE-CUT, never self-pinned.
#
# ⛔⭐ EVERY WITNESS IS GRADED THROUGH catch/3, NEVER OFF STDERR. rt_pl_iso_throw_* prints a stderr line that is
# byte-identical to the real uncaught-ball reporter (FINDING-2026-09-06-hq_R), so a stderr-graded witness reads
# GREEN over this exact defect. The gate reads @OK/@ER markers the program itself writes, and grades rc beside them.
#
# ⛔ THE NO-RAISE POPULATION IS THE CONTROL AND IT IS THE POINT. Over-raising is the natural failure mode of a
# reader-validation cure -- a reader that rejects everything passes a raise-only gate perfectly. The controls
# caught a real one during development: `0'a.` (a character-code constant, ISO § 6.4.4) was read as an opening
# quote, so the term ran to EOF and the new end-token test called a well-formed term a syntax error.
#
# ⛔ CULPRIT DETAIL IS DELIBERATELY NOT GRADED. swipl says syntax_error(end_of_file) where gprolog says
# syntax_error(', or ) expected'); ISO leaves the culprit loose. Both oracles agree on the CLASS and the
# CATCHABILITY for every witness below, and that agreement is the whole gradeable invariant.
#
# ⛔ RESIDUE CURED 2026-09-06 (seat09/hq_C, row prolog-frontend-accepts-malformed-terms-and-reports-no-error-so-
# read2-cannot-raise-syntax-error). The frontend used to silently accept five malformed inputs: pt_primary's
# default case swallowed an unexpected token with no diagnostic (and since pt_primary always consumes a token
# before dispatching, the evidence was gone before anyone could complain), and several "consume the closing
# delimiter if it's there" call sites had no else-branch for when it wasn't. Both are cured in prolog_parse.c;
# the five now raise like any other malformed input and are graded as ordinary E rows in the W table below,
# beside the controls that prove the cure did not over-raise (a bare comma is now always a syntax error, but
# ';' unquoted, '-' as an atom, and character-code literals are untouched).
# ⛔ atom_to_term/3 and term_to_atom/2 reach the same validator and therefore no longer return a wrong term, but
# they FAIL where swipl RAISES -- they are not ISO 8.14 read builtins and are not wired to a ball, so they are NOT
# graded here. Naming them: a silent failure is a strict improvement on a silent wrong answer and is still wrong.
