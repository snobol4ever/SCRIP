# util_gate_preflight.sh -- THE PRE-LANDING PREFLIGHT FOR ONE GATE FILE (ceo CEO-432 item 3, ordered again in
# CEO-441 item 7 as hq_T's first instrument).  Run it on the gate you are about to push.
#
#     bash scripts/util_gate_preflight.sh test_gate_sno_dump_matches_spitbol.sh
#     bash scripts/util_gate_preflight.sh --all          # the same checks over every gate on disk
#
# ⛔ WHY A PER-FILE TOOL WHEN TWO FLEET-WIDE CENSUSES ALREADY EXIST.  They do, and they work -- ARM 15 of
# test_gate_runners_refuse_on_a_stale_binary.sh names any scrip-executing gate with no freshness guard, and
# util_gate_wiring.py names any gate that landed in no recipe.  Both of them fire INSIDE `make test`, which
# means they fire in EVERYBODY ELSE'S sitting, about a file one seat pushed.  That is the wrong moment and the
# wrong person: hq_S measured it when test_gate_sno_fence_body_dynamic_operand.sh landed unwired and the gate
# that could have graded its cure was run by nothing for a day, and the ceo measured it again the night
# test_gate_define_alternate_entry.sh landed unwired AND with the S4E_HOME root defect -- reds that arrived in
# other seats' `make test`, hours after the author had moved on.  ⭐ THE POINT IS NOT A NEW CHECK.  It is the
# SAME checks, addressable by one file name, cheap enough to run before the push, so the debt is paid by the
# seat that created it while the file is still in front of them.
#
# ⛔⭐ AND IT DELEGATES EVERY CHECK IT CAN, WHICH IS THE ONLY WAY THIS FILE IS ALLOWED TO EXIST.  The freshness
# population rule is gate_file_executes_scrip/gate_file_has_fresh_guard in lib_gate.sh -- EXTRACTED from ARM 15
# and now called by both, so the census and the preflight cannot disagree about the same file.  The wiring
# question is `util_gate_wiring.py reach`, the one authority on what `make test` actually runs.  This lane has
# measured the cost of copy number two more than once (gate_require_fresh vs assert_binary_current: cured in
# one, regenerated in the other, cured a SECOND time nine days later); a preflight that re-spelled either rule
# would tell the seat "clean" while the census that gates the fleet says "uncovered", and the seat would
# believe the instrument that ran first.
#
# THE SEVEN CHECKS, and what each one has actually caught:
#   1 EXISTS + is a readable regular file                        -- refuses rc=2, never a verdict on nothing.
#   2 SHEBANG                                                    -- shape only; the recipe says `bash <file>`.
#   3 FRESHNESS: executes ./scrip => carries the guard           -- ARM 15's rule, asked one file at a time.
#   4 ROOT NOT RESOLVED FROM BARE $S4E_HOME                      -- the cfo's 2026-09-09 class: S4E_HOME is the
#     SEAT root (/home/claude_T), not the checkout (/home/claude_T/SCRIP), so a gate that reads it as the
#     checkout finds every path MISSING for any seat that exports it -- and PASSES inside `make test`, where
#     S4E_HOME is unset.  ⭐ THE DANGEROUS HALF IS THAT IT IS GREEN WHERE IT IS TESTED: the author runs
#     `make test`, sees green, and the gate is red for every DONE-WHEN in the fleet, which all export S4E_HOME.
#   5 WIRING                                                     -- reachable from a recipe, or declared out
#     with a reason in gate_wiring.tsv; landed-unwired-and-undeclared is the defect.
#   6 A REFUSAL PATH (rc=2)                                      -- "I could not measure" must be sayable.
#   7 A PRINTED DENOMINATOR                                      -- a green that examined nothing is the
#     original sin of this whole family (31 of 105 gates could not say no, seat16's audit).
#
# EXIT: 0 every check clean · 1 at least one check RED · 2 REFUSED (the file is not there, or an authority
# this tool delegates to is missing).  ⛔ NEVER 0 on a file it could not read: that is the shape it grades for.
