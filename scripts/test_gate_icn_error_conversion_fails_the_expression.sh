#!/bin/bash
# When &error is set, Icon converts a run-time error into a FAILURE of the offending expression: the
# error is recorded in &errornumber/&errortext and evaluation CONTINUES. SCRIP records the error and
# then carries on as if nothing had failed, which is two very different symptoms with one root. Row
# icon-error-conversion-records-the-error-but-does-not-fail-the-expression.
#
# ⛔ ONE OF THE TWO SYMPTOMS IS A HANG, WHICH IS WHY THIS GATE TIMES OUT AND CALLS IT RED rather than
# leaving the runner to hang: `&error := 1; every write(1 to 5 by 0)` prints 1 forever at ~100% CPU
# (seat05 confirmed it twice, once live via ps) because core_icn_by_zero_check absorbs error 211 and
# returns, so the generator restarts from its first value instead of failing. iconx prints nothing and
# reaches the next statement with &errornumber = 211. The second symptom is silent in the other
# direction: `runerr(500)` under &error aborts the program, where iconx converts it to a failure --
# by_name_dispatch's runerr arm prints and exits(1) without ever consulting the &error state.
#
# ⭐ THE UNTRAPPED ARMS ARE CONTROL ARMS AND THEY ARE THE POINT: with &error unset, `by 0` and
# `runerr` must STILL abort with their error. A cure that makes them fail unconditionally would turn
# every uncaught Icon run-time error into a silent failure -- far worse than the defect -- and those
# two arms are what catch it.
# ⛔ REFUSES rc=2 unless all 10 runs (5 witnesses x 2 modes) are graded, and rc=2 if the oracle is
# missing. Expectations come from a LIVE iconx run, never hardcoded.
