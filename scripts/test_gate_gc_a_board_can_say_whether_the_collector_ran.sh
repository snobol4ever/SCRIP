# test_gate_gc_a_board_can_say_whether_the_collector_ran.sh -- ARENA_MB STATES A CONFIGURATION; THIS MEASURES THE EXERCISE.
#
# ⛔⭐ THE GAP THIS CLOSES (cfo 2026-09-21, MODE TENET, GC commitment items 1-2 INSTRUMENTED and VISIBILITY).  Lon's rule
# is that ALL GC testing runs at a tiny arena to exasperate the collector (2026-09-19 16:1x, CEO-931/934/938, RULES.md
# § THE INSTRUMENT LAWS BATCH 28 CLAUSE 2), and the fleet holds it by mechanism: the Makefile exports SCRIP_HEAP_MB ?= 1,
# the harness prints an ARENA line and an arena_mb= board field, and a gate polices the pins.  ⛔ EVERY ONE OF THOSE
# REPORTS THE CONFIGURATION AND NONE OF THEM REPORTS THE EXERCISE.  A board that prints arena_mb=1 is saying what it
# ASKED FOR, not what happened, and a tiny-arena green can come from programs the collector never ran on even once.
# MEASURED HERE, which is why this is a gate and not an opinion: hb_file_name_unrooted.icn collects ONCE at 1 MB and
# ZERO TIMES at 4 MB -- identical to the shipped 512 -- so a seat who picked 4 MB believing it "small" measured nothing
# and every instrument in the tree would have agreed with them.
#
# ⛔⛔ AND THE ARENA FIELD IN THE RUNTIME'S OWN AT-EXIT LINE WAS REPORTING A CONSTANT.  Before SCRIP <this landing>,
# rt_gcheap_report printed `arena=%dMB` from (int)GC_HEAP_MB -- a COMPILE-TIME #define of 512 -- while the window that
# actually ran is a LOCAL in rt_gcheap_init.  Measured both ways on one binary through the env switch: at SCRIP_HEAP_MB=1
# (which collected) and at 512 (which did not), the [ZHP] line read `arena=512MB` BOTH TIMES.  Under a fleet-wide law
# that every seat run at 1 MB, the one runtime line naming the arena named the wrong one, always.
#
# ⭐ WHAT THE RECEIPT IS.  SCRIP_GC_EXERCISE=1 makes rt_gcheap_report emit ONE line per program at exit --
#   [GC-EXERCISE] arena_mb= reserve_mb= stress= collections= blocks= bytes=
# -- built from the RESOLVED window (g_hp_chunk), the RESOLVED reserve, and rt_gc_runs_count(), all of which already
# existed and none of which anything read.  ONE LINE PER PROGRAM, NOT PER COLLECTION, on purpose: SCRIP_ZETA_TELEM
# already prints a [ZGC] line per regeneration, and a board cannot afford 1613 lines per entry to learn one number.
#
# ⛔ THE FAIL-ONCE IS BUILT IN RATHER THAN PLANTED, which is the discipline that matters here: a do-nothing instrument
# -- the code as it stood this morning -- passes any single-arena arm.  Arms 2 and 3 read the SAME field at THREE
# arenas and require it to TRACK, so a hardcoded 512 (the actual pre-cure behaviour, measured above) reds arm 2 and an
# absent or constant collections= reds arm 3.  FAIL_ONCE=1 additionally asserts the pre-cure expectation and must red.
