# test_gate_pas_a_for_statement_evaluates_its_initial_and_final_values_once_before_the_loop.sh -- the initial value and the final value of a for-statement are evaluated ONCE, in that order, before the control variable is first assigned (ISO 7185 6.8.3.9).
#
# MEASURED 2026-10-09 by hq_pascal against fpc -Miso: `lim := 4; n := 0; for i := 1 to lim do begin n := n + 1; lim := 1 end` ran the body once where fpc runs it four times, in both modes: the lowerer placed the final-value expression in the loop test and so
# evaluated it again on every iteration (`for i := 1 to f do` with a function f called f five times, `for c := 'a' to chr(ord('a') + lim)` and `for i := 5 downto lim + 1` stopped as soon as the body changed lim). Found running Pascal-P5's compiler under scrip: pcom
# writes a string constant with `for k := 1 to lenpv(p) do ... p := p^.next`, lenpv shrank as p advanced, and `lca 12 'Hello, world'` came out as `lca 12 'Hello, wor'`, so P5's interpreter printed `Hello, wor` and two blanks for P5's own hello sample.
# CURE (pascal.y only; no new global): the two for rules build, for a final value that is not a literal, a hidden per-routine local __pas_flN (pas_local_add: a frame slot, so a recursive routine's activations do not share it), assign the final value to it before
# the loop and give the for-statement that local as its limit; when the initial value is not a literal either, it is captured into its own local first so the order stays initial value, then final value, as fpc does. A literal limit is left as it was.
#
# ARMS, both modes: two controls cut LIVE from fpc -Miso that must be byte-identical: the limit read, a function called as the limit (the number of calls is printed), a limit that is an expression, a char loop, a downto loop with a variable limit, a body that changes the
# limit, an initial value and a final value that are both function calls (the order is printed), and a recursive routine whose for-loop calls itself. FAIL_ONCE=1 corrupts the first control's ref.
