#
# ⛔⭐ THE DEFECT: the ceo's umbrella template grepped the runner's WHOLE stdout for PASS=[1-9] to prove it measured, then for
# (FAIL|REJECT|CRASH|HANG|...)=[1-9] to red it. That assumes EVERY score-shaped token in the stream belongs to the score. False since
# CEO-251 REQUIRED informational arms beside it: snoflake prints an sbl-vs-@expect line and csnobol4 a triangulation line, both
# carrying FAIL= BY DESIGN, so those rows read unfinished against a PERFECT SCRIP. And false in the other direction where a runner
# spells its count lowercase -- dotnet's clean suite read "printed no PASS count" and refused.
# ⭐ BOTH FAILURES ARE THE SAME BUG WEARING OPPOSITE MASKS: a false red and a false refusal out of one wrong assumption, which is why
# curing only the arm that bit you leaves the class alive. EXTRACTION ANCHORS ON IDENTITY, NEVER ON POSITION -- name the line
# (^GIMPEL_BOARD, ^SUITE_BOARD, ^mode-3), pull the tokens out of THAT line, and spell them the way the runner prints them.
#
# WHAT IS GRADED RED: a DONE-WHEN that pipes the variable holding the runner's WHOLE captured output into a grep for a score token.
# WHAT IS ACCEPTED: the same grep applied to a variable that was itself extracted with a labelled/anchored pattern.
# ⛔ SCOPED EXACTLY TO THE RULING AND NO WIDER. A whole-stdout grep for something that is NOT a score token (inria greps its own
# stdout for 445/445) is the same FAMILY of defect and is reported as a NAMED OBSERVATION, never counted in the red -- the ruling
# covers score-token greps, and a gate broader than its rule gets switched off by the first person it blocks for a good reason.
# ⛔ IT DOES NOT RUN ANY SUITE. It reads baton text only: hermetic, sub-second, no build, no oracle.
# Population: tasks/*-to-100-percent*.task.md and *-censused-by-class*.task.md. Denominator printed; REFUSES rc=2 on an empty one.
# UMBRELLA_TASKS_DIR overrides the live postoffice, which is how the fail-once arms run on scratch batons and never on real ones.
# Usage: bash scripts/test_gate_umbrella_done_whens_anchor_on_the_board_line.sh    Exit: 0 all anchored · 1 some unanchored · 2 cannot measure.
