#
# WHAT IT GUARDS. a4bbdb554 ("the meta-call bridge now reaches BUILTINS, seeded from the tree's own table")
# synthesises name(A..) :- name(A..) for every entry of pl_det_leaves[] plus a five-name early table and
# registers each through pl_bb_register/pl_new_proc. Bisected on adjacent commits with one variable, that
# registration turned TWO ladder witnesses m4-red while leaving m3 correct:
#     ladder__rung06_declarations_dynamic            m3=PASS m4=FAIL(rc=0)  -- :- dynamic(foo/1) does not take
#                                                                              effect in m4; the call raises
#                                                                              existence_error(procedure,foo/1)
#     ladder__rung16_termio_current_char_conversion  m3=PASS m4=FAIL(rc=1)  -- ERROR 022 Undefined function called
# Green at a4bbdb554^ (001f904e2) in both modes; red at a4bbdb554; still red at 3377cf43e.
#
# ⛔ IT IS NOT NAME SHADOWING, and this gate exists so nobody re-derives that. None of dynamic/1,
# char_conversion/2, current_char_conversion/2 is in pl_det_leaves[] or in the early table -- all three are
# special-cased ABOVE the leaf lookup in goal(). No wrapper stands in front of them; the damage comes from the
# bulk registration itself, on the compiled side only.
#
# ⭐ THE GRADING IS NOT REIMPLEMENTED HERE. It defers to test_prolog_ladder.sh, which owns the population, the
# refs and the m4 recipe, and greps that runner's own verdict lines. A criterion that re-cut its own refs could
# drift away from the ladder it claims to protect; this one cannot.
#
# ⭐ THE m3 ARM IS A CONTROL, NOT A SECOND CHECK. Both witnesses pass in m3 today and the defect is m4-only. If
# m3 goes red the baseline itself is broken, and this gate REFUSES rc=2 rather than reporting an m4 defect it can
# no longer attribute -- a red here must mean "the m4 regression is present", never "something upstream died".
#
# EXIT: 0 both witnesses m4=PASS · 1 either m4-red (the regression is live) · 2 REFUSED (cannot measure).
