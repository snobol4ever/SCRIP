# test_gate_scrip_sizes_the_heap_with_d_and_i.sh -- SCRIP SIZES THE GC HEAP WITH -d (THE HARD CAP) AND -i (THE INITIAL WINDOW AND
# ENLARGE AMOUNT) AND THE STACK WITH -s, AS SPITBOL DOES, IN BOTH MODES; THE ENVIRONMENT KNOBS ARE A NAMED TEST SEAM THAT A SWITCH
# OVERRIDES (cto 2026-09-23, row spine-scrip-sizes-the-heap-with-d-and-i-and-the-stack-with-s-exactly-like-spitbol; Lon in-chat
# to the ceo, verbatim: "Do we set the stack and heap memory with the -s and the -m command line switches, just like SPITBOL. If
# not, do you not think we should?"; CEO-1225).
#
# WHY A SWITCH AND NOT AN ENV KNOB: an environment variable is invisible in a transcript -- it is how the 1 MB tiny arm read as a
# measurement while inert (CEO-1146) -- and a switch on the command line is recorded with the run.
#
# ARMS (every reading comes from the runtime's own GC-EXERCISE report, collections= and cap_kb=, never from the knob):
#   (1) a witness whose live set is above the 4 MB default cap dies there, and prints its answer under -d64m, in mode 3;
#   (2) the same witness compiled once and run as a binary takes -d64m on ITS command line and prints the answer (mode 4);
#   (3) -i is the window: the same allocating witness collects many times at -i128k and never at -i64m, both under -d64m;
#   (4) the switch wins over the seam: SCRIP_HEAP_KB=128 in the environment with -i64m on the line reads zero collections;
#   (5) the seam still works alone (the 92 instrument scripts that size through SCRIP_HEAP_KB are not broken by this landing);
#   (6) -s raises the stack: a deep-recursion witness that overflows the runtime's 64 MB floor completes at -s512m, both modes
#       (the limit is only ever raised -- neither the driver nor the runtime shrinks the inherited rlimit -- so the arm measures the raise);
#   (7) the usage no longer calls -d/-i accepted-and-ignored;
#   (8) NEGATIVE: -d below -i is refused with its reason; a malformed -d value is refused; the -i arm can red (a wrong expectation).
#
# Usage: bash scripts/test_gate_scrip_sizes_the_heap_with_d_and_i.sh    (exit 0 = green, 1 = measured broken, 2 = could not measure)
