# scripts/test_gate_raku_parse_census_measures_over_a_printed_denominator.sh -- THE GATE ON THE PARSE-COVERAGE
# INSTRUMENT (hq_raku 2026-09-16, cto's ask RE parse-coverage-taken-as-68-of-1464-and-the-census-must-be-a-script-on-origin).
#
# ⛔⭐ WHAT IT GRADES AND WHY AN INSTRUMENT NEEDS A GATE AT ALL. util_raku_parse_census.sh exists because a
# figure produced by hand can be produced wrongly by hand again. That argument only holds if the SCRIPT
# cannot go wrong quietly -- a census that silently counted 0, or counted the whole tree, or printed a
# numerator with no denominator beside it, would be the same defect wearing an instrument's clothes and
# would be BELIEVED, because it arrives as output rather than as an opinion.
# ⛔ IT RUNS AGAINST A SYNTHETIC TREE OF KNOWN ANSWER, NEVER AGAINST ROAST: a gate whose expected value is
# whatever the real corpus currently reads is a ratchet, not a gate -- it would go green on any number and
# would have to be edited every time the compiler improved. Here the answer is known by construction (one
# file that parses, one that cannot), so the gate grades the INSTRUMENT and never the coverage.
# ⛔ OFFLINE, sub-second, writes nothing outside its own temp dir.

# finding the gate unmoved). The name still appeared -- in the eight-line comment block explaining the call.
# ⭐ THE GENERAL FORM, and it is this file's own subject recurring one level up: an instrument that answers
# a NARROWER question than you think you asked never says so. "Is this string in the file" is not "does this
# file call that script", and the difference is invisible for exactly as long as the two answers agree.

# published row from a diagnostic. The trailing-end anchor is what makes this arm about stdout.
# ⛔ THESE THREE ARMS ARE STATIC ON PURPOSE AND SAY SO: running the board end-to-end would be the stronger
# check, and it is refused here because even `--run --limit 2` calls progress_append per file -- a gate that
# writes rows into the progress database to prove a board prints a line has bought its evidence with a side
