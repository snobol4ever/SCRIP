# util_ipl_grade_programs.sh -- grade one or more corpus/packages/icon/ipl/progs/<name>.icn programs in BOTH
# modes against their own .std, using test_icon_ipl_suite.sh's EXACT semantics, and exit 0 only if every
# named program passes both. hq_I 2026-09-06.
#
# WHY IT EXISTS. A baton's DONE-WHEN has to be a runnable command, and three rows of one entangled cure were
# about to carry three near-identical 900-character one-liners inlined into their batons. That is the
# copy-paste this repo forbids everywhere else (lib_oracle_flags.sh, lib_gate.sh, lib_ladder.sh, the one
# encoder): a criterion re-derived per caller drifts per caller, and a DONE-WHEN that drifts is worse than
# one that is missing, because it still prints a verdict.
#
# ⛔ IT MUST AGREE WITH THE SUITE OR IT IS MEASURING SOMETHING ELSE. Four conventions are the suite's, not
# this file's, and every one of them was a live defect for somebody before it was a convention:
#   · ipl_isolation_run for cwd/ICONPATH isolation -- IPL ships programs that RENAME EVERY FILE IN CWD.
#   · NAME.dat as stdin when present, /dev/null otherwise -- never guessed.
#   · NAME.argv through ipl_argv_read -- and ONLY rc=2 is "malformed"; a program with no sidecar at all
#     returns non-zero too, so `ipl_argv_read ... || refuse` REFUSES ON EVERY ARGV-LESS PROGRAM. Measured
#     here: igrep (no .argv) refused before this was matched to the suite's own `argv_rc -eq 2` test.
#     Passed after `--` in m3 and bare in m4 (the suite's own note explains
#     why the clever ${ARR[@]+-- "${ARR[@]}"} form GLUES the literal to the first element and is wrong).
#   · NAME.fixtures via IPL_ISO_FIXTURES.
# ⛔ AND ICONPATH IS EXPORTED FOR THE COMPILE STEP TOO. The suite exports it globally (its line 94) because
# m4's `--compile` runs UNISOLATED, so a program that `link`s a procs/ file cannot resolve it otherwise.
# Measured while writing this: igrep graded m3=PASS m4=FAIL from a harness that set ICONPATH only for the
# run -- a pure instrument bug that reads exactly like a mode divergence in the compiler.
#
# Usage: bash scripts/util_ipl_grade_programs.sh igrep roffcmds
# Exits 0 all-pass, 1 any-fail, 2 cannot measure. Prints one line per program.
