# lib_pristine_lock.sh -- row `build-governor-holds-pristine-while-box-idles`. Bounded-wait wrapper
# around the per-root pristine BUILD_LOCK (make-pristine-per-root-flock-second-builder-waits). Replaces
# the Makefile's old `flock $(BUILD_LOCK) -c '...'`'s UNBOUNDED, SILENT blocking wait with a bounded one
# that REFUSES LOUDLY -- naming the current holder -- instead of hanging. hq_P lost ~9.5h overnight
# (22:05->07:41) to exactly this shape: a hold that is, from the waiting seat's side, indistinguishable
# from a slow build. REPRODUCED under CONTROL before this cure existed: an artificial holder that does
# nothing but `sleep` (0.0% CPU for its whole 30s hold, confirmed via `ps`) blocked `make pristine` just
# as completely as a real compile would -- the old mechanism cannot tell a HELD build from a SLOW one
# because it has no concept of "wait, but not forever" and prints nothing while waiting.
#
# ⛔ THE MUTUAL EXCLUSION ITSELF IS UNCHANGED -- this does not touch why the lock exists (two `make
# pristine` in one root racing the same `rm -rf`, see make-pristine-per-root-flock-second-builder-waits).
# A normal, healthy build still acquires near-instantly and behaves byte-identically to before. The ONLY
# behavior change is what happens after waiting past the bound for the SAME lock: silently-wait-forever
# becomes bounded-wait-then-loud-refusal, matching this codebase's own refuse-not-repair idiom used
# elsewhere (lib_build_governor.sh's _governor_preflight, util_verify_s_artifacts_owed.sh).
#
# WHY A SEPARATE SCRIPT, NOT INLINED INTO THE MAKEFILE RECIPE: the Makefile recipe shell is not
# guaranteed to be bash (POSIX $(SHELL), often dash), and this needs bash's `{fd}<>` automatic fd
# allocation to hold the lock open across a probe-then-wait sequence without racing itself. Invoked
# directly via `bash scripts/lib_pristine_lock.sh ...` from the recipe, sidestepping the question.
#
# USAGE: bash scripts/lib_pristine_lock.sh <lockfile> -- <command...>
# EXIT CODE CONTRACT (mirrors lib_build_governor.sh's shape so the two are read the same way):
#   98  couldn't even open the lockfile (bad path/permissions) -- the wrapped command NEVER RAN.
#   99  wait exceeded S4E_PRISTINE_LOCK_TIMEOUT (default 1200s, override for a legitimately slower box)
#       -- the wrapped command NEVER RAN. stderr names the current holder's PID + cmdline first.
#   64  usage error (no command given to wrap).
#   *   any other code is the WRAPPED COMMAND's own exit status, passed through verbatim.
# 1200s (20min) is chosen well above any observed real -O0 pristine build (~1m40 quiet-box, single
# digit minutes even under heavy fleet contention per seat04's 748s FULL-CORPUS-BOARD measurement,
# which is a much heavier operation than one pristine) and far below "hours" -- generous enough to
# never trip a legitimately-slow-but-live build, bounded enough to turn a multi-hour silent hang into
# an actionable refusal within one sitting.
