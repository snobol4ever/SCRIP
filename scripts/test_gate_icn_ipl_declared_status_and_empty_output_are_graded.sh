# test_gate_icn_ipl_declared_status_and_empty_output_are_graded.sh -- A PROGRAM WHOSE CORRECT EXIT STATUS IS NOT 0, OR WHOSE CORRECT
# OUTPUT IS EMPTY, IS GRADED ON IT (hq_icon 2026-09-27; Lon's word "Get IPL to 843."; ceo CEO-1315). IPL's ttt, hr and krieg end
# every run in stop() (status 1); progs/proto exits before it prints. The status is declared in the pre-existing NAME.rc (seat07's
# sidecar, which the cutter already mints under) and test_icon_ipl_suite.sh now grades it in both modes; an empty output by design
# is declared in NAME.empty, with its reason, and the cutter then mints the empty ref instead of refusing it as EMPTY.
# ARMS: (a) GREEN a planted stop() unit with NAME.rc = 1 mints and matches in m3 and m4 with status 1 checked; (b) the runner
# grades NAME.rc in its m3 and m4 verdicts (read off test_icon_ipl_suite.sh) and a copy without that check reads RED; (c) GREEN a
# planted unit that exits before printing, with NAME.empty, mints a 0-byte ref that m3 and m4 match; (d) RED a cutter copy
# whose EMPTY arm ignores NAME.empty (the origin behaviour) refuses it; (e) RED a declared status that is WRONG (a comment line, then 0,
# for a unit that exits 1) is refused by the cutter -- before ipl_rc_declared the cutter read the file with a bare cat, compared the
# integer to a two-line string, the test errored, and the unit minted with its status never compared (the coo's review of 569bf02c6);
# (f) RED a malformed NAME.rc ("1 2") is refused as RC_SIDECAR_MALFORMED, never compared as a string or skipped.
