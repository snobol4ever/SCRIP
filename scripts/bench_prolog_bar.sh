# FACT RULE, CEO-1242) against a bar, read from angle 1 of the Prolog three-angle harness (test_bench_prolog_timed.sh: a live doubling
# search for the largest N whose between+fail loop completes within BAR_BUD_MS (500); the multiple is read on the SELF-MEASURED WORK per
# iteration inside the generated bracket, the two-number basis (CEO-1281 -- the CPU rate carried mode 3's in-process compile); the kernel's
# single-shot output is held to its .ref on every engine, under its declared -d/-s sidecars, before it is timed) for the one kernel, in ONE
# run -- no board, no row written.
#   kernel K BAR [swi|gnu]   K is the kernel's file stem (tak, deriv, nreverse, ...); the rival is swipl (default) or gprolog
#                            (gprolog --consult-file). A kernel whose arm reads SKIP, CRASH or no rate REFUSES: no multiple over an
#                            uncited reading. BAR_MODE=m3 grades mode 3 instead of mode 4.
# EXIT 0 at or above the bar (GREEN), 1 below it (RED, the row is open), 2 REFUSED (no binary, no rival, no citable reading).
