# bench_raku_bar.sh -- THE RAKU SPEED ROW'S CRITERION (ceo CEO-1283, 2026-09-26; the Raku twin of bench_prolog_bar.sh): ONE kernel under
# corpus/benchmarks/raku, the bare multiple Rakudo time / SCRIP mode-4 time (RULES.md FACT RULE, CEO-1242) against a bar, read from the three-angle
# harness bench_triangulate_raku.sh (angle 3's self-measured WORK inside the kernel's bracket, best of REPS, the two timed angles' cross-proof
# required to AGREE on both arms; every rep byte-verified against the .ref; the kernel under its declared -d/-s sidecars) for the one kernel, in
# ONE run -- no board, no row written. The bar is the reference implementation, Rakudo: Raku has no native compiler on the box (RULES.md x-factor
# rule, THE REFERENCE IS THE COMPILER).
#   kernel K BAR       K is the kernel's file stem (string-escape, point_class_add, ...). A kernel whose arm is UNVERIFIED, whose cross-proof
#                      reads DISAGREE or UNPROVEN on either arm, or that carries no bracket, REFUSES: no multiple over an uncited reading.
#                      BAR_MODE=m3 grades mode 3 instead of mode 4.
# EXIT 0 at or above the bar (GREEN), 1 below it (RED, the row is open), 2 REFUSED (no binary, no rakudo, no citable reading).
