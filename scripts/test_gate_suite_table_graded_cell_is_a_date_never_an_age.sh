# the test was run which produced the results which are being reported.").
# ⛔ THE DEFECT: .github/scripts/util_suite_banner.py md() wrote '<date> (today|yesterday|N days ago)', and --set re-renders only the
# row a run measured, so every other row kept the age it was written with: on 2026-09-23 all 26 cells of SCORE.md read '(today)', among
# them Dotnet, TPgm and Roast graded 2026-09-16. A date cannot go stale; an age written into a file can.
# ARMS (hermetic -- a scratch SUITES.tsv and SCORE.md; only arm 3 reads the real SCORE.md, and it writes nothing):
#   1 rows graded today, yesterday and seven days ago each render their graded cell as exactly '| <date> |'
#   2 no rendered line carries '(today)', '(yesterday)' or '(N days ago)'
#   3 the committed .github/SCORE.md suite table carries no such age either
