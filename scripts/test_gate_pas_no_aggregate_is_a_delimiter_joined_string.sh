# test_gate_pas_no_aggregate_is_a_delimiter_joined_string.sh -- no Pascal record, array or char array is stored or processed as a string
# joined by a separator byte (\x01 SOH, \x05, \001): every site in Pascal's own code that builds, splits, splices or decodes one is counted
# and printed, and the gate is GREEN only at zero.
# Lon 2026-09-28, in-chat to hq_pascal, verbatim: "Do not store records like that." then "Get rid of ALL delimited based processing like the
# one I just discovered." (after "What are seperator bytes? Are you storing data as tag delimited strings? Where are you doing that crazy thing?")
#
# POPULATION, declared rather than globbed: src/runtime/by_name_dispatch.c -- the builtins named __pas_*, arr_get and arr_set_pure (emitted
# by the Pascal lowerer alone: grep -rlw '"arr_get"' src/lower) and the C functions named pas_*; src/parsers/pascal/pascal.y; and
# src/lower/lower_common.c's norm_charseq (the shared string relop decoding Pascal's SOH-coded char arrays -- it serves no other encoding).
# A site is a line carrying SOH, '\x01', "\x01", '\x05' or \001 inside one of those bodies. Raku's delimited arrays and hashes (__rk_*,
# hash_*, push_pure, arr_init/last/tail ...) are hq_raku's and are NOT counted here.
# READ-ONLY, no build. rc 0 = zero sites; rc 1 = sites remain (each printed file:line [owner]); rc 2 = cannot measure.
