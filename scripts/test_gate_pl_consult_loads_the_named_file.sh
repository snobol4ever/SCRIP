#
# THE DEFECT THIS PINS, in two shapes with very different failure modes:
#   consult(t_foo)  raised existence_error(procedure,consult/1) -- loud, and at least honest.
#   :- [t_foo].     parsed, ran, exited 0, and DEFINED NOTHING. Silently accepted as a no-op. ⭐ That is the
#                   worse of the two by a distance: a no-op LOOKS ALIVE, and the program only dies later at the
#                   first call to a predicate the file was supposed to define, pointing at the wrong place.
# THE CURE: SCRIP compiles ahead of time, so consult means what an extra positional source file means -- the
# named file's clauses join THIS program at compile time. Multi-file loading therefore rides the same path
# test_gate_pl_multifile_initialization_runs_every_file already pins, instead of becoming a second unproven way
# to build a program. A runtime consult would need a runtime compiler; that is a different rung.
#
# WHAT IT PROVES, in six directions so a careless cure cannot pass it:
#   (a) consult/1 makes the named file's predicates callable, both modes.
#   (b) the BRACKET form is a REAL synonym, not a no-op -- the shape that used to lie.
#   (c) consult INSIDE A DIRECTIVE CONJUNCTION works (`:- consult(F), Goal.`) -- NOT the same code path as a
#       directive whose whole subject is the consult.
#   (h) ⛔ AND THE LIMIT IS PINNED, NOT HIDDEN: `F = t_foo, [F]` -- a VARIABLE file name -- cannot be resolved
#       at compile time, so it must RAISE consult/1 rather than silently succeed. THIS IS THE INRIA DRIVER'S
#       ACTUAL SPELLING (inriasuite.pl:623-624, `test(F,[G,ProgFile,Expected]) :- [ProgFile],`), which means
#       this row does NOT win that INRIA point: that needs runtime loading, i.e. a runtime compiler, a
#       different rung. The arm exists so nobody reads this cure as covering it.
#   (d) ⛔ CONTROL, AND THE ONE THAT KEEPS THE CURE HONEST: a list in a DATA position is NOT a consult.
#       `X = [a,b]` must still bind a list. A cure that scans every term for a list of atoms passes (a)-(c)
#       and silently tries to load files named a and b.
#   (e) CONTROL: a MISSING consulted file names itself on stderr and the program stays ALIVE, matching swipl,
#       which warns and continues. Neither a silent no-op nor a dead process.
#   (f) CONTROL: consulting the same file twice defines its predicates ONCE, not twice.
#   (g) The oracle is ASSERTED, never assumed: swipl runs every witness and the gate REFUSES if its answer moved.
# ⛔ Hermetic: every program is written under mktemp; nothing in corpus/ is read or written.
