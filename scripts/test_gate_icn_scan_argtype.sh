# test_gate_icn_scan_argtype.sh -- THE INVARIANT GATE for the Icon builtin argument-type class on the
# SCAN-NODE route: inside a scanning expression, `any many upto bal find match tab move` must RAISE the
# oracle's own error and abort on a wrong-type argument, and must CONVERT-AND-SUCCEED on a right-type-
# convertible one.  Row `icon-scan-node-builtins-do-not-refuse-wrong-argument-types` (hq_B 2026-09-04);
# cure and sizing in FINDING-2026-09-04-hq_B-icon-scan-node-builtins-now-refuse-wrong-argument-types-
# and-the-class-is-closed-on-both-routes.md.
#
# ⛔⭐ WHY THIS EXISTS BESIDE test_icon_ladder.sh, WHICH ALREADY RUNS THESE WITNESSES.  The ladder grades
# stdout against a CHECKED-IN .ref.  A .ref is a photograph of what SCRIP printed on the day someone cut
# it, so a ladder green proves only "unchanged since then" -- it cannot distinguish a cured builtin from
# a .ref that was cut while the builtin was broken.  This gate re-cuts every verdict from the LIVE ORACLE
# (icont/iconx v9.5.25a) on each run, so it answers the question the row was actually opened about.  It
# is also NAMED BY BUILTIN: a regression prints `any m4 code=none want=104` instead of moving a 420-row
# ladder total by two, which is the difference between a diagnosis and a search.
#
# ⛔ IT COMPARES THE ERROR CODE, THE rc AND stdout -- NEVER THE WHOLE DIAGNOSTIC.  icont prints `File/Line`,
# `offending value:` and a `Traceback:` that SCRIP does not; that verbosity gap is a real but SEPARATE and
# much wider class, and folding it in here would make this gate red for a reason it does not own and
# cannot cure.  Measured while writing this gate: a naive full-stderr diff calls all 8 refusals DIFF while
# every one of them raises the correct code with the correct rc.  An instrument wider than its question
# is as wrong as one narrower than it -- the same defect the digest records for `command -v`, pointing the
# other way.
#
# ⛔ AND IT REFUSES RATHER THAN PRINTING A ZERO.  Population comes from the corpus by ORIGIN column, never
# a filename glob and never a hardcoded list of 11 that silently stops covering witnesses added later.  A
# missing oracle, a missing master, or an EMPTY census exits 2: a census that cannot see its population
# must never report success over it (`find corpus/crosscheck -name '*.sno'` printing nothing and exiting 0
# is the house example).
#
# EXIT: 0 every witness agrees with the oracle in both modes · 1 any disagreement · 2 REFUSED (cannot measure).
