# GATE: capture-oracle-refs feeds the stdin companion, and a RED summary never exits 0.
#
# Row capture-feed-stdin-and-red-exit (hq_B, 2026-08-30) -- the "one edge" ceo kept when the stdin
# freeze was lifted. Two invariants, and each one is a defect this project has already paid for:
#
#   (1) A stdin-bearing stem mints a ref from oracle-WITH-stdin, never from oracle-with-/dev/null.
#       The freeze existed because rung36_jcon_recogn ran unfed, all three arms agreed on EMPTY, and
#       a vacuous 1-byte oracle was minted that would have passed forever (withdrawn, corpus
#       705cd7ad1). Agreement is only evidence when the arms CAN disagree -- so this gate does not
#       merely check that a ref appeared; it checks the ref carries the stdin's own bytes, and it
#       runs the SAME stem with the companion removed as a negative control, which must refuse.
#
#   (2) Any RED in the summary exits non-zero. It printed a full RED table and exited 0 until
#       2026-08-30. "Could not measure" and "measured fine" sharing an exit code is format Law 3's
#       two-audiences shape, and it sat on the very tool that carries Law 4: a human reads the ⛔
#       lines, a script reads rc=0 and marches straight into `convert`.
#
#   (3) LAW 1 ROUND-TRIP: a captured stdin-bearing family must CONVERT with its input intact --
#       .in sidecar written, entry NOT laundered into an XFAIL -- and the converted suite must go
#       red when that sidecar is taken away. A sidecar nothing depends on is not carrying anything.
#
# ⛔ SELF-CONTAINED: every fixture is minted under a mktemp dir and deleted. This gate never reads,
# writes, or grades anything inside corpus/ -- so it cannot be the reason a corpus file changed.
