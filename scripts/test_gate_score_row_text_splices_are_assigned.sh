# test_gate_score_row_text_splices_are_assigned.sh -- STATIC GATE (hq_T, on coo's measurement 2026-09-08).
# ⛔⭐ THE DEFECT: a runner splices ${VAR:+ ... } into the --text it hands util_score_row.py, and never assigns
# VAR.  test_snobol4_gimpel_suite.sh did exactly that with INV_LINE -- it called inventory_line for its stdout and
# threw it away -- so the vendor text carried no PACKAGE_INVENTORY clause, the writer REFUSED rc=2 on EVERY run,
# and that row could only ever be set by hand.  Three seats hit it the same evening (hq_C, the cto, the coo).
# ⭐ WHY IT SURVIVED, and this is the reusable half: `${VAR:+...}` is SILENT ON AN UNSET VARIABLE BY DESIGN.  The
# one construct that would have named the missing piece is the construct that guarantees nothing is named -- it
# expands to the empty string and the line stays well-formed.  The refusal that DID fire named the missing CLAUSE,
# which is one level away from the missing ASSIGNMENT, and three readers stopped at the level they were shown.
# ⛔ IT ASSERTS A STATIC PROPERTY AND RUNS NOTHING: no build, no suite, no oracle.  A gate that had to run the
# suite to find this would cost twenty minutes to learn something `grep` can prove in under a second.
