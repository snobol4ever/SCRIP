# test_gate_sno_a_bare_fence_in_a_pattern_thunk_releases_the_cells_to_its_left.sh -- a bare FENCE inside a pattern thunk (a stored
# p = TAB(0) FENCE, *p, the run-time pattern 'ab' ? TAB(0) FENCE 0 builds) after a box that keeps a spine cell (TAB, RTAB, SPAN, BREAK,
# REM, BAL) commits it, so backtracking into the thunk fails the whole match cleanly, in both modes, statically and inside EVAL, as
# SPITBOL answers it -- no [ZGC-STALE] SIGSEGV.
#
# ⛔ THE DEFECT (row snobol4-tab-then-a-bare-fence-then-an-integer-in-a-pattern-touches-a-stale-gc-pointer; found by the ceo's one-minute
#   run of the SCRIPtix program, CEO-1441, batch 33: 'ab' ? (TAB(0)) FENCE 0). The integer forces a run-time concatenation, so TAB(0)
#   FENCE becomes the thunk PAT$0 matched through MATCH_DEFER. fence0_release_bytes found the fence only on a chain from a MATCH_BEGIN,
#   and a thunk has none, so the FENCE released nothing and TAB's 16-byte cell stayed on the spine at the thunk's gamma. Backtracking
#   into the thunk goes PAT$0_beta -> the abort-exit marker -> PAT$0_omega, which assumes no cell is left: it read the saved r12 and the
#   caller's continuation 16 bytes off (r12 = the header's constant 3) and the run touched a moved block.
# THE CURE (src/emitter/emit.cpp fence0_release_bytes): in a graph with no MATCH_BEGIN -- a pattern thunk -- the fence is looked for on
#   the forward chain from the graph's entry, so it releases the backtrack-only cells to its left as it does in a statement; the ZD plan
#   already subtracts that release (zout = zd + K - REL), so the thunk's gamma trampoline reads at the released depth.
#
# THE ARMS (expectations cut from sbl -bf AT RUN TIME):
#   1-2  m3 / m4 STATIC: the row's witness, stored and deferred X FENCE over TAB, RTAB, SPAN, BREAK, REM, a capture over it  -- RED on base
#   3-4  m3 / m4 EVAL: the same shapes and the ceo's ('ab' ? (TAB(0)) FENCE 0), EVALed                         -- RED on base
#   5-6  CONTROL m3 / m4: shapes base already answers -- LEN(1) FENCE (no cell), TAB(0) FENCE 'x' in a statement, the thunk
#        matched through with nothing after it
# EXIT: 0 all arms pass · 1 an arm failed · 2 REFUSED (no binary, no oracle, no tmpdir, the oracle's answer moved).
