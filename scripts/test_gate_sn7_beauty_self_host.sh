# scripts/test_gate_sn7_beauty_self_host.sh — SN-7 gate:
# every *_driver.sno in corpus/programs/snobol4/beauty_suite/, under BOTH
# real modes (--run = m3 BINARY, --compile = m4 TEXT),
# diff=0 vs its pre-baked .ref file (SPITBOL ground truth where valid; some
# drivers have .ref files that reflect correct behavior SPITBOL itself fails
# on — see RULES.md on .ref authority).
#
# B-9 FIX (BOARD, s-earlier session): the loop previously read
# `for mode in --run --run --run` (before that, `--interp --interp --run`,
# mechanically flattened when --interp was eradicated project-wide) — it
# NEVER invoked --compile, so this gate has apparently never once measured
# mode 4 on beauty_suite. FAIL counts before this fix were exactly 3x the
# true --run-only fail count, all under the label "--run". Fixed to name
# both modes explicitly so a future flatten-style edit cannot silently
# collapse it again.
#
# BEAUTY-CN FIX (this session): the B-9 fix above invoked `--compile` and
# diffed its raw stdout against the behavioural `.ref` — but `--compile`
# alone only emits x86-64 TEXT asm to stdout, it does not assemble/link/run.
# Every one of the 17 "--compile" rows was diffing assembly text against a
# beautified/behavioural reference and FAILING 17/17, unconditionally, since
# the B-9 fix landed (verified: `--run` 17/17, `--compile` 0/17 at HEAD
# before this fix). Repaired to the same compile->gcc->run pipeline
# scorecard_snobol4.sh's run_one already uses for m4.
#
# Self-contained per RULES.md: paths derived from $0; no env deps.
