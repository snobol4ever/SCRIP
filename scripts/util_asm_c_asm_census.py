# util_asm_c_asm_census.py — ⛔ THE NO-ASM->C->ASM CENSUS (Lon 2026-08-20 s194, in-chat: "You must guarantee that no ASM -> C -> ASM.").
#
# WHY THE RULE EXISTS, MEASURED (FINDING-2026-08-20-s194c): the Byrd wire contract puts gamma in r10 and omega in r11
# (Lon s55) while RTCC banks r10/r11 as VM globals in rtccb[32] (x86_asm.h:12 "R10=7, R11=8"; bank/reload at :427/:428/
# :440/:441).  rtccb is a FLAT GLOBAL -- one slot per register, program-wide, WITH NO NESTING.  So when emitted asm calls
# a C function and that C function re-enters asm, the INNER activation banks its wires into the SAME two slots and the
# OUTER activation's continuations are lost.  beauty's M1 SIGSEGV is exactly this: at the fault r11 = rip = &rtccb.
# The shape is the defect; forbidding the shape retires the whole class instead of defending against instances.
#
# WHAT IT COMPUTES: the intersection of
#   (a) C functions CALLED FROM EMITTED ASM   -- the x86("call*", ...) callees and the baked addresses of src/templates/**
#       and src/emitter/** (asm_callees)
#   (b) C functions that TRANSITIVELY REACH an asm activation entry  -- rt_proc_enter & siblings, computed (asm_entries)
# Anything in both is an ASM -> C -> ASM road.
# PRINTS one line per road (its shortest path to an asm entry), then BY_ENTRY entry=E roads=N witness=F per asm entry a
# shortest road ends at, largest class first (the cto 2026-10-09: each class is rowed with its witness), then COUNT=N.
# --roads-by-entry (the ceo 2026-10-09, for the C-to-BB removal): instead, for EVERY asm entry, every emitted callee that
# reaches THAT entry (a road reaching two entries is listed under both), as ROAD entry=E from=F path=F -> ... -> E, then
# CALLER entry=E caller=C roads=N per C function that calls E directly on those paths (the caller a removal converts or
# leaves as a bomb), then ENTRY entry=E roads=N; the selftest and COUNT are the same as the default mode's.
#
# ⛔ LIMITATIONS, STATED SO NOBODY READS THIS AS COMPLETE.  It is a STATIC, NAME-BASED call graph over src/runtime/**.c:
#   1. INDIRECT CALLS ARE INVISIBLE.  A call through a function pointer (p->fn, a dtp slot, a jump table) is not an edge
#      here.  That is a REAL hole and it is the direction the machine actually uses most, so a count of 0 from this tool
#      would NOT prove the property -- it would prove only that no NAMED road remains.
#   2. It does not model the killswitches; a road refused at runtime still counts as a road.
#   3. It parses C by regex.  It is validated on every run against a PLANTED road (SELFTEST_C / SELFTEST_CPP: a synthetic
#      asm entry, a C body that calls it, an emitted call to that body, and two decoys that only take the entry's address)
#      and REFUSES to report unless it finds the road, skips the decoys, and counts exactly one more than the tree; the
#      gate also plants two roads (--plant DIR) and requires both -- an analysis that cannot find a road put there on
#      purpose has no business grading the tree.

# ⛔ THE SELFTEST IS A PLANTED ROAD, NOT A FOUND ONE (CEO-554, CEO-1576).  It was a MEASURED road (beauty's s194 M1
# path, then the Raku APPLY of an indirect name ending at rt_proc_enter on SCRIP 7016f6e25); CEO-1576 landing 3 deleted
# rt_proc_enter and every sibling C could reach, the road ceased to exist, and an instrument anchored on its witness died
# the day the witness was cured.  The fixture below is the shape the census exists to see, written down once: an asm
# entry that jumps through a register, a one-line C body that calls it, a multi-line C body the emitter calls by name,
# and two decoys (one-line and multi-line) the emitter also calls that only DECLARE the entry in its body and returns its address -- the shape of
# rt_goto_resolve_x handing back rt_setexit_continue_tramp, which the census once read as a call and counted as 112 roads.
