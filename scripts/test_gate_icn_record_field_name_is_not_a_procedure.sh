# WHAT IT PINS, AND WHY THE SNOBOL4 ARM IS NOT DECORATION. rt_builtin_is_known() answers YES for any live
# record FIELD name, and it is right to: SNOBOL4's DATA('PT(A,B)') really does mint A(X) and B(X) as callable
# field-accessor functions, and A(X) = 9 really does assign through one. ICON HAS NO SUCH FUNCTION -- a field
# is reached only as r.a -- so the same YES made every field name answer proc() as "function <name>", and a
# string in call position naming one (errors.icn line 38, `"a"(1,2,3)`, under `record array(a,b,c,d,e,f,g)`)
# was judged INVOCABLE by icn_call_value_name_invocable, fell through to the by-name dispatcher, and raised
# its 106 carrying NV_GET("a") -- &null -- where icont carries the string "a" that named the callee.
# ⭐ THE SHAPE TO REMEMBER: the offending value of a failed call is the CALLEE EXPRESSION'S OWN VALUE, so
# `t(t)` on an unassigned t correctly reports &null and `"a"(...)` must report "a". Both reach the dispatcher
# as a bare `const char *`, which cannot tell a variable's name from a string that IS the callee -- so the
# distinction has to survive further up, in whether proc() calls the name invocable at all.
# ⛔ A one-witness probe CANNOT see this: with no record declared in the file, `"a"(1,2,3)` is already right.
# The declaration is the ingredient, and it sits 37 lines away from the expression that goes wrong.
#
# WANTS ARE CUT FROM THE ORACLES, NOT TYPED: arm r1 from Arizona icont/iconx (lib_oracle_flags.sh paths),
# arm s1 from `sbl -bf`. Both arms of r1 (m3 and m4) must equal icont byte for byte.
