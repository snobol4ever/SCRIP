# test_gate_gc_the_unmapped_spine_store_witness_answers_its_oracle_at_every_band_point.sh -- THE PROPERTY ARM OF
# THE cto's UNMAPPED-STORE ROW, PROMOTED TO THE BLOCKING SET ON THE DAY IT WENT GREEN (cto 2026-09-20, MODE TENET).
#
# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS RATHER THAN A PROMOTION OF THE ROW'S OWN GATE.  test_gate_gc_a_safe_point_stores_into_a_
# mapped_slot.sh said in writing, in its arm (g) and in its Makefile line, that it "moves to a blocking arm the day
# arm (f) goes green".  Arm (f) went green today on the cfo's DT_X landing (83b8bc9d2).  ⛔ HONOURING THAT SENTENCE
# LITERALLY WOULD HAVE BEEN WRONG TWICE: that gate is still RED at arm (h) BY DESIGN -- (h) is the row's own score
# and exists so the DONE-WHEN cannot go green on another seat's cure -- and its census over 49 witnesses costs
# MINUTES, which under MODE TENET condition 2 is charged to ten seats through an essentially serial set.  So the
# PROPERTY was promoted and the CENSUS was not.  A gate that declares a promotion it should not perform is the same
# defect as a design page stating a property nothing enforces (CTO-99).
#
# WHAT IT GUARDS, AND WHY hq_snobol4's BLOCKING GATE DOES NOT ALREADY.  The class is one they own and cured the
# same evening -- SNO$MKEXPR mints a DT_X name string in the collected heap and gc_cell_visit, the emitted-stack
# cell recognizer, did not list DT_X -- and their test_gate_gc_a_bare_deferred_expression_name_survives_every_
# collection_point.sh walks 200 arms over ten witnesses of it, blocking, in 2.9s.  ⭐ THAT GATE DOES NOT RUN THIS
# WITNESS.  hb_mkexpr_unmapped_spine_store.sno is the cto's, cut for the unmapped-store row, and it reaches the
# class through a different program shape.  Two roads into one class are worth their cost when the cost is
# seconds; and this witness is the one whose store the census NAMES at off=-24 on graph=main, so a red here is
# attributable to a site rather than to a language.
#
# ⛔ THE BAND IS NOT A STRAIGHT LINE THROUGH THE POINTS SOMEBODY ALREADY KNEW ABOUT (CEO-1024; hq_prolog, hq_raku
# and hq_snobol4 each measured a piece of this the same evening).  The witness's historical BASE band was
# `. X X . X . . X . . . .` over stress 0..20, so the X at 8 sits outside the old [0..4] band a cure could have
# closed while leaving the witness wrong; hq_raku's map family lives at stress 1..6 and is INVISIBLE at 8 and
# above; hq_snobol4's ERRTEXT witness is red at 25 while green at 10, 12, 16, 20, 35 and 50.  The thirteen points
# below span all three regions.  BOTH MODES ARE WALKED because the modes diverge in WHERE: hq_snobol4 measured
# their family's base reds as m3 {1,2,4,8} and m4 {1,2}, so an m3-only arm is a band with a hole in it.

# ⛔ THE FRESHNESS GUARD, AND IT IS HERE BECAUSE THIS GATE'S OWN CLASS OF DEFECT REACHED THE GATES BUILT TO CHASE

# set at 15:03:52 without rebuilding, and 260 arms refused one at a time for that one reason -- while the DARK
# run finished in HALF the wall clock of the honest one, so a seat optimising for a quick gate was being
# rewarded for measuring nothing.  A gate that grades ./scrip with no guard will one day grade a binary older
# than the cure it is testing and call it green.  One line, and the staleness rule itself lives in exactly one
# place (gate_require_fresh in lib_gate.sh) -- this is its calling convention, never a second copy of it.
