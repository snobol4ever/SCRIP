# Row icon-a-binop-whose-operand-is-fail-aborts-at-the-emit-guard-instead-of-folding (cto, 2026-09-11), from the
# coo's IPL compile-tier report: corpus/packages/icon/ipl/progs/fset.icn aborted rc=134 with
#   FATAL emit_drive: IR op=3 HAS a template and its own case REFUSED AT A GUARD -- emit.cpp:1571
# op=3 is IR_BINOP and 1571 is its operand-slot guard. `1 || fail` lowers to a BINOP whose second operand is an
# IR_FAIL node, IR_FAIL carries no result slot, so emit_binop_opnd_slot returned -1 and the guard refused a node
# that can never be entered at all. cf_run now folds such a node to IR_FAIL before the emitter ever sees it.
#
# ⛔ `fail` IS NOT `&fail` AND THE ORACLE IS THE ONLY THING THAT SETTLES IT. In Icon, `fail` makes the ENCLOSING
# PROCEDURE fail immediately, so `suspend 1 | fail | 3` yields 1 and NOT 1,3 -- a first cut of this cure rewired
# a fail-entry disjunction branch to the next alternative, which reads like the obvious fix, matched no oracle,
# and was reverted. Every expectation below is PINNED from Arizona icont/iconx 9.5 (/home/resources/icon-master),
# measured 2026-09-11; the gate is hermetic and never consults the oracle at run time.
#
# ⛔ p06/p07 ARE THE LOAD-BEARING CONTROLS, not padding: the fold deletes a node, and the way to break it is to
# delete more than the unreachable one. p06 is the same alternation with no `fail` in it and must still generate
# all three; p07 puts a SIDE EFFECT in the folded BINOP's live operand and must still print it, because the fold
# rewrites only the consumer and must leave the operands it dropped wired and running.
