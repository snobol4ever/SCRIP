# test_gate_pas_a_set_held_in_a_record_keeps_its_members.sh -- a set stored in a field of a heap record, or in a field of an element
# of an array of records, keeps its members, as fpc -Miso does (row pascal-p4-self-hosts-under-scrip..., ceo CEO-1311)
#
# MEASURED 2026-09-27 by hq_pascal, both modes. A Pascal set is a 32-byte bitmap; a heap record and an array of records are held as
# one string of SOH-separated fields, and their writers flattened each value with to_cstring/strlen, so a bitmap was cut at its first
# NUL byte (a byte 0x01 would split the record) and read back as the empty set. P4's compiler stores every set constant with
# new(lvp,pset); lvp^.pval := cstpart, so generation 1 wrote all 154 of them as ldc() -- the only difference from the fpc-built
# reference P-code -- and P4's interpreter stores them in store[scp].vs and searches the table with store[q].vs = s, which failed,
# and the failure left its procedure before readln, so the next P-code line was read one character early.
# THE CURE, Pascal's own nodes only: the five __pas_* record writers flatten through pas_cell_cstring, which writes a set bitmap that
# holds a NUL or SOH as ESC plus 64 hex digits; a set assigned into an element of a string-held array is wrapped in __pas_set_cell,
# the same encoding; pas_set_bits, the one decoder every set operator already uses, reads it. The shared arr_set_pure is untouched.
# FOUND BY THIS GATE'S OWN ARMS AND CURED WITH IT: (a) a field copied between two elements of an array of records was taken for a
# whole-element span copy, its already-flattened index multiplied by the record width again (store[13].vs := store[12].vs wrote slot
# 54 of a 42-slot array; store[j].vi := store[i].vi copied nothing) -- pas_arrrec_flatten now marks the node it builds as a field
# access; (b) the range constructor [a..b] (__pas_setrange) was not a set expression, so p^.s <= [1..5] compared numbers (error 102).
#
# ARMS, both modes, stdout and exit code cut LIVE from fpc -Miso: (1) hrec -- a set in a heap variant record's field, read directly,
# through with, through an array of pointers, copied to a set variable, and stored from a constructor; (2) arec -- P4's interpreter's
# store: a set in an array of variant records, compared, searched with repeat..until, copied cell to cell, tested with in.
# FAILS on the parent 964982d54 in both arms. FAIL_ONCE=1 corrupts arm (2)'s ref.
