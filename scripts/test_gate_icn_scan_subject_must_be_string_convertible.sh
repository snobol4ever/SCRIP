echo "graded=$GRADED FAIL=$FAIL (8 rejects x2 modes: a scan subject that is not string-convertible raises Icon 103, pinned from icont/iconx v9.5.25a; 4 accepts x2: string/integer/real/cset must still convert. The refusal is raised through core_icn_error, so it honours &error/&errorlimit like every other Icon error; and 11 CONVERSION accepts x2 -- 10 added 2026-09-10 by hq_U when that class was CURED, plus conv_pos_top graded 2026-09-11 when the top-level route was re-measured cured: under &error := -1 each of these raises 103/104/101 and the box must CONCEDE, so the alternative runs and the program reaches its next statement, exactly as icont/iconx v9.5.25a does -- every one of the 10 verdicts was re-cut from the oracle, not from us. ⛔ THIS PARENTHESIS USED TO EXCLUDE THEM, naming &error conversion a separate pre-existing class and citing FINDING-2026-09-09-hq_U-the-checked-icon-helpers-raise-but-their-boxes-have-no-failure-edge-so-ampersand-error-converts-nothing.md. The gap was load-bearing and not clerical: a guard that RAISES correctly and a guard whose answer nobody reads are indistinguishable from outside, so the 8 rejects above passed for days over a scan family that, one &error assignment away, SIGSEGVd in memcmp on a NULL subject (conv_match is that exact witness) and looped forever on move(\"a\") (conv_move). ⭐ The rejects grade the raise; only these 11 grade the EDGE the raise is supposed to take. ⛔ AND THEY DO NOT ALL DISCRIMINATE, which is stated here rather than left for a reader to assume, because a gate that does not say WHAT KIND of wrongness it can see prints a denominator describing its arms and not the defect space: MEASURED on the pre-cure binary, 5 of the 11 go RED (conv_scan wrong VALUE list_2(0), conv_match rc=139 SIGSEGV, conv_move and conv_tab wrong VALUE, conv_pos_top answers 1 where icont concedes) and 6 do NOT (conv_pos inside a scan, conv_upto conv_any conv_many conv_find conv_bal -- pre-cure rt_scan_needle coerced the rejected list to the empty string and the box then failed for its own ordinary reason, so the OUTCOME was right by accident while the mechanism was wrong). Those 6 are ORACLE-AGREEMENT arms, not detectors; they are kept because they pin agreement with icont and would catch a future cure that overshoots into refusing a legal case, and they must never be counted as evidence that this class is detectable. ⛔ conv_pos_top IS NOW GRADED, AND THE PARAGRAPH THAT USED TO SIT HERE WAS STALE IN BOTH HALVES -- replaced rather than quietly swapped, because it is the exact failure this gate exists to catch. It said the top-level route is still OPEN as of 2026-09-10 and named an hq_U row for whoever took it; RE-MEASURED 2026-09-11 the witness is byte-identical to iconx in BOTH modes, and the MECHANISM is right and not merely the outcome: under &error := -1 the raise decrements &error from -1 to -2 and leaves &errornumber 101 with &errorvalue \"a\", exactly as the oracle does. A gate carrying prose that sends the next seat hunting a closed defect is the command-v-icont class wearing a different hat -- a FALSE PREMISE that no arm can contradict, because the arm it described was the one deliberately not run. ⛔ ITS STATED MECHANISM WAS ALSO WRONG, which matters more than the staleness: it said pos(\"a\") lands in the by-name leaf at BID_pos where to_int yields 0 and the leaf answers 1. That leaf is guarded by scan_pos greater than 0 and at top level scan_pos is 0, so the call never reaches it. gdb on core_icn_error gives the real frame -- core_icn_builtin_argcheck (src/runtime/core/core.c:380) fires from rt_call_arr_impl (by_name_dispatch.c:4348) BEFORE any leaf, off a table whose first entry is the one for pos. ⭐ AND IT IS A REAL DETECTOR, PROVEN BY RUNNING IT rather than by the note it inherited: deleting that one table entry and rebuilding reproduces the original symptom verbatim -- the witness answers 1 where icont concedes, &error stays -1 and NO error is recorded at all. Two nearby things were checked and are NOT the guard: neutering the core_icn_int_operand_ok call in bb_scan_pos.cpp changes nothing on this route (top-level pos does not go through that box -- --dump-ir shows a plain CALL pos), and BID_pos is absent from icn_argtype_gate entirely.
