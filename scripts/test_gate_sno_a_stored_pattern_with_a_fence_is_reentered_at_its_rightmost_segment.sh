# test_gate_sno_a_stored_pattern_with_a_fence_is_reentered_at_its_rightmost_segment.sh -- A PATTERN HELD IN A VARIABLE OR BUILT AT
# RUN TIME THAT CARRIES A FENCE IS STILL RE-ENTERED WHEN A LATER ELEMENT FAILS: backtracking into it resumes its rightmost segment, as
# SPITBOL does, instead of failing it whole (hq_snocone 2026-09-27; Lon 2026-09-27: "Get the parser_*.sc programs to 100%.").
#
# MECHANISM: src/lower/lower_snobol4.c gives a stored (PAT$) or runtime-built (RT$) pattern graph a resume root, body_root, from the
# carrier build's out_brt (sno_pat_carrier_build -> sno_pat_publish_body_root). Two roads left it NULL, so an outer ARBNO or
# alternation could not re-enter the pattern and failed it whole:
#  (i) a TOP-LEVEL fenced sequence took the sno_pat_node road and published no out_brt at all; now the fenced TT_SEQ hands back its
#      rightmost segment's own resume tail (scx_t.seq_rtail, the n_rt sno_seq_nary gives a run: its rightmost generator), and the
#      fenced branch keeps its seam-tier gate (1 or 3) -- the cto's ruling 2026-09-27: a redo of a sequence re-enters its rightmost
#      segment. Witnesses 1, 2 and 7 (hq_snobol4's fence-then-operand-then-alternation row, from SPITBOL test program 4's GOTO_FIELD).
#  (ii) a pattern with NO top-level FENCE but one NESTED inside an element (a keyword Id = ANY(..) FENCE(SPAN(..) | epsilon) under an
#      immediate assignment) was counted fenced by sno_pat_contains_fence at any depth, so its tier-2 tail was refused and the graph
#      was rootless: the switch row of parser_snocone.sc (ctl_switch, ctl_switch_default), where backtracking into the switch's
#      ARBNO(*CaseArm | *DefaultArm) could not re-enter the arm to grow its inner ARBNO(*Command). Now such a pattern takes the
#      fence-free road's root. Witness 8.
# CONTROLS that must stay as SPITBOL answers: 3 (no FENCE), 4 (rightmost segment all literals: tier 2, stays rootless), 5 (the FENCE
# is the rightmost element: sealed, the match FAILS in SPITBOL too), 6 (an ARBNO then a literal), 9 (a literal tail).
#
# ARMS: (1) mode 3 and (2) mode 4 run one witness program of nine statements, each printing a YES or NO line; the ref is CUT FROM THE
# ORACLE at run time and every line must match byte for byte.
