# test_gate_pas_prelude_units_in_sync.sh -- SCRIP'S PASCAL PRELUDE UNITS AND THE TABLE SCRIP EMBEDS AGREE (hq_pascal 2026-10-10, row
# pascal-uses-and-units-compile-time-whole-program-...; CEO-1611).
#
# The units a uses clause names and no file beside the program supplies -- sysutils, math, strings, strutils -- are SCRIP's own
# Pascal under src/parsers/pascal/prelude/<unit>.pas, embedded by scripts/util_gen_pascal_prelude_units.py into the committed
# src/parsers/pascal/pascal_prelude_units.inc, as the Prolog prelude libraries are (test_gate_pl_prelude_libs_in_sync.sh). A unit
# changed without regenerating, or a table edited by hand, would ship a unit SCRIP's source no longer states.
#
# THE ARMS. (1) --check over the committed tree: rc 0 in sync, rc 1 STALE. (0) SELF-TEST, every run, on scratch copies: a table that
# differs from what the generator writes must read STALE; a unit changed beside an unchanged table must read STALE; an empty prelude
# directory must refuse rc=2. An instrument that cannot see its plants proves nothing by passing: the gate refuses. No build; ~1 s.
# rc=0 in sync · rc=1 stale · rc=2 refused.
