# its wall clock printed in ms, and the census reads RED (rc 1) when any single run exceeds <max_ms> -- Lon's point convention is
# 0.5 to 5 s per point (RULES.md THE KERNEL CONVENTION; CEO-1264), so a kernel whose one run takes 20 s makes every three-angle grading of it
# cost twelve runs of 20 s (CEO-1564: RakBench's 3293 s a pass were four such kernels). rc 2 when the kernel, the binary or the corpus is
# missing: a census that cannot measure says so. Mode 3 only: the kernel's own work, no harness angles.
