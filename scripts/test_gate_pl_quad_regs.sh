# test_gate_pl_quad_regs.sh -- THE QUAD GATE: no r12-r15 write reachable from a Prolog graph outside the TR/B/ROOT/BALL helpers,
# in emitted mode-4 .s and in the rtx asm it reaches (ARCH-PROLOG-BYRD-BOX-TRANSLATION.md § E instrument lane; RULES.md § THE
# PROLOG REBUILD GATE clause 5 -- the instrument lane never touches src/; minted by hq_P 2026-09-02, row
# prolog-quad-gate-no-r12-r15-write-outside-tr-b-root-ball).  Lon's grant: r12 = TR (the trail), r13 = B (youngest live choice
# frame), r14 = ROOT (the ζ-STANDING record), r15 = the ball or 0 -- live for the whole run.  The analysis is pl_quad_regs_scan.py
# (read its header: the enrolment table IS the contract; a rung that adds a legitimate B/TR/BALL writer enrols ONE shape there).
# POPULATION: every origin `ladder__rungNN_*` of corpus/tests/prolog/ALL.csv (all rungs, or --to N) and every `probe_plz` origin,
# materialised out of the master by lib_master_extract.sh, PLUS every .pl under corpus/demos/prolog and corpus/benchmarks/prolog
# (recursive: bench/, vanroy/, src/swi-*, the preludes).  Each is compiled to
# mode-4 TEXT (`scrip --compile -o`).  During the rebuild most corpus programs REFUSE with "not on the ladder yet -- rung N lands
# it"; those are COUNTED and printed, never graded and never green.  A witness that compiles is graded; zero compiled witnesses
# is UNPROVEN rc=2.  ⛔ Only mode-4 TEXT is read (MODES MAY DIVERGE: the verdict names its mode and does not bind mode 3).
# FAIL-ONCE IS BUILT IN, EVERY RUN, BEFORE THE REAL RUN IS TRUSTED (INSTRUMENT LAWS; a guard and its canary must not share a
# failure mode): (c1) the first compiled witness with `mov r13, rax` injected inside its first box must scan RED; (c2) a synthetic
# rtx routine that writes r14, reached by an injected `call`, must scan RED; (c3) the scanner with no input must REFUSE rc=2.
# A canary that does not turn red makes the gate UNPROVEN(2) -- a scanner that cannot say no certifies nothing.
# SUPERSEDES the label-allow-list version this seat minted at 4253dd88 (born red, QUAD_HELPER_RX over emitted LABELS, opt-in
# --self-test, not in make test): at rung 0 that design could go green only by naming `main`/`main_α` -- which admits ANY write
# under those labels -- and its ASCII-only awk did not follow the Greek-lettered rtx routines (rt_gen_spine_pass_γ/ω) in the
# reachability arm.  What survives: QUAD_HELPER_RX is still honoured, now as the rtx ROUTINE-name allow-list (the rung-1 brief's
# wording; a whole asm routine whose job is the trail IS the helper); emitted-code enrolment is a (site, register, shape) row.
# MEASURED at mint (SCRIP db299d41 / corpus 9c6489879, the rung-0 tree): ladder=12 probe_plz=9 corpus=145 -> compiled=1 (rung 0 hello),
# refused(not-on-the-ladder-yet)=163, other-compile-fail=2 (a parse error in the two swi det.pl copies, the ladder runner's
# business); writes=5, all five ROOT seeds (driver `mov r12,[0x70000000]` + `xor r14d,r14d`; root-α
# `xor r13d,r13d` `xor r15d,r15d` `lea r14,[rsp+64]`); rtx reachable=3 (rt_gen_spine_pass_γ/ω, rt_gen_spine_resume_enter),
# rtx writes=0.  The tree-wide informational sweep (`--rtx-scan-all`) finds the ONLY r12-r15 writers in all 47 rtx routines are
# three push/pop-bracketed scratch uses of r12 in rt_match_replace (SNOBOL4), preserved for the caller.
# EXIT: 0 clean · 1 a violation · 2 UNPROVEN (cannot measure: no binary, no master, zero compiled witnesses, a canary not red).
