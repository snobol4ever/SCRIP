# test_gate_gc_the_tiny_arena_is_the_default_of_gc_testing.sh -- LON'S RULE HELD BY ITS MECHANISM, NOT BY DISCIPLINE.
#
# ⛔⭐ THE RULE (Lon 2026-09-19 16:1x CDT, in-chat to the ceo, verbatim: "Actually, for all GC testing all seats should
# use a tiny arena to exasperate all the problems all the time. Do you not agree?"; ceo CEO-931/934/938, RULES.md
# ⛔⭐ THE DEFAULT IS 128 KB SINCE 2026-09-21 17:3x (Lon, in-chat to the ceo: "So let's take the default GC arena down to 128 KB."; ceo CEO-1095). It is COMPILED IN as GC_HEAP_KB, so it travels with the
# binary and the blanket `export SCRIP_HEAP_MB ?= 1` arm 1 refuses is RETIRED rather than re-argued. MEASURED on two allocating witnesses: 128 KB is the PEAK of exasperation, NOT the floor -- icon concat reads
# 1613 collections at 1 MB, 7533 at 256 KB, 21362 at 128 KB, then DOWN to 5429 at 64 KB because the live set stops fitting and the window GROWS. Below the peak, smaller is LESS exasperating. stdout byte-identical
# at every point. SCRIP_HEAP_KB is the knob and it REFUSES below 64 KB rather than clamping, because a run that grades at a size it was not asked for is a false reading.
# § THE INSTRUMENT LAWS, TWENTY-EIGHTH BATCH CLAUSE 2).  The committed window is SCRIP_HEAP_KB (rt_gcheap_init); at 1 MB
# a program collects wherever it allocates a megabyte -- measured on corpus/benchmarks/icon/bench_icnstr_concat_table.icn:
# ⛔ THE PROBE VALUES ARE KB AND MUST CLEAR THE 64 KB FLOOR: they were 1 and 7 when the knob was MEGABYTES, and as KB they abort
# every scrip invocation, which reads as "the harness printed no ARENA line" rather than as "the floor refused" -- a probe that
# cannot run is not a negative result about the thing probed.  256 and 512 are used, both distinct from the 128 default.
# 1614 collections at 1 MB, 788 at 2, 389 at 4, SIX at the shipped 512, stdout byte-identical at every size.  That is the
# exasperation Lon asked for, and it found real defects the same afternoon (SnoM 1959/1974 at 1 MB against 1963 at 512;
# IcnM 824/826 against 826).
#
# ⛔ WHY A GATE AND NOT A PARAGRAPH: this rule is a DEFAULT, and a default that lives only in prose is one forgetful
# recipe away from being off for everybody, silently, with every board still printing a number.  Three mechanisms carry
# it and this gate holds all three:
#   (1) `make test-arena` IS the pass -- a target-specific export of SCRIP_HEAP_MB_TINY over every gc gate and every
#       frontend smoke, announcing its arena first (`make arena`), mandatory per collector landing, its every red a ROW;
#       and the BLANKET export of the first cut stays out, because a landing gate grades the configuration we ship;
#   (2) corpus_suite_harness.py PRINTS the arena it ran under (the ARENA line and the SUITE_BOARD arena_kb= field),
#       because the same suite legitimately reads two populations on one binary and a number without its arena is not a
#       measurement -- the harness REPORTS, it does not default, since a silent default would change what every existing
#       published number means with no line of evidence anywhere;
#   (3) a gate that measures an ARENA-DEPENDENT quantity pins its own arena in the open, and the set of such gates is
#       DECLARED here, so a pin cannot spread quietly and turn the rule off one gate at a time.
#
# ⛔ THE FAIL-ONCE IS BUILT IN RATHER THAN PLANTED: arms 1, 2 and 4 read the SAME mechanism at THREE arenas (an override,
# the default, and unset) and require the reported value to TRACK.  A hardcoded "1" -- the failure this gate exists to
# catch, an instrument that reports the rule instead of measuring it -- passes a single-arena arm and fails these.
# FAIL_ONCE=1 additionally plants a phantom name into arm 3's declared set and requires arm 3 to red.
# ⭐ EVERY ARM WAS PROVEN BOTH WAYS BEFORE THIS GATE LANDED (ceo, 2026-09-19, plants reverted from backups and the tree
# rebuilt after each): `:=` in place of `?=` on SCRIP_HEAP_MB_TINY reads TINY=3 as 1 and reds arm 1; re-landing the blanket
# `export SCRIP_HEAP_MB ?= 1` reds arm 1 on its own clause; a hardcoded `_arena_mb = "1"` in the harness reds arms 2 AND 4;
# FAIL_ONCE=1 reds arm 3.  Pass-once on the landed tree: 4 of 4 arms, 5 seconds at load ~1.

# The full 360-arm set then read 326 green / 32 red / 2 refused, and classifying the reds says the shape was wrong, not
# the rule: gates that grade the SHIPPED configuration's behaviour flipped red for an arena nobody ships (gc2's Arizona
# witness and the co-expression frame image are green at 512, red at 1 MB) while other reds were standing reds the export
# would have been blamed for.  A LANDING GATE GRADES WHAT WE SHIP; the tiny arena is the mandatory SECOND pass and every
# red it finds is a ROW.  This arm holds both halves: the pass exists and tracks its knob, and the blanket export stays out.
