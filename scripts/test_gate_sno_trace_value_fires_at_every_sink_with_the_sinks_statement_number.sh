# ⭐ WITNESS GATE for rung18 of row snobol4-ladder-every-feature-in-isolation-with-variations (cfo 2026-09-13).
# The SPITBOL manual's 'V'/'VALUE' entry (Ch10 p.147) names THREE sink classes -- "Assignment statements, as
# well as conditional and immediate assignments within pattern matching" -- and SCRIP fired at all three.  What
# it got wrong was the BANNER, measured on 119fddd6c in BOTH modes: every sink that is not a plain `NAME = expr`
# printed `****0*******` for its statement number, because every comm_var() call site in the C runtime passed a
# LITERAL 0 for stno and only the code-generated bb_assign_global box baked in the real one -- and the immediate
# ($) sink printed `****18790523`, a HEAP POINTER, because rtx_match.s left rcx/r8/r9 uninitialised at its
# comm_var call (the assembly-thunk shape of FINDING-2026-09-13-hq_C).  Separately the banner printed a captured
# substring to the END OF THE SUBJECT -- 'BCD' for a capture of 'B' out of 'ABCD' -- because trace_spell_value
# ignored the descriptor's slen; the CELL was always right, so only the trace lied.
# ⛔ ARM 5 IS A CONTROL, NOT DECORATION: the plain-assignment sink was already correct before the cure (3 of the
# rung's 10 forms were green on the pre-cure binary) and it is the arm a rewrite of the stno path would move first.
