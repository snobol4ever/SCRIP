# Enforces the surviving COMPLETION TESTs of the TEMPLATE-ONLY EMISSION FACT RULE: EMITTER one-dispatch
# (one `case IR_` per kind WITHIN one switch) and no NEW bytes outside templates. Run before every commit
# alongside prove_lower.sh and the emitter gates. Exit non-zero on ANY violation.
#
# ⛔ TWO CHECKS RETIRED s173 (seat6, queue row gates-retire-4) under the HQ-55 ruling "RETIRE ALL FOUR"
# (GOAL-SCRIP-HQ.md row 18; census in FINDING-2026-08-19-s169-eight-audit-gates...). Both enforced
# contracts that no longer exist, and neither is coming back — do NOT re-mint either from this header:
#   (a) LOWER one-case-per-role-switch. It keyed on `static IR_t * lower_(value|pattern|goal)(`, the
#       role-dispatcher shape of the pre-reorg single src/lower/lower.c. That shape survives in NONE of
#       the 7 per-language lowerers (re-measured s173: 0 occurrences of ANY spelling under src/lower/),
#       so the scan was VACUOUS. A LOWER check for the current shape must be written against that shape,
#       not resurrected from this one.
#   (d) FACT-RULE block byte-identity across GOAL-{SNOBOL4,ICON,PROLOG}-BB.md. Those three files were
#       consolidated into the GOAL-*-100.md files, and the SHARED-LOWERER / ONE-DISPATCH blocks it
#       md5-compared did NOT survive the consolidation (re-measured s173: all 4 anchors grep == 0 in all
#       3 files). It was UNRUNNABLE, not mis-pathed — repointing only moved the failure — and it emitted
#       6 VIOLATIONs that held this whole gate permanently RED (rc=1), which is why GOAL-RAKU-BB.md's
#       2026-07-10 entry had to carry it as a stash-A/B-proven pre-existing red. CONCURRENCY_SKIP_D is
#       retired with it; the variable is no longer read.
# PATH CORRECTED s169 (seat1, queue row gates-dead-paths): src/emitter/emit_core.c is now
# src/emitter/emit.cpp; the ref had been dangling since the src reorg, so the emitter dup-label check
# reported "not found" instead of enforcing anything.

# `grep | sort | uniq -d` over the whole file flagged ~120 kinds the moment the path was corrected from the
# dead emit_core.c -- a FALSE RED. The rule is "one dispatch case per kind WITHIN one switch"; brace-depth
