# test_bench_snobol4_timed.sh -- run the TIME-BASED SNOBOL4 benchmark family and
# report THROUGHPUT (iterations per second) for sbl / scrip m3 / scrip m4.
#
# The legacy runner (test_bench_snobol4_modes.sh) reports wall(ms) for a fixed
# iteration count.  This one reports iterations for a fixed time budget, so:
#   * the numbers are directly comparable ACROSS engines (a ratio, not a delta);
#   * the suite's wall cost is bounded by construction (budget x programs x engines);
#   * a resolution-starved reading ("10 ms") cannot happen -- the elapsed window
#     is always ~BUDGET ms regardless of how fast the engine is.
# CORRECTNESS is gated here by CROSS-ENGINE AGREEMENT on the phase-1 "check:" line (sbl anchors it
# when sbl is among $ENGINES -- an absolute grade per RULES.md); a missing .ref is reported (/NO-REF)
# but its CONTENT is not diffed here. Only the measurement lines (iters:/ms:) are stripped before
# any comparison. STALE-COMMENT FIX (row bench-triangulation-3angle item 5, seat09 2026-08-27): this
# used to say ".ref diffed" -- true pre-s265, false since. The .ref itself is minted/graded
# separately by scripts/util_mint_bench_refs.sh (see this file's own :171 note for why).
# ⛔ row bench-external-cpu-and-elapsed-clock: sbl/s, m3/s, m4/s are the ITERATION COUNT divided by
# tools/bench_rusage's EXTERNAL cpu(user+sys) time for the winning rep, not the engine's own
# self-reported "ms:" line -- self-timing is never again the cross-engine authority (FINDING-2026-08-22-s253).
#
# ⛔ THE NOISE FLOOR IS NOT GLOBAL.  It is a property of the (KERNEL, ENGINE,
# THP-arm) triple and is BAKED PER ROW in NOISE-FLOOR.tsv beside this corpus by
# scripts/bake_noise_floor_snobol4_timed.sh.  Measured range: 0.2% .. 34.6% cv.
# An earlier draft of this file carried a single global "~4%" constant derived
# from one kernel (arith_loop); that is the s148 instrument error in new
# clothes and it is deleted.  The runner prints each row's min-detectable
# difference; a delta smaller than that is WEATHER, not a regression.
# ⛔ row bench-external-cpu-and-elapsed-clock (FINDING-2026-08-22-s253): min-det below reads
# NOISE-FLOOR.tsv's external-instrument columns (tools/bench_rusage, cpu = user+sys, elapsed =
# CLOCK_MONOTONIC, both outside either engine) -- NOT the self-timed TIME() column, which the two
# engines never measured in the same unit (SPITBOL CPU-time-patched, SCRIP wall-clock).  min-det(cpu)
# is the cross-engine authority; min-det(elap) prints alongside so the two are readable BY NAME.
#
# ⛔ MEASUREMENT CONDITION: SCRIP engines run with SCRIP_NOHUGE=1 by DEFAULT.
# Transparent huge pages make every allocating row unmeasurable in the shipping
# arm (table_access_t m3: cv 26.9%, min-detectable 80.7% -- you cannot see a 2x
# regression) AND cost throughput outright (2675/s -> 6042/s, 2.26x, with THP
# off).  Set NOHUGE=0 to reproduce the shipping-arm instability.

# 0.23x of the oracle with the stall and 0.46x without, array_sum 0.34x -> 0.97x.  A benchmark window
