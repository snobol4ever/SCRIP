# test_gate_gc_table_insertion_order_array_is_rooted_not_pinned_alive.sh -- A TABLE'S INSERTION-ORDER ARRAY IS A ROOT,
# NOT A PINNED ALIBI (cfo 2026-09-16, THE COLLECTOR, found on rung 2's first sliding measurement).
#
# MECHANISM, measured and not inferred: table_set_descr_d (aggregates.c) keeps every table's insertion order in
# tbl->ord, a DESCR_t array it rt_pinned_alloc's INTO THE COLLECTED HEAP as HB_WS, and gc_visit_tbblk (gc_heap.c)
# visited dflt, buckets and every pair but NEVER ord. Pinned means DOES NOT MOVE, not IS NOT RECLAIMED: the ord
# block is unmarked at every collection, so it is reclaimed under a live table, a live movable block slides into
# its bytes, and the NEXT INSERT writes a 16-byte key descriptor into whatever lives there now. On origin the
# conservative C-stack scan hides it most of the time (a stale stack word keeps the dead block alive by luck);
# under SCRIP_GC_STRESS the collection is precise and the corruption is deterministic: the witness below HANGS
# (rc=124) at stress 20 and 50 and ABORTS at 200 and 1000 with "[ZHP] heap verify FAILED ... (corrupt title)",
# both modes. On a SLIDING build (rung 2's probe) it is the Arizona gc2 SIGSEGV in rt_gc_visit_descr: a record
# instance slid into the dead ord's bytes and the next insert overwrote its type pointer with 0x100000002 -- the
# integer key descriptor itself. Caught by a hardware watchpoint on the corrupted word, writer table_set_descr_d:341.
# CURE: gc_visit_tbblk visits &t->ord (marks + registers the slot) and every t->ord[i] descriptor.
#
# ARMS: the witness (20 integer keys, six live 100-byte strings, COLLECT(), 40 more keys, print the strings and two
# lookups) in mode 3 and mode 4 at SCRIP_GC_STRESS=20 and =200, each byte-identical to the oracle's output and rc=0
# -- the two stress values are the two failure shapes (hang, corrupt-title abort); plus a STRUCTURAL arm that
# gc_visit_tbblk names t->ord, so removing the walk reds even when the behavioural arm is lucky.
# FAIL-ONCE / PASS-ONCE, 2026-09-16, two libraries distinct by sha256 (origin 699314447f17cf19, cure 669b670cba9c4e0b):
# origin, this gate verbatim: m3 AND m4 at stress 20 rc=124 (hang) -- the stress-200 arm happened to pass on origin in the gate's
# run and aborted rc=134 (corrupt title) in the hand run with SCRIP_ZETA_TELEM=1, so stress 20 is THE discriminator and 200 is kept
# as the second shape, not relied on. cure: all four behavioural arms rc=0 byte-identical, 1 s; the red run costs 24 s (two hangs).
