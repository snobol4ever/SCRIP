# test_gate_snobol4_master_named_set_equality.sh -- NAMED-SET EQUALITY instrument for the
# SNOBOL4 floor cutover (row snobol4-floor-cutover-to-the-one-flat-suite-board-equality-first).
#
# THE QUESTION THIS ANSWERS: since the per-family boards retired in favor of grading
# tests/snobol4/ALL.{sno,ref,csv} alone, did any program that used to be gradable become
# silently un-gradable -- present in neither the master nor a loud exclusion? A count match
# is not this proof (this project lost a day once to four honest totals from different
# populations); this checks every deleted file BY NAME.
#
# METHOD: for every commit that deleted a *.sno+*.ref pair from tests/snobol4/, probe/, or
# crosscheck/ during the consolidation, the pair is accounted for iff ONE of:
#   (a) some origin in ALL.csv ends with "__<basename>"            -- leaf program, absorbed directly
#   (b) the file's own path-derived family name has ANY entries    -- the file WAS an intermediate
#       in ALL.csv's family column                                    suite itself, absorbed wholesale
#   (c) the basename appears in ALL.excluded.txt                   -- loudly excluded, not lost
# Accounted for by none of the three is a genuine gap: exit 1 and name it.
#
# ⛔ COMMIT DISCOVERY IS THE UNION OF TWO SIGNALS, NOT A SINGLE DATE CUTOFF. `git log --since`
# filters by COMMIT date, which can diverge from the visible author date after a rebase --
# measured directly: three genuine pilot-conversion commits, author-dated inside the
# consolidation window, were silently excluded by a plain --since filter for exactly this
# reason. Union of (committed on/after START_DATE) and (message matches MSG_GREP) catches
# both; verified by spot-check that commits matching neither are unrelated pre-consolidation
# history (e.g. a March "crosscheck recategorization" refactor).
#
# Usage: bash scripts/test_gate_snobol4_master_named_set_equality.sh [START_DATE]
#   START_DATE defaults to 2026-08-24 (the ONE-FLAT-SUITE ruling date). Exit 0 = every deleted
#   graded pair accounted for. Exit 1 = a genuine gap was found, named. Exit 2 = could not
#   measure (master/exclusion files missing).
