# lib_subject_tree.sh -- THE SUBJECT TREE IS THE TREE THE SCRIPT LIVES IN.  Sourced, never executed.
#
# ⛔⭐ THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS TO KILL (measured by the coo 2026-09-13, reported against its OWN landing --
# an honest self-report, and the discipline this file exists to protect; row
# snobol4-a-gate-that-reads-the-main-tree-src-passes-in-a-worktree-while-origin-is-red):
# test_gate_no_weak_abort_stub.sh resolved the tree it graded from the MAIN root rather than from the tree it
# was invoked in, so a pre-landing preflight run in a second worktree read 33 arms 0 red WHILE ORIGIN WAS RED
# for about thirty-five minutes after f0d0adf5b landed a weak pas_gc_roots.
#
# ⭐ THE DEFECT IS NOT A TYPO, IT IS AN IDIOM.  Every instance has the same two hops:
#         S4E="${S4E_HOME:-$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/../.." && pwd)}"   # UP to the sibling root
#         SRC="$S4E/SCRIP/src"                                                     # DOWN into a HARDCODED name
# The first hop is correct and is the D-17 PORTABLE-HOME rule: siblings (corpus, .github, the oracles) really
# do hang off one root, and you really do have to go up to reach them.  ⛔ THE SECOND HOP IS THE BUG: it comes
# back down into the literal string `SCRIP`, which is the name of the MAIN checkout and of nothing else.  A
# worktree is a sibling of the main checkout, not a replacement for it, so the round trip lands in the tree you
# are NOT standing in -- and the gate then grades a tree the seat is not pushing.
#
# ⛔⭐ WHY IT IS SILENT, WHICH IS THE HALF THAT COST THIRTY-FIVE MINUTES OF RED ORIGIN.  The gate is not
# confused and does not guess: it prints `src: /home/claude_B/SCRIP/src`, names the tree, and grades it
# correctly.  Everything it says is TRUE.  It is simply an answer to a question nobody asked -- the same
# narrow-instrument shape as `command -v` answering "is it on PATH" when the reader meant "does it exist".
# A wrong-subject verdict has no symptom, because a verdict about the wrong tree looks exactly like a verdict.
#
# ⛔⭐⭐ AND THE PROVENANCE STAMP INHERITED IT, WHICH IS WHY THIS IS A LIBRARY AND NOT A ONE-LINE FIX.
# `gate_stamp` in lib_gate.sh carried the identical two hops, so the one line every seat cites to prove WHICH
# TREE a verdict came from named the main checkout too.  Measured here 2026-09-13 from an armed sibling
# worktree: the stamp printed `SCRIP=202d8bfff` with NO `-DIRTY` while the tree being graded was dirty.
# `-DIRTY` is described in lib_gate.sh's own comment as load-bearing, and worktree-blindness strips it in
# silence.  ⭐ The general form worth keeping: when a bug lives in the instrument that reports provenance, it
# does not merely produce a wrong answer -- it produces a wrong answer WEARING A CORRECT-LOOKING RECEIPT, and
# every downstream reader inherits the error with the confidence of a citation.
#
# THE RULE.  A script's SUBJECT -- its src, its `scrip` binary, its out/, its .git -- is resolved from the
# script's OWN location and never from a hardcoded repo name.  Siblings are still reached through the root.
# When the two disagree, say so; never silently grade the other one.
