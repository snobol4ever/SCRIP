# test_gate_sno_a_fence_after_a_live_deferred_thunk_finds_its_own_slots.sh -- A FENCE(P) AFTER A DEFERRED PATTERN WHOSE THUNK STAYS
# LIVE READS AND WRITES ITS OWN SLOTS (cfo 2026-09-30, found closing the ARBNO-then-FENCE hang row at SCRIP 32b404921/a7ed5c111).
# THE DEFECT, measured under gdb in mode 4 on the fixture: rsp falls 0x90 from the defer's alpha to the FENCE's alpha -- the 16-byte
# defer cell, the two continuations it pushes, and the frame of a thunk that stays live because P = ARBNO(' b') can recede -- while
# the depth tracker counts 16 for IR_MATCH_DEFER. FENCE1's zls slots are spelled [rsp+N] for the static depth, so its alpha stores
# land 128 bytes away among other nodes' fields; here the match head then retries from cursor 1 forever (sbl -bf: no).
# THE LAYOUT IS THE WITNESS: one statement fewer and the misplaced stores fall on dead slots and the program answers. The parent of
# the cursor cure (b1cde82b2) hangs 8 of 8; the cure hangs 4 of 6 with ASLR and 3 of 3 without -- so both arms run under
# setarch -R, where the reading is deterministic.
# ARMS: (1) mode 3 and (2) mode 4 print the ref cut from sbl -bf (scripts/fixtures/pattern/deferred_pattern_then_fence.{sno,ref})
# within 10 s. rc 0 both agree · 1 a hang or a diff · 2 no binary, no fixture, no setarch.
