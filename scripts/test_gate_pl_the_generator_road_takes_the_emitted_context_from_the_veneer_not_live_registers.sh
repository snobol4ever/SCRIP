# hq_prolog 2026-10-04, row prolog-bb-the-generator-road-takes-the-emitted-context-from-the-veneer-not-live-callee-saved-registers (the cfo's
# finding, 2026-10-04: rt_proc_call_gen_h captures rbx, r12-r15 with inline asm from inside C and restores them in the generator's thread for the
# emitted Prolog body -- whatever C frame sits between emitted code and that capture and keeps a value in a callee-saved register breaks the
# generator; the fixed-tables batch did exactly that (a VLA key in rt_pl_goal_gen_h_c kept its bookkeeping in a callee-saved register under
# gcc -O0, and a user portray/1 under format ~p died in rt_pl_tr_gc_sync with cx->tr pointing into the caller's stack; cured at 476b4fc91 by
# keeping that frame fixed-size, which is a workaround). The shape: the rtx entry veneer saves the five callee-saved registers into the context
# frame it already builds (tr, b, ball, then rbx, r14, r15), rt_proc_call_gen_h takes them as an argument, and the two C callers (the gen road
# and the writer's portray hook) pass the context's copy -- nothing C-side reads a live register.
# ARM 1: rt.c holds no inline-asm capture of callee-saved registers (the movq rbx/r12-r15 asm string count is 0; 1 on origin c5e4896b9).
# ARM 2: the cfo's witness (a user portray/1 under format ~p) answers 3 in m3 and m4 -- the behaviour the cure must keep.
# RED BEFORE on origin c5e4896b9: arm 1 counts 1.
