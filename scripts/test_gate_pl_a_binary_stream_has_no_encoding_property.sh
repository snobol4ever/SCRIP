# test_gate_pl_a_binary_stream_has_no_encoding_property.sh -- stream_property/2 must have NO SOLUTION for
# encoding/1 on a stream opened with type(binary), while a TEXT stream still reports the encoding it was
# opened with (row prolog-logtalk-stream-io-family-..., hq_R 2026-09-13, on the coo's board-pass regression
# report of builtins:lgt_unicode_stream_property_2_07 and _09).
#
# THE REGRESSION THIS PINS, AND IT WAS MINE. 94fde5d43 taught open/4 to accept encoding(E) and
# stream_property/2 to report it -- 15 Logtalk unicode cases that had been UNGRADABLE became graded -- and it
# made fh_encoding answer `octet` for a binary stream so a declared name could not win over the type. Two
# cases do not ask WHICH encoding a binary stream reports: they assert `\+ stream_property(S, encoding(_))`,
# so ANY answer satisfies the inner goal and the negation fails. The sibling pair on bom/1 kept passing,
# which is what made the shape specific and findable.
#
# ⛔⭐ THE CRITERION IS THE SUITE'S OWN EXPECTATION AND IT AGREES WITH NEITHER ORACLE -- measured 2026-09-13,
# and this arm exists so nobody "fixes" it back: on type(binary), swipl 9.0.4 answers encoding(octet), so
# SWIPL ITSELF WOULD FAIL those two cases, and gprolog raises domain_error(stream_property, encoding(_))
# because encoding is not a stream property for it at all. ISO/IEC 13211-1 7.10.2.13 lists ten properties and
# encoding is not among them; Logtalk's own comment above the cases says a binary stream should have no bom/1
# or encoding/1. So this is a DELIBERATE divergence from swipl, decided by the standard-derived suite rather
# than by an oracle diff -- and ARM 4 prints both oracles' answers on every run rather than hiding them,
# because an undocumented divergence is what gets "corrected" by the next reader with a swipl prompt open.
#
# ⛔ ARM 2 IS THE ARM THAT STOPS THE OVER-BROAD CURE. Deleting the encoding property outright passes ARM 1
# perfectly and silently un-grades the 15 cases 94fde5d43 unblocked. A cure that trades one case for another
# never lands (CEO-589), so the text-stream arm is graded beside the binary one, always.
# rc 0 green · 1 red · 2 could not measure.
