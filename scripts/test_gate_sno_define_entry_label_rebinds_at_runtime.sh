# DEFINE(proto, entry) rebinds an already-DEFINE'd function's ENTRY POINT, and the binding in force is the
# one the LAST EXECUTED DEFINE established -- never the last TEXTUAL one.  Gimpel's re-DEFINE idiom (COPYL,
# Algorithms in SNOBOL4 5.8) guards a self-call with it, so a statically-resolved entry is unbounded
# recursion, which is why this arrived filed as a stack-overflow-guard defect.  Both media, graded against
# the live oracle: the m4 half is the one that regressed silently before, because x86_load_ro emits the
# SYMBOLIC label in TEXT but bakes a compile-time pointer in BINARY, so a cure can pass one medium alone.
