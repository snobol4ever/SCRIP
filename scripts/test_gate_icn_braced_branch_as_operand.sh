# A control structure's CLOSING BRACE must not end the expression: icont continues parsing a binary
# operator after it, SCRIP raises "expected ; (got <op>)". Row
# icon-braced-control-branch-cannot-be-followed-by-a-binary-operator.
#
# ⛔ THE TWO FORMS NEED DIFFERENT ANSWERS, which is the trap in the obvious "just let the expression
# continue after }" cure -- measured against iconx 2026-09-05 (hq_B), x=1 in both:
#   case x of { default: 1 } + 2        icont = 3  -- the CASE VALUE is the LEFT OPERAND (1+2)
#   if x then {1} else {9} + 2          icont = 1  -- the operator is ABSORBED INTO THE ELSE BRANCH,
#                                                     i.e. if x then {1} else ({9}+2), NOT (if...)+2
# A cure that makes both bind as a left operand yields 3 and 3, and the second is then wrong while
# compiling cleanly -- a false green that only a VALUE check catches, never a compiles-or-not check.
#
# Scope, measured, so the cure is not narrowed to `case`:
#   any binary operator, not just ||| -- '+', '||', '<' all raise "expected ;"
#   LEFT operand only -- `1 + case x of {...}` already compiles
#   NOT every closing brace -- a bare block `{1} + 2` already compiles and gives 3
# Real-world origin: corpus/packages/icon/ipl/procs/io.icn:365 ends a procedure with
# `} ||| ([&null ~=== x[2]] | []);` and io.icn is linked by much of IPL (hq_I, IPL suite).
#
# ⛔ REFUSES rc=2 unless all 4 runs (2 witnesses x 2 modes) are graded -- never skip-as-success.
