# test_gate_gc_the_descriptor_kind_sets_are_a_declared_subset.sh -- ONE FACT, ONE AUTHORITY, EVERY DIVERGENCE
# WRITTEN DOWN (cto 2026-09-20, built to the cfo's shape on their ask CFO-141; the defect found by hq_snobol4,
# verified A/B/A by the cto at CTO-101; the third spelling named by the cfo at CFO-146).
#
# THE FACT: which descriptor kinds carry a heap payload.  gc_heap.c spells it FIVE times -- gc_visit_one (the heap
# visitor, handed a descriptor that IS one), gc_cell_visit (the emitted-stack recognizer, guessing whether a word
# pair is a descriptor at all), gc_tag_bears_ptr (the preceding-tag test in gc_walk_words), and the two halves of
# the maps reporter's own divergence census, gc_sniff_would_take and gc_type_says_ref.  They disagree, and the
# disagreement is how a whole descriptor kind (DT_X) went unrecognised on the emitted stack: a live value's block
# was swept while gc_visit_one would have marked it.
#
# ⛔ WHY NOT "THE SETS MUST BE EQUAL", which was the cto's first offer and which the cfo REFUSED for a reason that
# is better than the offer: an arm demanding equality would force DT_SNUL into the speculative recognizer, and
# DT_SNUL is 0x00 on a stack where zero is the commonest byte -- the gate would then ENFORCE the defect.  So the
# law is a DECLARED SUBSET: a copy may not exceed its authority, and every kind the authority has and a copy does
# not is either EXCLUDED WITH A REASON or UNDER-CURE WITH AN OWNER AND A ROW.  An unexplained divergence reds.
#
# ⛔ THE ARM THAT MAKES THIS SELF-CLEANING, and it is the half that is usually forgotten: a declaration is STALE
# the day its cure lands.  If DT_X appears in gc_cell_visit while the UNDER-CURE entry is still in the table, this
# gate goes RED -- so the bookkeeping cannot be skipped in either direction, and an exclusion cannot quietly
# become a parking space.
#
# ⛔ RED BY DESIGN ON THE DAY IT LANDS AND DECLARED AS SUCH (CEO-513): nine divergences carry no reason at all --
# gc_sniff_would_take is short of its authority by SIX kinds and gc_type_says_ref by FIVE.  Those two are
# INSTRUMENT halves: a kind missing there does not lose a value, it makes the census that would have FOUND the
# loss read agreement.  That is an instrument reporting success while it is not looking, which is the recurring
# failure the INSTRUMENT LAWS exist to catch, and it is why this gate names them rather than waiting for a cure.

# DIFFERENT ONES: a landing that cures four and opens four reads 7 against a baseline of 7 and this arm says
# nothing.  ⛔ AND IT COST A SEAT REAL TIME BEFORE IT WAS CURED: the cfo saw this gate red on origin, remembered

# prove the red was not theirs.  It was never theirs and it was never a regression -- it is this row's STANDING
