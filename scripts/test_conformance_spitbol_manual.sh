# ⛔⭐ THIS REFUSAL STANDS, AND HERE IS THE ANSWER TO ITS OWN QUESTION SO NOBODY RE-INVESTIGATES
# (hq_B 2026-08-30, row graders-denominator-audit-six-families). It asks "has the conformance sweep
# ever minted a witness?" -- YES: 132 of them. They were absorbed into the flat set by corpus
# 11a36c87 (Lon's ZERO-SUBFOLDERS + total-absorption ruling), which deleted probe_loose/ entirely.
# ⭐ BUT THIS IS NOT A COVERAGE HOLE AND MUST NOT BE "FIXED" BY RE-POINTING IT: all 132 carry a
# conformance origin/family in tests/snobol4/ALL.csv, NONE is in ALL.excluded.txt, and
# test_corpus_snobol4.sh grades the whole set (total=1726). So the witnesses ARE graded, every run.
# Re-pointing this script at ALL.* would duplicate the master board, not add coverage. It is a
# retirement candidate or a focused view, not a defect -- a corpus-layout call, deliberately not
# taken here. Contrast test_snocone_crosscheck_suites.sh, whose identical-looking refusal WAS a real
# hole (181 entries graded by nothing) and was re-pointed: the discriminator is whether a master
# board over the family's ALL.* set exists, and it must be checked per family, never assumed.
