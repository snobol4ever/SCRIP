#
# WHAT THIS PINS, and why it is three arms and not a diff. COLLECT() had two defects that a
# byte-for-byte oracle diff CANNOT be used to pin, because the one number it returns is the
# reporting engine's own heap size: SPITBOL says 129483 here and we say 536870912, and both are
# right. So the invariant is the DECISION and the DATATYPE, which are semantics, not the count:
#
#   (1) COLLECT() returns a NONZERO integer.  It used to return 0 -- rt_gcheap_free() reports
#       g_hp_end - g_hp_top and the arena is allocated LAZILY, so a program whose first heap touch
#       IS the COLLECT call measured a heap that did not exist yet and got 0 - 0. The regression
#       this arm guards is subtle: it only appears when nothing has allocated yet, so a witness
#       that does any string work BEFORE the call cannot see it. This one deliberately calls
#       COLLECT() as its very first act.
#   (2) DATATYPE(COLLECT()) is INTEGER, on both engines. This was already right and is pinned so a
#       future cure of (1) cannot fix the number by returning a string.
#   (3) COLLECT(N) SUCCEEDS for a small N and FAILS for an unsatisfiable N. The argument used to be
#       discarded outright ((void)a), so every call succeeded whatever was asked. Programs branch on
#       COLLECT(N), so that was a control-flow divergence, and it is the arm that actually matters.
#
# EVERY ARM IS CHECKED AGAINST sbl -bf IN THE SAME RUN rather than against a recorded .ref, because a
# .ref is evidence about a past oracle run and arm (3) is exactly the kind of decision an oracle swap
# could legitimately change. The oracle comes from lib_oracle_flags.sh, never a hand-built path.
# ⛔ The RET NUMBERS are compared for nonzero-ness and never to each other -- see above.
