# util_gc_dead_oracle.sh — deterministic dead-function oracle for the scrip binary.
#
# Method: recompile every translation unit with -ffunction-sections -fdata-sections
# (injected through the Makefile WARN hook, which is concatenated into CBASE/CRT/CXXRT
# but NOT into the link line), then re-link scrip from the section-split objects with
# -Wl,--gc-sections -Wl,--print-gc-sections. The linker proves, from the static call
# graph rooted at main + every address-taken symbol, which .text.<fn> sections are
# unreachable and strips them. Each stripped section is a provably-dead function.
#
# Output: /tmp/dead_current.txt — one bare function name per line, sorted unique.
# This is the ground-truth list the dead-code sweep consumes. Re-run after every
# removal batch to regenerate the authoritative remaining set.
#
# Caveats the consumer MUST honour (NOT decided here):
#   * Backend KEEP policy: js_/jvm_/net_/wasm_ symbols are dead under X86-ONLY but
#     are RETAINED. Filter them before refuse.
#   * Symbols reached only by dynamic by-name lookup (dlsym) would be false-positives;
#     scrip resolves its own runtime by baked address (the emitter takes &rt_*, which
#     the linker sees), so this class is empty for the scrip binary — but verify if the
#     resolution mechanism ever changes.
