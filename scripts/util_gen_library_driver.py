"""util_gen_library_driver.py -- THE DRIVER GENERATOR (ceo CEO-706 -> hq_B, rank 0, 2026-09-13).

WHY THIS EXISTS. 1,223 rows fleet-wide were filed as "cannot be graded" and only ~130 genuinely are.
The largest class is CONTAINER_OR_LIBRARY -- a library module with no entry point, which no runner can
execute and every runner therefore reports as SKIPPED. Lon's ruling: there is no such thing as
UNGRADABLE. The cure is a DRIVER: a small program that links the module, calls its documented
procedures, and is graded against a ref cut from the oracle. The technique is already proven in the
tree -- corpus/packages/snobol4/gimpel ships 144 hand-written drivers -- but 987 hand-written drivers
across four lanes is the wrong shape, so this tool builds the skeleton and cuts the ref.

WHAT IT IS NOT. It is NOT an author. `skeleton` emits a driver whose argument values are GUESSED from
the formal parameter names, and that guess is weak by measurement, not by accident: across the 336
DEFINEs in gimpel the formal names are S(65) X(29) L(29) A(28) N(21) Y(18) P(12) I(11) -- S/N/I/A/T
carry a real convention, X/L/Y/P carry none. So a guessed driver is a FIRST DRAFT A HUMAN FINISHES,
every guess is recorded in the driver's own header with the basis that produced it, and the thing that
makes the tool safe is not the guess, it is the REFUSAL below.

⛔⭐ THE REF IS CUT FROM THE ORACLE ALONE, AND THAT IS A DELIBERATE DIFFERENCE FROM THE TOOL NEXT DOOR.
corpus_suite_harness.py's `capture-oracle-refs` is the tree's other ref-minting authority and it is
more careful than this one in every respect but one: it mints only on THREE-WAY AGREEMENT (oracle text
== m3 text == m4 text). That contract is right for its own job (bootstrapping a family that is already
green) and WRONG for this one. A 987-program grading push whose refs exist only where SCRIP already
agrees with the oracle adds 987 green tests and ZERO information -- it cannot, by construction, show a
single gap. So this tool cuts from the oracle and from nothing else, per the standing law (a ref is cut
from the oracle, never from our output), and a driver whose oracle answer SCRIP gets wrong is exactly
the driver worth having.
⛔ AND THAT CHOICE IS WHAT MAKES THE DETERMINISM ARM LOAD-BEARING. With the three-way arm gone, the
self-diff below is the ONLY thing standing between a guessed driver and a permanently-red ref. hq_S's
witness, 2026-09-13: the AIS row could never have closed because ATN prints TIME deltas on 19 lines, so
two oracle runs of it differ on 38. A generator that cuts 900 refs without running the oracle twice
manufactures 900 permanently-red tests, each of which reads as a defect in the compiler.

THE FOUR ARMS, in the order the brief names them:
  1. `procs`     -- enumerate the procedures a module DEFINES (per-language, see enumerate_*)
  2. `skeleton`  -- emit a driver that links the module and calls each with plausible arguments
  3. `cut`       -- cut the ref BY RUNNING THE ORACLE, twice, and diffing it against itself
  4. REFUSE(2)   -- rather than emit a driver whose oracle run is empty, errors, or is nondeterministic
And the fifth, which the brief adds because a thin witness reports a thin denominator: every subcommand
prints COVERAGE -- procedures exercised over procedures defined -- so a driver exercising one procedure
of a twenty-procedure module is honest about being one twentieth of a witness.

⛔ THE ORACLE INVOCATION IS NEVER RE-DERIVED HERE. `cut` shells out to scorecard_snobol4.sh's `oracle`
verb, which exists precisely so a .ref can be minted through the same door the board grades through (a
ref minted under a different cwd, lib path, stdin or flag set than the board grades with is a pin that
can never match -- s191, seat5, twice in one session). See oracle_once() for the one wrinkle: that door
is currently shut to every seat but the coo, which is FINDING-2026-09-13-hq_B-the-one-ref-cut-door-is-
behind-the-one-runner-board-guard.md and a FLIP to the coo, not a re-implementation here.
