# test_gate_icon_scratch_names_are_not_tracked.sh -- the Icon scratch names (tmp1..tmp4) are IGNORED at the
# repo root and TRACKED NOWHERE, and no suite writes them into the source tree.
#
# ⛔⭐ THE MEASURED CASE (hq_I, 2026-09-13; landed by hq_B under CONCERN 5). SCRIP/.gitignore listed `tmp1`
# and `/tmp3` and NOT tmp2, NOT tmp4 -- while corpus/packages/icon/{arizona,jcon}_tests write all four
# (io.icn opens tmp1/tmp2 "w"; iobig.icn testio()s tmp3/tmp4). A stray 400KB tmp4 left by a suite run hq_I
# did not make turned their handoff banner ⛔ FAILURE on a sitting whose work was entirely pushed.
# ⭐ hq_I'S SENTENCE IS THE REUSABLE HALF: an ignore list that covers SOME of a generated set is worse than
# one that covers none, because the covered members train you to believe the set is handled. tmp1 and tmp3
# being ignored is exactly why nobody looked for tmp2 and tmp4.
#
# ⛔⭐⭐ WHY A GATE AND NOT JUST FOUR IGNORE LINES, WHICH IS THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS FILE. The suites' own
# comment already argues against ignoring: "ignoring the name silences the symptom while a test still writes
# into the source tree". Both automated writers ARE cured -- test_icon_all_rungs runs from ICN_SCRATCH
# (2026-08-30) and test_icon_arizona_suite snapshots each test dir and deletes what appeared (2026-09-04) --
# so the four ignore lines now cover only the HAND RUN, a human grading a program from the repo root. That is
# a mess, not a defect. ⛔ BUT AN IGNORED NAME IS INVISIBLE TO `git status` BY DESIGN, so the day a suite
# starts writing into the tree again, the ignore list is exactly what guarantees nobody notices. The ignore
# handles the human; THIS handles the regression. Neither one can do the other's job.
#
# ⛔ THE ARM THAT MATTERS MOST IS (2), TRACKEDNESS. handoff_status.sh says "commit them" about untracked
# output, and the obvious reading of that sentence is to COMMIT a 400KB generated artifact -- tmp3 was
# committed by accident once already and the ceo deleted it. A wrong instruction plus a plausible file is
# how generated output gets into a source repo, and it only has to succeed once.
#
# THE THREE EXIT CODES: 0 clean · 1 violation · 2 could-not-measure. Never skip-as-success.
