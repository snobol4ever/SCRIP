# test_gate_pas_readln_and_writeln_require_a_textfile.sh -- ISO 7185 6.9.2 / 6.9.4, refused at compile time
#
# MEASURED 2026-09-16 by hq_pascal on SCRIP e23184b28, both modes, working row pascal-pat-suite-427-to-100-percent-by-class.
# PAT 1842 was ACCEPTED SILENTLY, rc=0 with no output: `readln(f, i)` where f is `file of integer`. ISO 7185 6.9.2 requires
# readln's file parameter to be a textfile, and 6.9.4 requires the same of writeln. read and write have NO such rule --
# `read(f, x)` on a file of integer is perfectly legal -- so the check must discriminate between the two pairs.
#
# THE CURE: the parser already routes a TYPED file variable (the tfilevar registry) through its own dispatch for get, put,
# eof, reset, rewrite, read and write. readln and writeln were simply absent from that dispatch, so they fell through to
# the TEXT read path, which does not recognise a typed file as a stream at all -- it treated the file variable itself as
# the first item to read into and assigned a number to it. Adding the two names to the dispatch as a refusal both closes
# the ISO gap and removes that silent miscompilation. Decided in the parser; no generated code changes.
#
# ⛔ NOT INCLUDED, NAMED RATHER THAN QUIETLY SCOPED OUT: `page(f)` on a non-text file is the same rule at ISO 7185 6.9.5.
# No PAT witness exercises it, so it is not cured here and this gate does not claim it.
#
# ARMS: the one vendored PAT witness, required to be REFUSED with a non-empty diagnostic in BOTH modes -- the suite's own
# criterion. A second arm proves the cure DISCRIMINATES rather than refusing every file: a program that reads and writes a
# `file of integer` with read/write AND uses read/readln/writeln on a real `text` still compiles and runs, byte-identical
# to fpc -Miso. A third arm checks writeln is refused on a typed file too, which no PAT witness covers.
# FAIL_ONCE=1 flips the witness's expectation to prove the arm can fail.
