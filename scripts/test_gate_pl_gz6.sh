# test_gate_pl_gz6.sh — PL-GZ-6 gate: lexical cut as PURE WIRING (the seed's firstpath/1 law). The
# cut box body is the det four-port shape (α falls to γ; def β; jmp ω) IDENTICAL to a vacuous-success
# unify — the ONLY difference is driver-side: gz_emit_callee wires the cut's ω to the callee fail
# landing cl_ω instead of the backward redo chain. That severs redo past the cut (goals before it
# never receive redo; the clause-advance block is unreachable once the cut executed) while goals
# AFTER the cut redo normally; cut-not-reached (forward failure before the cut) still advances
# clauses — ISO-correct. This rung also re-baselined the m2 oracle: cut β re-entry used to
# RE-SUCCEED (the cut's CP-truncate freed the choice's own CP, which the node-state resume layer
# misread as liveness, and the cut's case re-truncated + re-succeeded on resume re-walks). Fix:
# stateful cut (truncate once per activation), cp_cut_away commit detection in IR_CHOICE redo, and
# cut-aware liveness (only the cut's goal-suffix can offer alternatives) in IR_CHOICE + IR_GOAL.
# GATE-1 / GATE-3 counts are byte-identical to the pre-fix baseline (115/115 · 18/0/97 · 105/0/10).
# Probes: m2 == m3 == m4 BYTE-IDENTICAL on the new path. Negatives: cut at QUERY level refuses
# (dynamic territory — paper §4.5 frame gate, a later rung); cut inside a query soft-disj arm
# refuses (it must sever the ;true soft-fail promotion = dynamic). Both branches refuse identically.
