# same 68 files: the builder REFUSES BY CONTRACT to absorb a source a KEEP.md declares a permanent keeper or a
# PENDING.md defers to a live row, while this census had never heard of either filename and printed all 68 as
# OWED -- debt no instrument would ever have let anyone pay, and a row whose DONE-WHEN is this census's own rc
# could not have gone green by doing the work it named. MEASURED: snocone 79 owed -> 11, the 68 being
# tests/snocone/ladder/prog/*.sc, declared keepers in tests/snocone/ladder/KEEP.md since the tree was built.
# ⭐ THE GENERAL FORM, which outlives the fix: TWO INSTRUMENTS EACH SUCCEEDING ON THEIR OWN TERMS GIVE A

# THIRD copy here would reopen the substring/scope bugs those two paid to fix, and any disagreement between the
# third copy and the other two would be UNATTRIBUTABLE -- you could not tell a real keeper from a drift.
# ⛔ AND A CENSUS THAT CANNOT READ THE DECLARATIONS REFUSES (rc=2). Reporting "declared-keeper 0" because an
