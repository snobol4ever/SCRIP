# test_gate_fb_adopt_one_predicate.sh — ZETA-FB-3 (s161): THE ADOPT CONDITION IS WRITTEN ONCE.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS.  Two prologue shapes establish rbp as the frame base: xa_flat's jmp-entry
# hdr (save caller rbp + seed rbp=rsp), gated emit_jmp_pin_rbp(); and the HEAP-FRAME ADOPT
# (`push rbp; mov rbp,rdi`), which carves no rsp frame because the activation must survive
# beta-resume.  The second arm's condition was spelled as the RAW GLOBAL DISJUNCTION
# `g_gen_proc_active || g_resumable_callable_active` at SEVEN sites (6 in xa_flat.cpp across
# both media + prologue and epilogue, 1 at the emit.cpp beta dispatch) plus once more inside
# emit_rec_pin().  That duplication IS the s158 land-mine class: edit one copy and the store
# and the load name different base registers, which measured 107/164 FAIL + SIGSEGV.
#
# ZETA-FB-2 (s160) unified the CONSUMERS (x86_fb_pinned == emit_rec_pin).  ZETA-FB-3 names the
# PRODUCER -- emit_heap_fb_adopt() in emit.h -- so the union is the disjunction of two NAMED
# arms.  Prose cannot hold that; this gate can.  Per GOAL-PROLOG-BB.md's own closing note: an
# invariant that nothing checks and nobody updates is the defect, not the documentation.
#
# WHAT IT ASSERTS: the raw disjunction appears in CODE at exactly ONE place -- the body of
# emit_heap_fb_adopt().  Comment prose is exempt (provenance comments legitimately quote the
# old spelling); the check strips /* ... */ before matching.  The individual globals are NOT
# banned -- they are set by the driver and read for reporting; only the RE-DERIVED PREDICATE is.
#
# EXIT 0 = one definition site and no re-derivation.  EXIT 1 = a copy came back.
