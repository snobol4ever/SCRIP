# ⭐⭐ DEFECT-C ACCEPTANCE GATE — the vlist_select ladder, graded so a LUCKY DRAW CANNOT PASS IT.
# Row `defect-c-zop-flat-regime-depth-compensate` (hq_P). Written hq_P 2026-08-27 s276.
#
# ⛔⭐ WHY THIS SCRIPT EXISTS AT ALL — THE CRITERION IT REPLACES COULD BE PASSED BY A BUILD THAT FIXED NOTHING.
# The row's DONE-WHEN was PROSE: "all PASS in both modes under at least two process environment sizes".
# Read literally as one run per size, that bar is a COIN FLIP: seat03 found, and hq_P independently
# reproduced on a different tree, that v04_listappend_growth SIGSEGVs under `env -i` at ~27% and NEVER
# ambient (hq_P measured 8/30 minimal, 0/30 ambient; seat03 8/29 minimal, 0/21 ambient). One run per
# environment therefore passes ~73% of the time against a null fix. A criterion that green-lights a
# do-nothing build three times in four is not a weak criterion, it is a VACUOUS one.
#
# ⭐⭐ THE MEASURED CURE, AND IT IS THE PRODUCT OF TWO THINGS, NOT EITHER ONE:
#     bare + ambient   -> 0/30  flagged   (the defect never manifests; a green run here means nothing)
#     bare + `env -i`  -> 8/30  flagged   (~27% -- real, but a coin flip per run)
#     valgrind + ambient -> 0/5 flagged   (⛔ VALGRIND ALONE CATCHES NOTHING -- it exits 0 and is silent)
#     valgrind + `env -i` -> 8/8 flagged  (✅ 100% DETERMINISTIC, with "Invalid write of size 8 ...
#                                          Address ... is not stack'd, malloc'd or (recently) free'd")
# ⛔ So "just run it under valgrind" is NOT the fix -- ambient valgrind is as blind as an ambient bare run.
# The environment is not incidental to this defect: it positions the out-of-bounds write, and only under
# the minimal environment does valgrind's stricter address-space bookkeeping see it every single time.
# THE GATE THEREFORE GRADES `env -i` + valgrind AS THE PRIMARY DETECTOR and keeps N-rep bare sampling as
# an independent backstop, because a cure that merely moved the write would silence one and not the other.
#
# ⛔ REFUSES rc=2 RATHER THAN SKIPPING: no ./scrip, no valgrind, no witness, no .ref => rc=2, never rc=0.
#    A test that cannot measure must never report success (RULES.md; the `make test` .PHONY trap).
# ⛔ EXPECTED TO FAIL TODAY. The cure is NOT landed, so this gate SHOULD exit 1 on the current tree --
#    that is its own negative test, and the reason it was written before the cure rather than after.
