"""util_master_content_diff.py -- compare two master suites by ENTRY IDENTITY AND CONTENT, not by file bytes.

⛔⭐ WHY THIS EXISTS, AND IT IS A REPAIR TO A PROCEDURE I WROTE MYSELF (hq_C, 2026-08-30).
Law 2's cut-over clause says a cut-over language re-verifies a guard change by BUILDING INTO A SCRATCH TREE
AND DIFFING, never by deleting in place. I landed that procedure in util_build_master_suite.py's header.
⛔ IT CANNOT BE EXECUTED AS WRITTEN, because a plain `diff` of the two trees is unreadable:

  MEASURED, snobol4, corpus 5a48a5d5 -- scratch rebuild vs the committed master:
      ALL.sno   1438 changed lines      ALL.csv  2632      ALL.xfail  152
  and the CONTENT was IDENTICAL: 1726 entries both sides, 0 lost, 0 gained, 0 bodies differing,
  xfail 77/77 with 76 reasons each.

  THE CAUSE: `seq` is a POSITIONAL index and the rebuild's ordering differs from the committed file's.
  `code_eval_replace_1` sits at seq 1659 in the committed master and seq 987 in the rebuild; 694 of 1726
  entries shift by exactly +1 to accommodate, rewriting their banners and their CSV rows. Banner counts
  are identical (908/908). So `build(read(X))` equals X in CONTENT and differs from X in ORDER.

⭐ THE CONSEQUENCE IS THE POINT: a byte diff of a master is ~3000 lines of pure renumbering, and A REAL
CHANGE IS INVISIBLE INSIDE IT. The procedure asked people to look for a needle in a haystack it generated
itself. hq_P predicted exactly this ("a 3154-line diff that would bury any real change") before the
mechanism was known; this tool is the mechanism plus the cure.

⛔ SO THE DIFF THAT VERIFIES A CUT-OVER REBUILD IS THIS ONE, NOT `diff`. It compares what the grader
actually reads -- names, bodies, refs, stdin, xfail, declared rc -- and IGNORES seq and file order, which
carry no meaning the grader consults. A difference this reports is real; a difference `diff` reports may
be nothing at all.
⚠️ AND THE FIELD LIST IS THE WHOLE CORRECTNESS OF THIS TOOL (batch-8 Law 1, and the round-trip law it
came from): a comparison that omits a field the grader reads is not a comparison. Adding a sidecar means
adding it HERE too, or this silently starts passing on a difference that matters.

EXIT: 0 identical in content · 1 differences found (a real result) · 2 could not measure.
Usage: python3 scripts/util_master_content_diff.py <dirA> <dirB> [--lang snobol4] [--stem ALL]
