# test_gate_progress_flips_a_superseded_undeclared_series_is_not_a_loss.sh -- THE NET MEASURE READS A PROGRAM ACROSS ITS RUNNER'S SWITCH
# FROM AN UNDECLARED CONFIGURATION TO A DECLARED ONE, AND NEVER HIDES A DECLARED DIVERGENCE WHILE DOING IT.
#
# ⛔ THE DEFECT (the ceo's measurement 2026-09-23 17:0x CDT; row instruments-progress-flips-counts-a-program-lost-when-its-runner-began-
# declaring-a-config-and-the-undeclared-series-stopped, the coo). .github/scripts/util_progress_flips.py keys its NET series on (suite,
# program, mode, config) -- rightly, CEO-1047/1050: a shipped PASS must never hide an arena FAIL. But when a runner began DECLARING its
# configuration, the program's undeclared series stopped, and its last reading stayed its verdict forever: over 09-20..09-23 the tool
# listed 37 master programs LOST and every one of the 37 PASSED on its latest published clean reading. The gain count had the mirror
# fault: a series that went red-to-green before the switch read as a gain the program no longer has, and a program red before the
# switch and green after it read as no gain at all.
# THE CURE (one rule): an undeclared series is SUPERSEDED when a declared series of the same (suite, program, mode) has a clean reading
# after its last one; it stops being a position, and every declared series born inside the window after its base INHERITS that base.
# ONLY the series that CONTINUES the undeclared one inherits (CONTINUES_UNDECLARED, `shipped`): the first cut handed the base to every
# declared series born in the window and, on the frozen 4.18M-row snapshot, master LOST went 37 -> 83 -- sixty stress and arena series
# read as losses against an undeclared PASS they never continued. Across configurations a change is a differential, not a flip.
# A declared series is never superseded: one that stopped (a retired arm) stays LOST and says STOPPED beside the program's latest reading.
#
# THE FIXTURE (hermetic: a planted table through --db, a 5 h window; H before it, W1 and W2 inside it):
#   P   undeclared PASS@H FAIL@W1, shipped PASS@W2     -> NOT lost (the ceo's 37)            M1  undeclared FAIL@H, shipped PASS@W2 -> GAINED
#   P2  undeclared PASS@H FAIL@W1, shipped FAIL@W2     -> lost, across the switch            M2  undeclared FAIL@H PASS@W1, shipped FAIL@W2
#   R   undeclared PASS@H FAIL@W1, never switched      -> lost                                    -> NOT gained (the old rule's false gain)
#   S   shipped PASS@H FAIL@W1                         -> lost (declared series untouched)   A   undeclared PASS@H, shipped PASS@W2 and
#   T   SCRIP_HEAP_KB=64 PASS@H FAIL@W1, shipped PASS@W2 -> lost AND STOPPED (an arena FAIL       arena_mb=1 FAIL@W2 -> neither lost nor
#       beside a shipped PASS: the cure may not hide it)                                          gained (a differential; its own base)
# ⭐ FAIL-ONCE IS BUILT IN, AND EVERY RUN: the same arms grade the OLD reader, taken from .github's own history (the parent of the commit
# that introduced the rule, found with `git log -S`), and it must red EXACTLY on the arms the cure changes -- P (it listed P lost),
# T-STOPPED, the superseded count, and M1's gain (it named no gain at all). The other arms are green on the old reader BY CONSTRUCTION
# and are named so nobody reads their green as coverage: P2 R S T lost (the old reader listed them too), M2 not gained (it named no
# gains), and A neither lost nor gained (it never compared across configurations). A gate whose assertions cannot see the defect is a
# gate that reads "there was never a bug here".
