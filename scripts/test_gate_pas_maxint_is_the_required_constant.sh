# test_gate_pas_maxint_is_the_required_constant.sh -- ISO 7185 6.4.2.2, maxint is a required constant-identifier
#
# MEASURED 2026-09-23 by hq_pascal on SCRIP 4755ec672, both modes, row pascal-all-test-suites-of-the-language-read-100-percent-on-the-
# suite-table-the-home-stretch. "The required constant-identifier maxint" (6.4.2.2) was never defined: mk_ident fell through to an
# undeclared variable, so writeln(maxint) printed NOTHING at rc=0, -maxint printed 0, i := maxint stored nothing, and a subrange
# 0..maxint collapsed to 0..0 (scalar_constant's const lookup failed and left 0). No Pascal source in SCRIP's history ever named it.
# Six PAT rejection witnesses use it (1732 1735 1736 1738 1739 1882), which is why their runtime checks cannot land before it.
# The value is fpc -Miso's, 2147483647, so every FPC-suite ref stays comparable. A program that DEFINES maxint keeps its own value:
# the fallback sits after the constant table in both mk_ident and scalar_constant, and Pascal-P4 (const maxint = 32767) relies on it.
# ⛔ NAMED, NOT CURED HERE: the constant table is flat and first-match, so a PROCEDURE-LOCAL const maxint = 100 leaks into the
# program block (measured: the main body then reads 100) -- the same scoping class as every other local constant, its own landing.
# Before landing, every acceptance program in the corpus (PasM, the FPC suite, P4, P5, the benchmarks, 456 programs) was compiled
# with the change: the refused set was identical to the tree before.
#
# ARMS: two legal programs, each cut LIVE from fpc -Miso and required byte-identical in BOTH modes (m4 compiles, links and runs):
# maxint and -maxint in expressions, in constant-definitions, as a subrange bound, in div/mod and assigned to integer, subrange and
# real variables; and a program that redefines maxint at program level, which must use its own value. FAIL_ONCE=1 corrupts the
# first arm's ref to prove the arm can fail.
