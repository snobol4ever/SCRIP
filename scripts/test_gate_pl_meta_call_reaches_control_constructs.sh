# test_gate_pl_meta_call_reaches_control_constructs.sh -- A CONTROL CONSTRUCT REACHED THROUGH A VARIABLE GOAL RUNS.
# THE DEFECT THIS PINS: rt_pl_goal_gen_h (src/runtime/by_name_dispatch.c) resolves a variable goal through
# rt_proc_is_registered, and the proc table holds COMPILED CLAUSE PREDICATES only. A control construct is a
# compile-time lowering rule, never a callable runtime entity, so `X = (p,q), call(X)` raised
# existence_error(procedure, ,/2) while the SOURCE-LITERAL `call((p,q))` was green -- the same goal, green or
# red depending only on whether the compiler could SEE it.
# THE CURE: lower_pl_stage2 synthesises and registers a wrapper proc per control name, reusing the machinery it
# already uses for dynamic predicates. The dispatcher is untouched. ⛔ The wrappers are COMPILER-SYNTHESISED on
# purpose: real swipl refuses the same clauses in user source ("No permission to modify static procedure").
#
# WHAT IT PROVES, in five directions so a naive cure cannot pass it:
#   (a) THE CURE: (p,q), (p;q) and (p->q) reached through a variable all run, both modes.
#   (b) ⭐ IF-THEN-ELSE IS NOT DISJUNCTION. X = (Cond->T;E) must COMMIT: when Cond succeeds the else branch must
#       NOT run, and when Cond fails the THEN branch must not. The naive wrapper ';'(A,B) :- (call(A);call(B))
#       passes arm (a) in full and FAILS here -- it runs E after T fails. This arm is the reason the wrapper
#       dispatches on the shape of A at all.
#   (c) CUT: a cut inside a meta-called goal must run, OR refuse loudly. ⭐ MEASURED: the cut's own pruning
#       re-enters the box, so it hits the SAME rung-10a re-drive gap as (i) -- the cut is not a separate
#       defect, which is exactly what this gate's first version got wrong when it blamed cut transparency.
#   (i) ⛔ THE LIMIT, PINNED RATHER THAN HIDDEN: backtracking INTO a meta-called goal (re-drive) is rung 10a's
#       unbuilt half -- the entry is shareable and correct, the RE-DRIVE wrecks the callee frame. The runtime
#       BOMBs loudly and says so. This arm accepts EITHER the right answer (rung 10a landed) OR the loud
#       refusal, and reds only on a WRONG ANSWER WITH NO BOMB. ⭐ It was written after this gate's first
#       version blamed "the cut escaped the call/1 barrier" for what is actually an unimplemented re-drive --
#       a failure message that names the wrong cause is worse than none, because it sends the next reader
#       into the wrong subsystem.
#   (d) CONTROL: a USER definition of the same name still wins -- synthesis must not shadow the program.
#   (e) The oracle is ASSERTED, never assumed: swipl runs every witness and the gate REFUSES if its answer moved.
# ⛔ Hermetic: every program is written under mktemp; nothing in corpus/ is read or written.
