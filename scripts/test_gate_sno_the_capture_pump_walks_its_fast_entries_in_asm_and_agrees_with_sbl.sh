# THE ROW (the speed row string_pattern, 0.82x SPITBOL in the README of 2026-09-26: rt_dcap_pump was 37-41 percent of its instructions): rt_dcap_pump is the C walk of the pending
# conditional captures at a match's success; its fast arm -- a plain-variable target whose cell the 16-slot cache holds, a slice of the subject, two sxt-owner breaks, one 16-byte
# store -- cost about 134 Ir per capture at -O0. THE CURE: rt_dcap_fast_run (rtx_match.s, Intel syntax, the rtcc four preserved by using callee-saved scratch) runs the leading
# fast entries of the walk -- the same tests in the same order, the same cache arrays (now hidden globals) -- and returns the cursor of the first entry that needs the slow arm, a
# star (deferred) target, an empty capture, a cache miss or a corrupt length; rt_dcap_pump takes that entry itself and calls the leaf again after it. MEASURED: string_pattern
# 293.3 M to 232.0 M Ir (300 reps x 1000 matches x 3 captures; the pump region 134 M to 72 M).
# ARMS (expectations cut from sbl -bf AT RUN TIME): one program of eight capture shapes -- the kernel's three BREAK captures, empty captures, twenty distinct targets (the 16-slot
# cache collides), one variable captured twice in a match, a conditional capture backed out by alternation, a deferred star capture, a capture whose target is its own subject, and
# captures after a heap churn that collects -- in mode 3 and mode 4, plain and under SCRIP_GC_STRESS=1.
# rc=0 clean · rc=1 a divergence · rc=2 REFUSAL.
