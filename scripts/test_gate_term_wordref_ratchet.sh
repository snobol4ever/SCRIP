# scripts/test_gate_term_wordref_ratchet.sh — MASTER-PLAN.md ladder I, rung I5 (minted hq_C 2026-09-01, landed hq_B 2026-09-02).
#
# WHAT IT GATES.  The T slices are migrating Prolog off the `Term *` tree representation onto cells
# (pl_cell / pl_cell_conv).  Each T slice's DONE-WHEN prints the umbrella total, but between two landings
# NOTHING stopped the count from rising again — a migration with no ratchet is a migration that can be
# silently undone one merge at a time.  This gate closes that seam: PER FILE, the count only goes down.
#
# ⭐ WHY A RATCHET IS LEGITIMATE HERE, WHEN test_gate_rbp_census_ratchet.sh RETIRED ITS OWN.
# That gate retired because it counted a property that could never reach zero (a pinned frame's [rbp+N]
# refs are the design working as intended), so it "fired on progress".  Read its FLATDISP-9 header before
# copying this shape anywhere else — the question it forces is: CAN THIS COUNT REACH ZERO BY DESIGN?
# Here it can and is meant to: `Term` is a representation the ladder exists to DELETE, so every remaining
# reference is debt, and 0 is the intended terminal value.  That is the whole difference, and it is the
# only thing that makes a ratchet honest rather than a tripwire on legitimate work.
#
# THE COUNTING METHOD IS NOT A CHOICE — IT IS REPRODUCED FROM THE CENSUS THE ROW WAS MINTED AGAINST.
# The row pinned "the 490 census at SCRIP bcb0ec1e".  Occurrence-counting (`grep -ow`) gives 653 there and
# reproduces NONE of the row's per-file numbers.  MATCHING-LINE counting reproduces all 16 of them exactly
# (unification.c 208 · prolog_parse.c 85 · rt_runtime.c 38 · prolog_lower.c 26 · prolog_builtin.c 24 ·
# prolog_atom.c 17 · resolution.h 12 · term.h 11 · prolog_unify_test.c 10 · pl_cell_conv_test.c 10 ·
# pl_cell_conv.h 10 · prolog_builtin.h 9 · by_name_dispatch.c 8 · prolog_unify.c 6 · resolution.c 4 ·
# prolog_runtime.h 3) and totals 490 over src/ once `*.bak` is excluded.  So: METHOD = `grep -cw Term`,
# SCOPE = src/**, EXCLUDING *.bak.  Verify with the ONE_LINER at the foot of this file; never retype a pin.
# ⛔ A line with two `Term`s counts ONCE.  That is the census's definition, not an approximation of it —
# changing to occurrences would silently re-scale every pin by ~1.33x and invalidate the whole ladder.
#
# ⛔ THE PINS BELOW ARE **NOT** THE ROW'S 490 NUMBERS, DELIBERATELY.  Between the mint (bcb0ec1e) and this
# landing (c6190d9e) the T slices drove the census 490 -> 136: prolog_parse.c 85->0, prolog_lower.c 26->0,
# unification.c 208->56, and prolog_builtin.{c,h} / prolog_unify_test.c / pl_cell_conv_test.c were DELETED
# outright.  Pinning at the row's stale figures would have shipped a gate with 354 refs of slack — green
# while the migration regressed by a factor of three.  The row's own doctrine is "pin-the-property: the
# count only goes down", and "pins are LOWERED in the landing commit of every T slice"; this landing IS
# such a commit, so the pins are the MEASURED census at HEAD.  Routed to hq_C as a FINDING.
#
# ⭐⭐ RE-PIN HISTORY — AND THE FIRST ONE HAPPENED BEFORE THIS GATE HAD EVEN LANDED, WHICH IS THE POINT.
#   490 (bcb0ec1e, the row's mint)  ->  136 (c6190d9e, first pin)  ->  94 (d85035e5, landed pin).
# T9 milestone 7 (8412a1ca) and its follow-up regression fix (be11af20) landed DURING the session that
# wrote this gate.  Neither seat erred; a pin keyed on a tree that other seats are actively lowering is
# stale on arrival BY CONSTRUCTION, exactly as test_gate_optbypass_watermark.sh records for its own pins.
# ⛔ So do not read a stale pin here as a discipline failure, and NEVER 'fix' a TIGHTEN by pinning higher
# than measured — re-measure with the ONE_LINER and lower it.  Slack is the only failure mode that matters
# in a ratchet: a pin above the tree is a gate that is green while the migration walks backwards.
#
# ⭐ THE METHOD IS CROSS-CHECKED AGAINST THE LADDER, NOT JUST AGAINST ITSELF.  8412a1ca's own message
# reports '136 -> 111'; this gate's method measures exactly 111 at that commit, and 94 after be11af20.
# So the slice author and this gate count the SAME THING — worth re-checking whenever a T slice's stated
# delta and this gate's umbrella total disagree, because that disagreement would mean the ladder and its
# ratchet had quietly forked on the definition, and the gate would be measuring a property nobody targets.
#
# ⛔ UNPINNED FILE WITH ANY `Term` REF == FAIL.  Without this the ratchet is trivially dodged by moving a
# refactor into a new file, which is exactly the motion a migration produces.  A new file is not a fresh
# budget; add it below with its measured count ONLY if it is genuinely a step down elsewhere.
#
# HOW TO RE-PIN (manual, never automatic — several seats share this file; RULES.md CONCURRENCY note).
# Run the ONE_LINER, paste the measured table into PINS, and land it IN THE SAME COMMIT as the slice that
# lowered it.  A TIGHTEN hint below is the gate telling you the tree is already better than its pin.
