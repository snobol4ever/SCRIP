# test_gate_zd_a_run_keeps_no_producer_whose_consumer_is_outside_it.sh -- A PLANNED PRODUCER WRITES THE SPINE ONLY, SO A
# CONSUMER OUTSIDE ITS RUN READS A FRAME SLOT NOBODY WROTE (cfo 2026-09-16, the negation row, minted on the CEO-773 row).
#
# MECHANISM, measured with SCRIP_ZD_DIAG=1 and the emitted .s, not inferred: `OUTPUT = SIZE('ab') ~DIFFER('a','a')` lowers
# to LIT 'ab' -> CALL SIZE -> LIT 'a' -> LIT 'a' -> DIFFER, whose gamma (success) fails the statement and whose omega (the
# negation's null) runs LIT '' -> BINOP concat -> ASSIGN. zd_plan (src/emitter/emit.cpp) plans the statement's gamma chain
# as one run (SIZE on the spine, op_zres=1: the CALL template stores its result at [rsp+0] and never its frame slot) and
# then refuses the omega-head run holding the ASSIGN with why="opnd", because a run may only read operands produced
# inside it. The refused ASSIGN is emitted UNPLANNED and reads its operand where an unplanned box reads: the frame slot
# (+64, IR_CALL result, [rsp+64] at depth 0). DIFFER's omega exit unwinds through the operand literals' beta chain and
# pops all 80 bytes to the statement base, so the value is gone and the slot was never written: '' or a garbage
# integer prints where sbl -bf prints the value. A literal on the left survives only because the concat-with-null fold
# re-materialises it inside the omega run; a variable, a builtin call, a user call, a parenthesised concat all lose.
# CURE (planner, never the lowering): after a run is built, no node stays in it whose result is consumed by a node
# outside the run -- the run is CUT before that producer and re-checked until stable (SCRIP_ZD_CONSUMER_CUT=0 restores
# the old plan). xop frame members (the blob rbp channel) are exempt because their reader has a frame home; literals are
# NOT exempt -- with them exempt the unplanned SIZE read its 'ab' from an unwritten frame slot and printed 29059.
#
# ARMS: the row's DONE-WHEN witness (a user-function result concatenated before a negation, two statements) plus eleven
# labelled variants -- builtin call, variable, parenthesised concat, trailing literal, ~IDENT, a literal control, an
# operand-order control -- graded in mode 3 and mode 4 against `sbl -bf`, ref cut at run time. FAIL-ONCE / PASS-ONCE
# 2026-09-16 on one tree, `git stash` around the diff, compiler rebuilt each side (4.4 s): origin db4a6b1fc m3 and m4
# both FAIL (rc=0, 18 differing diff lines = 9 of the 12 printed lines wrong), cure both PASS. Cost ~2 s at load 7.
# INERTNESS on one binary through SCRIP_ZD_CONSUMER_CUT=0 vs =1: 178 loose+csnobol4 programs emit byte-identical .s, and
# the 80-program m3 sample is identical row for row unstressed and at SCRIP_GC_STRESS=30 -- the class is absent from the
# loose corpus (it was found in aisnobol's SNOLISP). Two exemptions, each measured: pattern-family consumers (IR_MATCH_*)
# read the spine through the blob's own channel, and cutting before them turned pos_dyn_inline MATCHED -> NO MATCH;
# literals are NOT exempt, because an unplanned consumer reads a literal's frame slot too (exempting them printed 29059).
