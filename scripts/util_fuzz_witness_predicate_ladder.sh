# util_fuzz_witness_predicate_ladder.sh — for each probe/fuzz witness x mode, find the FINEST
# grading predicate under which it is STABLE.  Companion to util_fuzz_witness_stability.sh.
#
# ⛔⭐ WHY THIS EXISTS.  The stability runner answers one question — "is this witness stable under
# (stdout, rc) as a pair?" — and answered it correctly: 5 of 10 pairs are NOT.  That result was then
# read as "5 pairs are unusable", which is a STRONGER claim than the instrument made.  Stability is
# PREDICATE-RELATIVE.  A witness whose stdout is constantly empty while its crash SIGNAL cycles
# 132/133/139 is unusable for grading an output, and perfectly usable for grading "does it crash" —
# which is the question a memory-safety cure actually has to answer.
#
# ⭐ THE GENERAL SHAPE, and it is this row's own disease seen from the other side: the earlier error
# was an instrument answering a NARROWER question than the sentence built on it (stdout-only read as
# "the witness").  This is the mirror — an instrument answering a WIDER question than the sentence
# needs, and being read as a veto.  Both are the same defect: the predicate was left implicit.
# Naming the predicate is the cure in both directions.
#
# THE LADDER, finest to coarsest.  The finest RUNG THAT IS STABLE is what a cure may be graded on;
# anything finer is noise, anything coarser throws away power the witness still has.
#   P1 (stdout, rc)   strictest — the stability runner's predicate
#   P2 stdout only    usable when a cure must change program OUTPUT
#   P3 rc only        usable when a cure must change TERMINATION
#   P4 crashed?       rc==0 vs rc!=0 — the memory-safety question, coarsest useful rung
#   NONE              disagrees even on P4 -> genuinely excluded, and now for a MEASURED reason
#
# ⛔ P4-stable-but-P1-unstable is NOT a weaker result.  For a memory-safety cure it is the RIGHT
# result: the witness reliably crashes today, so "it stopped crashing" is falsifiable on it.
#
# EXIT: 0 = every witness x mode is stable on at least one rung · 1 = at least one is NONE (a real
# result, not an error) · 2 = REFUSE, could not measure.

# ⛔⭐ LOAD IS PART OF THE LABEL OF A TIMING-DEPENDENT NUMBER, EXACTLY AS THE TREE HASH IS — but on

# ⛔ HYPOTHESIS RAISED AND THEN KILLED BY MEASUREMENT, recorded because the next reader will have it
# too: this box is one 16-core machine shared by ~20 seat roots, measured at load 20-27 with several
# concurrent pristine builds, so "rc=124 is just the 8s timeout firing under fleet load" is the
# obvious first theory.  IT IS FALSE HERE.  Wall-clock per run (N=8, 20s ceiling) is BIMODAL with
# NOTHING IN BETWEEN: fz_red_m1b 0.02s x2 vs >=20.0s x6; fz_segv_24 0.02s x4 vs >=20.0s x4.  A
# load-induced timeout artifact would cluster durations AROUND the old 8s boundary; these do not go
# near it.  The hang is a genuine unbounded control-flow divergence, and load is irrelevant to it.
# ⭐ Kept as a comment rather than deleted because the theory is reasonable, cheap to re-derive, and
# the DURATION HISTOGRAM is what refutes it — an rc alone never could, which is the whole point.
