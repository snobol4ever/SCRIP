# 2026-09-25, on the coo's 886-row ask; CEO-700, CEO-1245, CEO-1269; coo, row instruments-container-or-library-splits-into-a-library-
# owed-its-driver-and-a-container-that-is-not-a-program-and-ipl-publishes-its-shipped-population). The retired UNGRADABLE class
# conflated two facts. A LIBRARY (callable code, no entry point) is a program owed its driver: UNGRADED NEEDS_DRIVER, in the
# denominator. A CONTAINER (not a compilation unit on its own) leaves shipped, named in CONTAINERS.tsv with the measurement that
# makes it one. util_container_or_library.py measures; lib_inventory.sh re-derives every CONTAINERS.tsv row before it prints.
#
# FIXTURE ARMS (a scratch Icon package, inventory_line called directly -- no board): (1) a planted library measures LIBRARY and,
# split, reads NEEDS_DRIVER in the denominator; (2) a planted include fragment measures INCLUDED_BY its includer and, split, leaves
# shipped with containers=1 and the includer named; (3) a class-less row refuses; (4) a measurement that does not re-derive
# refuses; (5) a container also declared UNGRADABLE refuses (two answers); (6) a library written as a container refuses; (7) the
# retired class itself refuses. MEASUREMENT ARMS: (8) Prolog -- a loading tester is SCAFFOLDING, a fact file a test names is
# OPENED_BY, a module of rules is a LIBRARY; (9) SNOBOL4 -- an -INCLUDEd file is INCLUDED_BY, two top-level ENDs are MULTI_PROGRAM,
# DEFINEs with no END are a LIBRARY. RUNNER ARMS: (10) Jcon and (11) Arizona on a scratch package holding one program and the
# fragment it $includes -- shipped=1, graded=1, both modes pass, containers=1 on the inventory line. CORPUS ARMS: (12) no sidecar
# under corpus/ carries CONTAINER_OR_LIBRARY in its class column; (13) every corpus CONTAINERS.tsv re-derives; (14) IPL publishes
# the inventory's shipped count, never the graded subset (CEO-1245).
# ⛔ FAILED ONCE (measured at the landing, recorded in its commit): on bbfc21362's parent lib_inventory.sh, arms 2-7 read red.
