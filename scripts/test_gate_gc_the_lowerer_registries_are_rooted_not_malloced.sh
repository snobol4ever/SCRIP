# test_gate_gc_the_lowerer_registries_are_rooted_not_malloced.sh -- THE LOWERER'S TWO FILE-SCOPE REGISTRIES LIVE ON THE
# COLLECTED HEAP AND ARE ROOTED (cfo 2026-09-18, reverting SCRIP f62a33aed in pieces under CEO-840).
#
# The lowerers run at RUN TIME whenever a program compiles with CODE or EVAL, so sno_build_graph executes with
# collections live and every lowerer static is a holder of the unrooted-static-holder class.
#   g_bb_labels (the Byrd-box label registry, an lc_vec) is the holder that made the class visible: a collection
#   compacted the generator procedure table DOWN and rewrote that rooted slot correctly, g_bb_labels.data was NOT
#   relocated because nothing rooted it, and the next lc_vec_push wrote a label entry through the stale pointer INTO
#   the relocated proc table; rt_gc_root_args then read a label-name rodata pointer as nparams and walked 90136
#   entries off the end.
#   g_bb_src (three parallel arrays behind bb_src_note) is the same shape one file down and had never been named.
#
# ⛔⭐ RE-PINNED 2026-09-25 by the cfo on the ceo's CEO-1272 (.github 639a475b): Lon's word of 2026-09-24 (CEO-1244, "Use the
# special compile-time heap, and use alloc/copy/abandon at geometric growth for dynamic arrays and buffers.") supersedes
# CEO-840's reading of these two registries as it did the cv_t bullet. g_bb_labels' lc_vec and g_bb_src's three arrays now
# grow through ct_grow in the compile-time arena, which never moves, so the collector neither owns nor visits their blocks.
# What stays required is the ROOT OF EVERY HEAP POINTER THEY HOLD: arms 1 and 2 now demand the element visits (each label's
# name and landing, each source record's node and text) and REFUSE a visit of the arena block; arm 3 demands ct_grow and
# refuses the collected heap and every C allocator; arm 4 is unchanged. The history below is the record of the old rule.
# ⛔ THE ARM THAT MATTERS IS ARM 3. Both were briefly "cured" by moving them to malloc/calloc/realloc (f62a33aed).
# That is what Lon's FACT RULE forbids and what the ceo's whole-tree sweep measured the cost of -- 8 of 15 collector
# gates red -- because malloc'd memory never moves, so an unrooted holder of it is only ACCIDENTALLY safe. THE CURE
# FOR AN UNROOTED HOLDER IS A ROOT, NEVER A DIFFERENT ALLOCATOR. Arm 3 requires lc_vec_push and bb_src_note to still
# allocate from the collected heap, so this gate cannot be made green by taking the holders out of the collector's
# sight again.
#
# ⛔ WHAT THIS GATE DOES NOT COVER, SAID HERE SO A GREEN IS NOT READ AS MORE THAN IT IS: lp_strdup (lower_common.c)
# is still a C malloc, deliberately. It is a CHOKE POINT -- its results are stored in IR_LIT().sval and in a dozen
# file-scope registries across lower_snobol4.c, none of them rooted -- so converting it before those holders are
# rooted would manufacture the corruption this gate exists to catch, in dozens of places at once. It is the next
# row, not an oversight. The lc_vec instances that are STACK LOCALS in the lowerers are likewise on the collected
# heap with no root; they need F5's HB_WS kind split, because a registry of live vecs would hold dead frame
# addresses and reading one is a conservative root, which the frozen design forbids.
# FAIL-ONCE MEASURED 2026-09-18 on SCRIP b21de13c4 (before the g_bb_src half landed): arm 2 red (bb_src_gc_roots absent)
# and arm 3 red (bb_src_note allocating with realloc), with arms 1 and 4 green -- so the two halves are independently
# measured and neither rides the other's green.

# THIS ARM WAS RED ON ORIGIN FOR DAYS AND THE HOLDERS WERE FINE: it grepped for rt_ws_alloc / rt_ws_realloc, and the
# HB_WS kind with both of those names was DELETED at place D (the cfo, CEO-925) when its sites took typed kinds. The
# three holders moved to the ATOMIC sibling rt_wsb_alloc / rt_wsb_realloc, which is still the COLLECTED heap -- marked,
# relocated, interior never scanned -- and is on util_c_allocator_census.py's ROOTED-HEAP list, the tree's one record of
# which allocators the collector owns. So the gate said "moved off the heap instead of rooted" about a holder that had
# been rooted all along, and every seat's `make test` carried the red. A gate that names an allocator by spelling dies
# at the next retype; this one reads the family and survives it, because the standing rule already makes a landing that
# adds an allocator update that list.
