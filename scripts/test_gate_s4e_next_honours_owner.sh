# test_gate_s4e_next_honours_owner.sh -- `next` MUST NOT HAND A SEAT A ROW ANOTHER SEAT OWNS.
# Row picker-skips-a-row-owned-by-another-seat-unless-that-seat-picks (ceo ruling 2026-09-03, on hq_B's case).
#
# THE MEASURED DEFECT: `next` served hq_B the rank-0 row port-exit-value-contract-untagged-rax-forges-dt-fail
# whose QUEUE owner column read hq_P. The picker sorted by rank and read only the STATE column, so ownership
# was advisory AT THE MOMENT OF THE PICK and a rank-0 row tagged to a seat in flight went to whoever typed
# `next` first.
# ⛔ WHY SKIP IS THE RIGHT DEFAULT -- THE COST IS ASYMMETRIC: a wrongly-served row puts TWO seats on one piece
# of work, and because a claim HIDES the row from its owner's own picker, the owner is locked out SILENTLY. A
# wrongly-skipped row costs one `claim` typed deliberately.
#
# WHAT IT PROVES, against a THROWAWAY postoffice (S4E_POST) so the live queue is never read or written:
#   (a) a FREE row owned by ANOTHER seat is NOT served, and the skip is REPORTED, not silent -- a skip nobody
#       can see is indistinguishable from the row not existing, which is the failure this picker keeps having.
#   (b) a FREE row owned by the PICKER is served (else the rule would just be "never serve owned rows").
#   (c) a FREE row with owner `unassigned` is still served -- the common case must not regress.
#   (d) rank still wins among servable rows: the owned rank-0 row is skipped and the rank-1 row is served,
#       proving the skip does not simply stop the scan at the first obstacle.
#   (e) `claim` on the other-seat row STILL WORKS -- the ruling constrains the automatic pick, never the
#       deliberate override, and a gate that did not check this could pass against a picker that made the row
#       unreachable entirely.
