# test_gate_icn_alternation_beyond_32_arms.sh -- an alternation with more than 32 arms delivers every arm's own value (ceo CEO-632).
#
# MEASURED 2026-09-12 on 26bbc4c6f: `every write("s1" | ... | "s34")` printed s32 for arms 33 and 34 in BOTH modes -- a silently
# wrong value -- and inside a co-expression the same arms came out &null (IPL's fileprnt: a 33-way `create "NUL" | ... | " SP"`
# read &null on its 33rd activation and raised error 103 in `&null || "|"`). The emitter's template context carried a fixed
# op_parts_ival[32] that the disjunction box indexes per arm (the fill loop stopped at 32 while op_parts_n said N), and
# lower_alt_impl capped the arm list at 64. Cure: the parts table is growable (emit_parts_reserve, the two writers reserve N),
# and the lowerer sizes its arm list by n. Arms: a 40-way alternation plain and inside a co-expression, both modes, byte-identical
# to icont; FAIL_ONCE=1 corrupts the 33rd line of the captured stream to prove the diff arm trips.
