# scripts/test_gc_stress_suite.sh — the 3-stage GC (MARK/ADJUST/SLIDE) torture matrix.
# Runs corpus/crosscheck/gc/ (one test per collector root family + the exhaustion tortures)
# through BOTH modes at a stress ladder: plain, SCRIP_GC_STRESS=25, =7, =1 (collect every alloc).
# Every cell is oracle-diffed against the SPITBOL-generated .ref.
#
# WHAT plain DOES NOT COVER at the default 512MB heap: natural EXHAUSTION-triggered collection
# (gc_collect_ex(1), the conservative-stack-scan path at the allocation site). To exercise it,
# rebuild with a tiny heap and re-run this script:
#     cd SCRIP && rm -f scrip out/libscrip_rt.so src/runtime/rt/gc_heap.o
#     make -j4 scrip ZCFLAGS="-DZC_HEAP_MB=2" && make libscrip_rt ZCFLAGS="-DZC_HEAP_MB=2"
#     bash scripts/test_gc_stress_suite.sh          # 213/214 then force ~30 regenerations each
# (Remember to rebuild default afterward — ZCFLAGS is not a make prerequisite.)
#
# Gate: every cell PASS. Exit 1 on any FAIL.

# demos (demo_porter): SCRIP_GC_STRESS=1/7 forces collection every 1st/7th alloc, and this witness's 30k-

# 24.1s (suite's own arm, already passing), @ STRESS=7 77.9s CORRECT output (rc=0, byte-identical to
# .ref) under a manual 240s timeout, run 3x at the OLD 60s budget with 100% FAIL(rc=124) every time. 180s
# is >2x the one CONFIRMED worst case (matching the porter finding's own margin convention), enough to
# turn the STRESS=7 cell green. ⛔ STRESS=1 (the suite's most extreme arm) was NOT waited out to
# completion this session -- extrapolating linearly from the STRESS=25->STRESS=7 scaling it plausibly
# needs several more minutes, and a live process check confirmed genuine CPU-bound progress (99.8% CPU,
# not stuck) rather than an infinite loop, but that is evidence pointing the same direction, not a
# confirmed number. STRESS=1 may still FAIL(rc=124) under this budget for these two witnesses -- if so,
