# test_gate_icn_call_site_parity_at_proc_call_open.sh -- SysV call-site parity at rt_proc_call_open{,_det}.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (CEO-458): the Icon generator call site entered rt_proc_call_open_det at rsp 8-mod-16,
# a real ABI violation, because bb_call_proc_staged's N-2 pad kept compensating for a REGION HAND-OFF push
# that N-3 had moved to the OTHER SIDE of the call. A compensating pad outlived the push it compensated for.
# It was latent for weeks and only surfaced when a callee finally reached an aligned SSE store -- a movaps
# inside vsnprintf, reached only when the traced call had an argument to image. A generator with NO argument
# was equally misaligned and passed, which is exactly why a witness-based test could not have caught it.
#
# ⛔ SO THIS GATE MEASURES THE INVARIANT, NOT THE SYMPTOM: rsp % 16 == 0 at EVERY call to
# rt_proc_call_open/rt_proc_call_open_det, in a --compile of each witness, read out of the running process.
# A symptom test (does the tracer crash) goes green the moment any pad happens to re-balance the stack;
# this goes red the moment any pad stops matching its push, which is the class.

# ⛔⭐ THE FOURTH SYNTHETIC WITNESS, AND IT IS THE ONE THAT MAKES THIS GATE HONEST (hq_U, CEO-507).
# The three witnesses below call a generator BY NAME, so every one of them goes through bb_call_proc_staged.
# The surviving face of the alignment class lives in the OTHER door -- bb_call_value -- and its n2_align pad
# needs `flat_gen`, which is a property of the CALL SITE's enclosing procedure, not of the callee.  So a
# by-name witness cannot arm it at any size, and this gate PASSED 5/5 on a tree where the ten lines below
# SIGSEGV in both modes and iconx prints 1 then 2.  ⭐ A GATE WHOSE WITNESSES ALL ENTER BY THE SAME DOOR
# MEASURES THE DOOR, NOT THE INVARIANT: the region cannot tell which door it came through (hq_S's framing),
# which is exactly why exonerating one door tells you nothing about the other.  Measured on 3bbdfc8c7:
# arm B reads rsp%16=0 in FN__h and rsp%16=8 in FN__g here, and 0 everywhere in the three by-name witnesses.

# ⛔⭐ ARM B, THE CALLEE SIDE (hq_U, CEO-483). ARM A ABOVE IS ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE PUSH BLOCK TO SEE THIS
# CLASS, and that is measured, not argued: dropping the N-2 pad SIGSEGVs patchu in both modes while arm A
# stays 2/2 GREEN, because rt_proc_call_open is a CALLER-side call ABOVE the push block and the pad moves
# parity BELOW it, at the jmp into the callee. Arm A is correct and is not weakened; it simply cannot reach
# past the jmp. So this arm measures the other side.
#
# ⛔ AND IT DOES NOT MEASURE rsp AT THE CALLEE'S FIRST INSTRUCTION, which is the obvious thing to write and is
# WRONG: since CEO-483 the generator entry frame is FIVE words and entry rsp is 8-mod-16 ON PURPOSE -- the
# odd word moved across the call into the callee's own carve, which absorbs it. A gate pinned to the entry
# instruction would go red on the very landing that cured the bug. What SysV actually requires, and what the
# crash actually violates, is 0-mod-16 AT A CALL: so this arm breaks on the FIRST call the callee BODY makes
# after its carve. That is the exact instruction the record bug died in (a helper reached from a misaligned
# body, movaps inside vsnprintf), it is true under both the old six-word and the new five-word layout, and it
# goes red the moment any carve stops absorbing the parity its call site hands it.
