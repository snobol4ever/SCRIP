# test_gate_master_suite_builder_contract.sh -- the DONE-WHEN of row master-suite-builder-honours-deferral-contract-and-scopes-absorption (ladder I, rank 1).
#
# ⭐ WHY THIS EXISTS (ceo RULING 2026-09-02 on hq_P's FINDING ff4b0aa2). util_build_master_suite.py is the ONLY tool that converts loose corpus files into a graded master, and it disagrees
# BY CONSTRUCTION with test_gate_suite_conversion_complete.sh, the gate that polices it: the gate ENFORCES the PENDING.md/KEEP.md deferral contract, and the builder contains ZERO references
# to either filename. ⛔ THE GATE POLICES WHAT THE BUILDER CANNOT SEE -- so there is no supported way to convert the files the gate demands without also absorbing files deliberately deferred
# to other seats' LIVE rows. This gate grades the four requirements the ruling named, one named FAIL line each, so a partial cure reads as a partial cure rather than as a red blob.
#
# ⛔⛔ IT RUNS ENTIRELY IN A SCRATCH TREE AND NEVER OPENS THE REAL MASTER FOR WRITING -- that is not caution, it is the only way this gate can exist. The defect under test is that PROBING the
# builder WRITES to shared corpus (`--help` alone rebuilt the SNOBOL4 master: six files, 2335 insertions / 2344 deletions), so a gate that measured in place would corrupt the tree it grades,
# once per run, on every seat. The recipe is the script's OWN documented one (util_build_master_suite.py:31): cp -r corpus/tests/<lang> into a scratch dir, point S4E_HOME at its parent.
# ⭐ The last check re-asserts that the real corpus/tests is byte-clean, so a future refactor that breaks the sandbox is caught HERE rather than by the next seat's confusing dirty tree.
#
# ⛔ REFUSES rc=2 RATHER THAN GRADING A MOVING BASELINE: if corpus/tests is already dirty, "did the builder write?" has no answer, and a gate that cannot measure must not pass what it failed
# to read. ⛔ Do NOT relax a check to make this green -- every FAIL below is reproduced from a measurement, and each names the requirement it grades.

# both into rung36_all entries 41/42, so they stopped being loose absorbable pairs, so the builder's rc=2 became the CORRECT answer -- and an arm asserting
