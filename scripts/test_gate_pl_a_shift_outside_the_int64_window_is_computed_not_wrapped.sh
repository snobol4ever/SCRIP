# test_gate_pl_a_shift_outside_the_int64_window_is_computed_not_wrapped.sh -- PROLOG ISO LADDER (cto, 2026-09-13).
# THE SUBJECT: (<<)/2 and (>>)/2 were implemented for ONE window only -- a shift count in 0..62 with a result that
# fits int64 -- and every input outside that window was wrong in one of THREE ways, all from the same two lines of
# src/runtime/by_name_dispatch.c. The class is NOT "the shifts raise on bignums"; that is the face the Logtalk
# suite happened to show. Named by the property instead -- what does this operator do outside its window -- the
# census is: (1) a bignum operand raises type_error(integer, <bignum>) because pl_big_binop carried no shl/shr
# clause; (2) an int64 pair whose result exceeds int64 SILENTLY WRAPS, so 1 << 64 answered 1; (3) a count outside
# 0..63, negative counts included, evaluated C's undefined shift and returned whatever the hardware's masked
# count produced, so 1 << (-2) answered 4611686018427387904. Face (2) and face (3) have NO witness anywhere in
# the Logtalk unbounded family -- curing only what the suite could see would have shipped a silent wrong answer
# for 1 << 64 with the row marked green.
# ⛔ THE TWO FACES THE SUITE CANNOT SEE ARE WHY ARMS b AND c EXIST, and they are the ones to keep if this gate is
# ever trimmed: a raising operator announces itself and gets a row, a wrapping one is indistinguishable from a
# correct answer at the call site.
# THE ORACLE IS swipl 9 (unbounded integers), and every want_out below is CUT FROM IT, never from our output.
# ⛔ RED BEFORE, MEASURED not predicted, on clean origin 4b65bca4e with this cure stashed AND THE TREE REBUILT
# (these arms execute the binary, so a stash without a rebuild would have graded the cured build), m3 AND m4:
#   arm a printed NOTHING and died at the first goal with error(type_error(integer,123456789012345678901234567890),_G0);
#   arm b printed a(1) b(-9223372036854775808) c(-4611686018427387904) d(-64) where the oracle answers
#     a(18446744073709551616) b(9223372036854775808) c(13835058055282163712) d(-1180591620717411303424);
#   arm c printed a(4611686018427387904) b(0) and then died on the bignum goal;
#   arms d and e were GREEN in that tree; ARM f WAS RED, AND I HAD WRITTEN THAT IT WOULD BE GREEN.
# ⛔⭐ ARM f IS A SUBJECT ARM, NOT A CONTROL, AND ITS FIRST GOAL IS THE REASON THIS GATE IS WORTH READING.
# I classified it as a control from the armchair and the measurement said otherwise. Worse than the
# misclassification is WHY its first goal passed on the uncured tree: (1 << 100) >> 100 answered 1 there too,
# because << wrapped the count to 100-64=36 and >> masked its own count the same way, and THE TWO DEFECTS
# CANCELLED. A round-trip identity is the test everyone reaches for first on a pair of inverse operators, and
# on this defect it is blind in both modes -- it asks whether << and >> AGREE, never whether either is RIGHT.
# Goal a is kept exactly as it was, green in both trees, as the standing demonstration; goals b, c and e are
# what makes arm f discriminate. ⛔ A TEST THAT TWO WRONGS CAN SATISFY IS NOT A WEAK TEST, IT IS AN UNREAD ONE.
# ⛔ WHAT THIS CURE DOES NOT CLAIM, NAMED RATHER THAN LEFT TO BE DISCOVERED: a shift COUNT that is itself a bignum
# (1 << 10000000000000000000000) still raises type_error(integer, <bignum>) where swipl raises resource_error --
# this tree has no resource_error vocabulary at all (grep: zero sites), and inventing one is a policy decision,
# not this bug. A count above 2^20 with a bignum operand declines to the old path for the same reason: the honest
# answer needs a bit-length accessor bignum.c does not export, and returning the sign bit would be a guess that
# is wrong for any operand wider than the count. Both remainders are outside every arm below BY CONSTRUCTION.
