# test_gate_suite_runners_honour_the_tests_declared_memory.sh -- LON'S WORD OF 2026-09-23, MEASURED.
#
# ⛔⭐ THE ROW.  Lon, in-chat to the ceo, verbatim: "Well, each test should have the needed amount of memory in the
# attribute TSV/CSV files." (routed CEO-1167).  Before that word a program whose live set did not fit the shipped
# window was a capacity red and an argument for raising the default for EVERYBODY.  After it, the program DECLARES
# what it needs in its suite's ALL.csv heap_kb column, and the runner exports SCRIP_HEAP_KB FOR THAT PROGRAM ONLY.
#
# ⛔⭐⭐ WHAT THIS GATE REFUSES TO TAKE ON TRUST, AND IT IS THE WHOLE REASON IT EXISTS.  "The runner reads the
# column" is cheap to assert and cheap to believe.  The failure that matters is the SILENT one: a reader that
# returns the default for every entry still produces a green board, because an undeclared program and a program
# whose declaration was dropped run identically.  So arm B does not ask whether the reader ran -- it plants a
# program that CANNOT COMPLETE at the shipped default and CAN at its declared arena, and requires the verdicts to
# differ.  A reader that quietly does nothing fails that arm by construction.  Arm C is its negative control: the
# NEIGHBOUR entry in the same csv, same runner, same loop, must still see the shipped default -- because a reader
# that exports one program's arena over the whole run has not honoured a declaration, it has pinned an arena, which
# is precisely the thing a declaration replaces (util_arena_pin_census.py, CEO-1146).
#
# ⛔⭐ ARM A IS A DRIFT ALARM ON A COPIED CONSTANT.  lib_declared_arena.sh and corpus_suite_harness.py each carry a
# copy of gc_heap.c's GC_HEAP_CAP_KB / GC_HEAP_KB_FLOOR.  A copy of a runtime constant that nothing checks is the
# false-label class this column exists to close, so the #defines are re-read from source here and compared.
#
# ââ­â­ ARM D ENFORCES A RULING, NOT A PREFERENCE: A DECLARATION IS A NUMBER ABOVE THE COMPILED CAP OR IT IS NOT A DECLARATION (ceo CEO-1171, 2026-09-23, ruling on the coo's ask).
# The refusal was asked for rather than assumed -- criterion-writing is not the instruments seat's verb --
# and the answer was that warn-and-pass would mint the false label CEO-1101 exists against. So arm D may
# not be relaxed to a warning by anyone reading this file later; it is law, cited, with its measurement.
# ⛔⭐⭐ ARM D IS THE MEASUREMENT THAT MADE THIS COLUMN HONEST, AND IT IS NOT A STYLE CHECK.  gc_heap.c reads
#     cap_kb = (long)GC_HEAP_CAP_KB; if (cap_kb < kb) cap_kb = kb;
# so SCRIP_HEAP_KB moves the INITIAL WINDOW always and the HARD CAP only once it climbs past 4096.  Measured by the
# coo 2026-09-23 on one binary and one 60000-element Icon witness: 128, 2048 and 4096 all die rc=134 at a cap the
# runtime itself prints as 4096 KB; 4097 moves it to 4100; 8192 completes rc=0.  A cell reading 2048 therefore
# declares NOTHING ABOUT CAPACITY while reading to every consumer exactly like a capacity declaration -- and the
# baton's own guardrail (matched at that arena, NOT matched one step below) is UNPROVABLE for it, because one step
# below carries the same cap and both arms read the same.  Arm D requires that cell to be REFUSED rc=2, not
# silently accepted as a no-op.  Arm D2 requires the runtime to still behave that way, so the day the cap moves
# this gate says so instead of continuing to enforce a rule the runtime no longer has.
#
# ⛔ ARM E IS CEO-1127's EVIDENCE BAR.  Every one of the ten seats grades ENTRIES EXTRACTED STANDALONE.  An
# extracted pair has no sibling ALL.csv, so a declaration that did not travel would mean a program needing 16384 KB
# runs at the shipped 128 in EXACTLY the workflow the fleet cures in, while passing on the board it is published
# from -- two arms disagreeing for a reason neither names.
#
# FAIL_ONCE=1 restores the pre-column world -- all five shell readers (declared_arena_kb, declared_arena_kb_beside,
# declared_stack_kb, declared_stack_kb_beside, declared_memory_table) return nothing for everybody AND the travelling sidecar is not
# written -- and MEASURED 2026-09-23 21:5x (coo, the table arms T and the runner census R added on CEO-1229) it reds exactly fourteen
# arms: B, C3, D1, D1b, E2, H1, H2, S1, S3, S6, T1, T2, T3 and T5 -- RE-MEASURED 2026-09-25 on the CEO-1261 cut, the same fourteen of 35.
# The other twenty-one are green BY CONSTRUCTION under the mutant and are named so nobody reads their green as coverage: A1..A4, A3b, D2 and S4 read the runtime, F reads the shipped tree, E1 names a path,
# C1/C2/H3/S2 describe the reader-off world itself, G, S5 and O1-O4 drive the Python harness, which the mutant leaves alone (arm O's
# own fail-once is measured against a harness without the OOM verdict and recorded at the arm), T4 refuses a
# run that has no table (no reader involved), and R is a census of the runners' source -- its own fail-once is a scratch tree
# holding origin's unwired PAT runner and logtalk grader, where R reds naming exactly those two files and nothing else.
# An arm that has never been seen to fail is an arm that reads "there was never a bug here" (this gate's own law,
# COO-152), and a fail-once that reds for a STAGING reason while claiming to have proved the property is the shape
# COO-153 found three of inside the mechanism built to disprove exactly that -- so the ten are listed, not counted.
# ⛔⭐⭐⭐ RE-CUT 2026-09-25 FOR CEO-1261 (Lon, in-chat to the ceo, verbatim: "Let's set our default stack size and heap size for SCRIP to
# be the same as SPITBOL." and "Ensure that all the test suite programs have the stack size and heap size setting placed into the per-
# program attribute files."). The shipped cap is SPITBOL's -d128m and the stack SPITBOL's -s4m, every program declares both, and a
# heap_kb is the program's MAXIMUM heap (-d; exported as SCRIP_HEAP_CAP_KB), never its window. So the fixture is INVERTED: hungry.icn
# (a 6.4 MB live set) DECLARES 4096 KB, which it cannot fit -- an honoured declaration makes it end in the runtime's out-of-memory
# report naming the 4096 KB cap, while a reader that silently did nothing lets it complete at the 128 MB default, and the arms still
# require the two verdicts to differ. CEO-1171's refusal of a cell at or below the shipped cap (arm D) and the stack floor rule (S3/S4)
# are RETIRED with it: a declaration equal to or below the default is a setting; a heap cell below the 1024 KB window and a stack cell
# below 64 KB are what is refused. The pre-cut file is kept whole in history (SCRIP b547d2ea3); its arms are re-derived, not weakened.

# ── the fixture: a program that does NOT fit the shipped cap, and a neighbour that does ────────────────────────
mkdir -p "$T/pkg"
# ⛔⭐⭐ FEW BIG BLOCKS, NOT MANY SMALL ONES, AND THE FIRST CUT OF THIS GATE GOT IT WRONG IN A WAY THAT COST
# A `done` RUN. The first fixture was 60000 small strings. MEASURED: at the shipped default that does not
# abort quickly -- it THRASHES, because a 128 KB window growing toward the 4096 KB cap collects on almost
# every allocation, and the cost grows superlinearly with the count (8000 entries 1.4s, 15000 4.6s, 25000
# 17.3s, all rc=0; only at 60000 does it finally abort, after ~90s). Four such runs under load 28 blew the
# criterion's own `timeout 300` and the gate returned rc=124. ⛔ AND THE REAL DEFECT WAS NOT THE DURATION:
# the premise arm tested `rc != 0`, so rc=124 (THE TIMEOUT FIRING) read as "the fixture does not fit" --
# a loaded box would have been recorded as a capacity measurement. That is the timeout-and-crash-in-one-
# branch shape the coo cured in this same seat's stack gate one tick earlier (COO-152), reappearing in a
# file written the day after. 200 blocks of 32 KB carry the same 6400 KB live set with ~200 allocations
# instead of 60000: it aborts rc=134 in ~1.5s at the default and completes rc=0 in ~75ms at 16384 KB, so
# the two verdicts are far apart, unambiguous, and cheap enough to sit in the blocking set.
# ⛔ FIX_N IS THE SINGLE SOURCE FOR BOTH THE FIXTURE AND THE STRING ARM G GRADES AGAINST. They were two
# literals for one run of this gate and arm G promptly read FAIL when the fixture was resized -- a gate
# grading its own witness against the PREVIOUS witness's output, which is a red that says nothing about
# the subject. One name, expanded into both.

# ── arm H: a STANDALONE program (a benchmark) declares through the <stem>.heap sidecar beside it ───────────────

# the harness's own sidecar through declared_arena_kb_beside, which CALLS heap_declarations(). H1 requires the verdict to DIFFER
# across the declaration, as B does; H2 requires a bare number to be REFUSED, because the harness reads `16384` with no name as
# an absent declaration and a runner would then grade the program at the shipped default while the file claimed otherwise.

# one past the shipped cap each read OOM in m3 AND m4, the progress row naming the cap the runtime reported -- the declared heap for
# the first, the shipped cap for the second; O2 THE NEGATIVE CONTROL, an rc=1 wrong answer with no report reads FAIL, and the entry
# that fits its declaration reads PASS -- a classifier that called every rc=1 an OOM, or that ate the declaration, reds here;
# O3 the SUITE_BOARD line keeps each OOM INSIDE <m>_fail and prints <m>_fail_oom beside it (the boards that read that line take
# fail+crash as their red, so an OOM folded out of fail would read green to each of them); O4 OOM_PROGRAMS names each with its cap.
# ⛔ One-line programs: SCRIP's Icon parser refuses a statement that begins a new line after `L := list()` where icont accepts it
