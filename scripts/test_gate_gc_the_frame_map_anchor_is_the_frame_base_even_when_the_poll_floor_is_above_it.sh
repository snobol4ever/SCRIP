# MODE DECTET; row gc-a-site-that-refuses-every-poll-form-names-an-unrooted-holder-starting-with-the-concat-slot-capture

#
# WHAT WAS THERE. gc_walk_range found a frame's DT_MAP cell, computed the frame's base as cell - map_off, and then
# CLAMPED that base up to the poll's floor whenever the floor sat above it -- which is every poll taken while the
# spine is shallower than the map's declared extent. The clamped value was handed to gc_walk_interior as the ANCHOR,
# so every layout offset in the frame was applied from the return-address slot instead of the frame base: the first
# DESCR entry read the poll site's return address as a tag (the [GC-WALK-BADTAG] lines carried the site's low byte
# in v and the ZRES tag word in p), every cell in the frame was read eight bytes out of phase, and the fresh concat
# result sitting in the ZRES cell right above the return address was never visited and was reclaimed under the poll.
# Measured under gdb on hb_concat_slot_capture_across_a_collection.sc at stress 1: collections 4..12 walked the cell
# (base eight bytes above the floor), collections 13 onward did not (base clamped to the floor), and exactly those
# results came back as runs of 0xDB. That is why the site "refused every poll form": no poll form can root a cell the
# walk reads at the wrong address. The same defect segfaulted Arizona mindfa and ilib in mode 4 at the tiny arena.
#
# THE CURE (gc_heap.c). The anchor stays the true base; only the SPINE word walk starts at max(base, floor); and a
# layout entry clipped at the floor is clipped on its own 16-byte cell grid, never to the floor itself, because the
# floor is a return-address slot and always sits one word below the first live cell.
#
# ARMS. (1) BAND+PHASE: the concat witness matches its oracle-cut ref at stress 1 and 5 at the mandatory tiny arena
# with SCRIP_GC_MAPS=3, and every [GC-WALK] pop=cstack line reads i_phase=0 -- i_phase counts a bad-tag cell whose
# pointer word is itself a known tag, the signature of a cell read out of phase. (2) EXERCISE: at least one of those
# collections reads s_words=0, i.e. the poll's floor was at or above the frame's declared base -- the shape this gate
# exists for; a band that never reached it measured a configuration, not the defect. (3) MODE 4: the recursive
# marklists witness (Arizona mindfa, ref cut from the Icon distribution's .std) compiles, links and matches its ref
# at the tiny arena with collections>0 -- on origin 90392846a it dies rc=139 in the walk.
