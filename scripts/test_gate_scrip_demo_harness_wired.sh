# so its 8/10 FAIL (2026-08-27: 3 SEGFAULT + 5 Icon-semicolon-parse-error, see the two sibling
# rows this same pass minted) has never been visible to anyone who didn't think to run it by
# hand. This gate requires BOTH that it's wired into some real aggregator AND that it passes --
# satisfy the latter via the sibling rows' fixes, or by excluding a still-broken demo here with
# a documented reason (matching this audit's own GATED/UNGATED-with-a-row/EXCLUDED-with-a-reason
