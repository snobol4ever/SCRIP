# test_gate_icn_augmented_scan_over_an_alternation.sh -- `every (a | b) ?:= e` evaluates its lvalue ONCE per variable (ceo CEO-633).
#
# MEASURED 2026-09-12 on 4faf4ed6b: `every text | comments ?:= { move(1); tab(0) }` (IPL procs/adlutils.icn nextadd, the
# idiom that strips a leading newline from two variables) left text "" and comments "" in BOTH modes where icont leaves "abc"
# and "" -- adllist printed blank names, adlsort nothing, adlcheck no address blocks. The lowerer rewrote `LV ?:= RHS` as
# `LV := (LV ? RHS)`, lowering an alternation lvalue TWICE into two independent generators, so the scanned subject and the
# assigned variable drifted apart. `+:=` and `||:=` over the same alternation were right (they dereference the one lowered
# lvalue). Cure: a non-variable augmented scan lowers the lvalue once (lower_lvalue_var) and scans over its dereference
# (lower_scan_impl, the scan case refactored to accept either a subject subtree or an lvalue). Arms: nine shapes -- the
# adlutils idiom, a plain variable, tab(0) over an alternation, a conjunction body, +:=, ||:=, := over an alternation, and
# two more scan forms -- byte-identical to icont in both modes. FAIL_ONCE=1 corrupts the A line to prove the diff arm trips.
