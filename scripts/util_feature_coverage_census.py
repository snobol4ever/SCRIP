"""util_feature_coverage_census.py -- ONE instrument, all seven languages, over the feature columns
every corpus/tests/<lang>/ALL.csv already carries (GOAL-TEST-SUITE-CONSISTENCY.md sec THE STANDARD,
point 8; Lon 2026-09-04, verbatim: "Will all languages get a full test suite with 100's of test cases
exercising each feature and several combination of features?"). Task
feature-coverage-census-hundreds-per-feature-and-combinations-all-seven (ceo, minted 2026-09-04) --
"this row owns the instrument and the floor table, not the witnesses": it prints, per language,
entries-per-feature and entries-per-feature-PAIR, names every feature below its floor and every
feature with no pair at all, and rewrites its row on the leaderboard. It does NOT write test cases --
that is each lane's own walk.

THE SCHEMA: corpus/tests/<lang>/ALL.csv carries a fixed 8-column prefix (rank, entry, origin, family,
kind, xfail, n_lines, modes) -- verified identical across all seven languages before a line of this was
written -- followed by one 0/1 column per feature (snobol4/snocone/rebus 39, icon 61, prolog 39, raku
39, pascal 50; measured against the real trees, matches GOAL-TEST-SUITE-CONSISTENCY.md's own count).
A cell is boolean presence, not a count (measured max cell value across the whole snobol4 master is 1).

⛔⭐ A FEATURE COLUMN NEVER FILLED IS A REFUSAL (rc=2), NOT A ZERO (GOAL, verbatim). Same vacuity-trap
family as util_ladder_forms_check.py's own headline risk: a language whose ALL.csv carries the column
in name only would otherwise read as "0 entries, 0 pairs" for every one of its features and pass
right past the exact gap this instrument exists to name. So: zero entries for a DECLARED feature column
REFUSES for that language rather than reporting a real-looking zero.

THE FLOOR: GOAL text names it "set from the reference's own list of forms (a construct with three
spellings owes at least those three single-feature witnesses)" -- i.e. genuine per-construct linguistic
research, language by language, feature by feature. That research is NOT done here (it is real work,
not a number this script can honestly manufacture) -- the floor table this row owns is the MECHANISM
(a per-language override file, `corpus/tests/<lang>/config/FEATURE_FLOORS.tsv`, feature<TAB>floor) plus
a documented, explicitly-labelled DEFAULT of 10, which is not arbitrary: it is the exact line the GOAL
text's own worked example draws for SNOBOL4, the model shape ("2 below 10: APPLY 8, ABORT 7"). A lane
that has done the real research for its language drops a FEATURE_FLOORS.tsv in and this instrument
honours it, named explicitly in the output as an override, never silently blended with the default.

ENTRIES PER FEATURE PAIR: for every unordered pair of feature columns, the number of entries with BOTH
nonzero -- computed as a full co-occurrence matrix (cheap: each entry has few features truthy at once,
measured max concurrent features per SNOBOL4 entry is small). Reported as: entries with >=2 features (a
per-language denominator, calibrated against SNOBOL4's own documented 1258), how many of the possible
pairs are realized at least once, and -- the actual DONE-WHEN-relevant list -- every feature that is
filled (>0 entries) but realizes ZERO pairs: exercised only ever in isolation, never in combination.

EXIT: 0 every requested language is fully populated (no refusal, nothing below floor, no zero-pair
feature). 1 something is short (a real, printed gap -- expected on every language but SNOBOL4 today,
since filling it is each lane's walk, not this row's). 2 REFUSED -- cannot measure (no ALL.csv, no
feature columns, or a declared feature column with zero entries).
