# (row raku-every-suite-to-100-under-nonet-ceo-1266; found by classifying the Roast files that do not compile: the placeholder `^a` is the second most common unassigned-variable refusal, 11 files, e.g. integration/advent2013-day23.t, S32-list/reduce.t, S06-signature/multi-invocant.t, S32-array/splice.t).
#
# THE DEFECTS, each measured against Rakudo: (1) a caret placeholder worked in an anonymous block (`{ $^a + 1 }`) and in `.map: { $^a }` but NOT in a named sub or `my sub` whose body has no signature: `sub meow { $^a }; say meow(5)`, `sub cat2 { $^b ~ $^a }` were refused by the native emitter
# ("variable '^a' is read but never assigned"); (2) nor in a `for` body (`for 1, 2 { say $^a }`, `for 1, 2, 3, 4 { say $^a + $^b }` must step two at a time); (3) a COMMA LIST WITHOUT PARENTHESES as a routine's last statement or as the operand of return kept only its FIRST ITEM: `sub g { 1, 2 }; say g()` printed 1 (Rakudo (1 2)),
# `sub g { return 1, 2 }` printed 1, `sub g($a) { $a, $a + 1 }; say g(3)` printed 3 ((3 4)), `my $f = { 1, 2 }; $f()` printed 1, `sub pair { $^a, $^b }` returned $^a; the same loss hit every plain statement `a(), b();` (the second call never ran);
# (4) the function form of sort with a LEADING BLOCK was broken for every comparator: `sort { $^a <=> $^b }, @v` was refused, `sort { $_ }, @v` died "error 22: undefined function called" (the block was lowered as a bare comparator expression), though `@v.sort: { ... }` worked.
# THE CURE: (lower_raku.c rk_sub_placeholders, a pass before rk_ph_alias) a sub with no parameters whose body reads `$^x` placeholders gets them as its parameters in alphabetical order, a later plain `$a` naming the placeholder is renamed, and rk_scan_implicit_params stops at a nested sub as it already stopped at a nested block;
# (rk_tree.c rkb_for) a for body with no signature that reads placeholders takes them as the loop parameters (rk_collect_ph, rk_ph_ren), so the existing multi-variable loop steps through the list; (rk_tree.c rkb_call return, stmt_tail, stmt_plain) a statement or return whose list has more than one item builds the whole list (rkb_paren), as `take` already did;
# (rk_tree.c rkb_call sort) `sort BLOCK, LIST` is built as `LIST.sort(BLOCK)`, the method form that works, for a plain or pointy block.
# NOT HERE (own rows, measured): an n-ary reduce block (`@a.reduce: { $^a + $^b * $^c }` takes three at a time in Rakudo: 7, SCRIP answers 1); `fail "msg"` and `die "a", "b"` still keep nothing / only the first argument; a placeholder in an `if` block or a method body; Rakudo REFUSES `$^a` in a statement-modifier `for` (SCRIP does not); `sort { $a <=> $b }` with the undeclared sort globals (Rakudo refuses it too).
#
# THE WITNESS, graded in m3 (--run) and m4 (--compile + link) against a ref cut by Rakudo (/usr/bin/raku), then under SCRIP_GC_STRESS 1 3 5 in both modes.
# FAILED ONCE, measured on SCRIP 560a2bf11 before the cure: every witness-mode pair red.
#
# EXIT: 0 every witness matches in both modes; 1 a mismatch or a crash on a witness; 2 REFUSED (stale binary, no gcc).
