# ⭐ WITNESS GATE for row snobol4-define-alternate-entry-binds-one-entry-for-the-whole-program (hq_P).
#
# DEFINE is an EXECUTABLE statement: each execution binds the entry point.  We bind once at compile time, so
# the LAST DEFINE in program TEXT wins for every call, in both modes.  This gate is the smallest witness that
# says so out loud, and it exists because the row was rank 0 and FREE with a mint-placeholder DONE-WHEN --
# whoever took it would have spent the sitting rediscovering a repro.
#
# ⛔ WHY NOT GRADE COPYL_driver INSTEAD.  The Gimpel driver that leads here fails as `ERROR 246 -- stack
# overflow`, because its two-entry re-DEFINE makes COPYL re-enter its own outer body forever.  A stack
# overflow NAMES NO CAUSE and invites a stack-depth hunt.  This witness prints the WRONG ENTRY directly, with
# no recursion, no list structure and no include -- an unambiguous oracle diff instead of a crash to bisect.
#
# ⛔ THE ORACLE IS RUN LIVE, NEVER PINNED, and a missing or unexpected oracle REFUSES rc=2 rather than
# grading -- a missing oracle does not blank a board, it prints a full, plausible, entirely false table.
#
# Exit: 0 = both modes match the oracle.  1 = the defect is present.  2 = REFUSED, could not measure.
