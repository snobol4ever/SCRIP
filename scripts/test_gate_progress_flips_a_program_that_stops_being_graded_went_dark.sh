# test_gate_progress_flips_a_program_that_stops_being_graded_went_dark.sh -- a PASS that becomes DEFERRED or UNGRADABLE is a program
# that WENT DARK, printed on its own line and named. It is never "lost" (it is not red) and never "reclassified, not a loss" (the
# measurement is gone). PASS -> OUTSIDE stays the one reclassification (ceo CEO-806).
#
# THE MEASUREMENT THAT PUT THIS HERE (coo 2026-09-25, ceo CEO-1270): X64T's math_diff, math_div, math_prod and math_sum were m4 PASS
# on 55f6339b9 (09-24) and m4 DEFERRED on 04549eb5c (09-25), when the statement switch took their asm from 101.5 MB to 169.6 MB, past
# the runner's 128 MB budget. util_progress_flips.py read "lost since the base: package 0" and "reclassified (PASS -> OUTSIDE/UNGRADABLE/
# UNGRADED/DEFERRED, not a loss): package 4" -- four correct programs the runner stopped grading, reported as nothing lost. CEO-806
# ruled only PASS -> OUTSIDE a reclassification; the wider set had no ruling behind it.
#
# ARMS on a planted table read through --db (HERMETIC: never the live database):
#   D  PASS -> DEFERRED      went dark, named with its mode and outcome; not lost; not reclassified
#   U  PASS -> UNGRADABLE    went dark, the same three
#   O  PASS -> OUTSIDE       reclassified; not lost; not dark
#   F  PASS -> FAIL          lost; not dark
#   G  PASS -> UNGRADED      no line at all: UNGRADED is NOT_A_READING, so the last real reading (PASS) stands
#   count                    the NET line reads went DARK: master 2
# ⭐ FAIL-ONCE IS BUILT IN, EVERY RUN: the same arms grade the reader at the parent of the commit that introduced "went DARK" (found
# with `git log -S` in .github's own history). It must red on exactly the arms the cure changed -- D_dark, D_not_reclassified,
# U_dark, U_not_reclassified and count_2 -- and stay green on the rest by construction (O F G, and D/U not lost, which the old reader
# also read correctly).
