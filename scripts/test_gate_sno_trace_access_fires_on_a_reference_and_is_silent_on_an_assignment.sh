# ⭐ WITNESS GATE for rung22 of row snobol4-ladder-every-feature-in-isolation-with-variations (cfo 2026-09-13).
# The SPITBOL manual's 'A'/'ACCESS' entry (Ch10 p.147) is "Produces a trace every time the named item is
# referenced.  If you say X = N, that does not change the value of N, but it is a reference -- an 'access' to N",
# and Ch19 p.244 adds that SNOBOL4 has no access trace at all, so the ORACLE is the only reference for it.
# Measured on d1c122fd7 in BOTH modes: SCRIP printed NO access banner anywhere and never decremented &TRACE.
# ⛔ WHAT THIS GATE DOES *NOT* COVER, AND WHY THE ARMS ALL READ THROUGH $(): a plain read of a global is the
# g_gva_active fast path in bb_var_global, two movs straight out of the GVA slot with NO call to hook, so the
# read-tap in NV_GET_fn cannot see it.  Tapping that path is a shared-node change (bb_var_global serves every
# language) and is an ASK, not this row's landing -- so the manual's own X = N example is still red today and
# is NOT asserted here.  Every arm below is a reference that genuinely reaches NV_GET_fn.
# ⛔ ARM 'silent' IS A CONTROL: an assignment is not an access, and it was already correct before the cure
# (nothing fired at all), so it is the arm that moves first if the tap is ever hung on the store path by mistake.
