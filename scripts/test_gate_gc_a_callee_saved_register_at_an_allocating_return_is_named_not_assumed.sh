# -- F1 RUNG 3, THE REGISTERS (cto 2026-09-18, the ceo's row (1) of CEO-845; row
# gc-frame-placement-proof-...-and-callee-saved-registers-are-mapped; design
# .github/ARCH-GC-COMPILE-TIME-FRAME-MAPS.md sections 6.3 and 6.5 and section 7 F1; law RULES.md FACT RULE
# THE COLLECTOR GUESSES NOTHING, CEO-812).
#
# ⛔ WHY THIS GATE IS NOT THE ROW AS IT WAS HANDED TO ME, AND THE DISAGREEMENT IS THE POINT. The row says "the map
# must carry the pointer-bearing callee-saved registers -- gc_frame_map_t has one reserved quad and nothing reads
# it", which is section 7 F1's wording. Section 6.5 of the SAME frozen page says the opposite in as many words:
# "NO REGISTER MASK: the callee-saved registers are made visible at the poll itself, not in a map", with a spill
# record of tagged cells below RSP. I wrote both, on the same day, and neither was held by a check -- which is the
# fourth time in two days that a fact in this area turned out to be living in a paragraph. So this gate does not
# pick a side by argument. IT MEASURES THE ONE THING THAT DECIDES IT, and the measurement is unambiguous:
#   A REGISTER'S CONTENT AT AN ALLOCATING RETURN IS A PROPERTY OF THE SITE, NOT OF THE GRAPH.
# Two facts, both read off the emitted code by util_gc_callee_saved_census.py and both printed by arm 6:
#   (a) SITE-DEPENDENCE. There are graphs in which the same register is live across one allocating return and dead
#       across another. Section 6.3's map is ONE PER GRAPH. A per-graph mask would therefore have to be the union
#       over that graph's sites, and at the site where the register is dead the union tells the collector to visit
#       a register holding whatever the last box left in it. That is a GUESS, in the one place Lon's rule forbids
#       guessing, and it is worse than no mask at all -- a missing root loses an object, a spurious root reads an
#       arbitrary word as a pointer.
#   (b) PASS-THROUGH. At most allocating returns most callee-saved registers were never written by the graph at
#       all: the value belongs to an ANCESTOR frame, still sitting in the register because nothing here touched it.
#       No map of THIS graph can name it, because the fact is not this graph's.
# THE RULING THIS GATE HOLDS: the register facts do NOT go in the map, section 6.5 stands, section 7 F1's clause
# is the stale one, and the map's fourth quad carries a FRAME fact only (map_off since CTO-88, ARCH-GC 6.2h; it was
# the zero `reserved` quad before) -- arm 6 reds if a register mask is ever
# smuggled into it. What the registers DO need is a tag at the site, which is the spill record, and that is the
# polls row's build, not this one's.
#
# ⭐ AND WHAT THE MEASUREMENT FOUND ON THE WAY, which is worth more than the ruling. Section 6.5 asserts that r13
# holds the subject base and that r14/r15 are the subject CURSOR and LENGTH and therefore raw. The register half
# is confirmed -- r14 and r15 are seeded 32-bit (mov r14d, dword ptr [...]; cmp eax, r15d), and a 32-bit define
# zero-extends, so a 64-bit pointer cannot survive in either. But the ROUTE in that paragraph is wrong: the
# pointer does not reach an allocating return through the seeding `mov r13, rax` after rt_match_enter -- that one
# is dead across every allocating call in the population. It arrives through a RELOAD out of the frame cell the
# match stashed it in, and through the `push r13  # outer_Σ` that saves the CALLER's subject. A whitelist that
# accepted "it came from a tagged cell" as proof of rawness would have blessed every one of those, because a
# cell's DESCR tag is the truth about the CELL and it does not travel to the register: the collector can relocate
# the block, fix up the cell, and leave the register pointing at the old address. The census therefore refuses to
# call a copy raw, and arm 5 holds the copy count at its measured ceiling so the class cannot grow in silence.
#
# ⛔ THE COPY CEILING HAS BEEN RE-BASED THREE TIMES AND NO MOVE WAS THE CLASS GROWING -- A COUNT IS NOT COMPARABLE
# ACROSS A CHANGE OF ITS CRITERION, and both changes were the population getting honest.
#   83 -> 108 (cto 2026-09-18, section 6.5c): the seven hermetic witnesses carry no DEFERRED pattern, so this gate
#     read heap=0 and had NEVER GRADED ONE INSTANCE of the class it exists to hold; the residual it ratcheted was
#     entirely CELL copies. A deferred-pattern witness joined the population and reads heap=5 -- and reads the same
#     heap=5 on ORIGIN, so it was a two-day population gap and not something a cure made. Arm 2b now reds on heap=0.
#   108 -> 133 (cto 2026-09-18, section 6.5d): the ALLOCATING SET itself was undercounted. Its derivation recorded
#     `call` edges only, and the hand-written asm allocators in rtx_alloc.s reach the carve by a TAIL JUMP, so they
#     and the 99 functions reaching the heap only through them read NON-ALLOCATING. Widening the derivation to
#     inter-function tail jumps took this gate's population from 528 allocating call sites to 582 -- the SAME
#     witnesses, 54 sites that were never graded before. Every one of the 25 new copy readings is at a site that was
#     always allocating and was never counted.
#   133 -> 185 (cto 2026-09-19, row gc-the-blob-frame-interior-...; Lon: no BB is entered from C after the original
#   invocation): the SNOBOL4 match-end pump is BOX-DRIVEN now -- rt_match_end_all (one allocating call per match end,
#   the C pump entering bodies from C) became rt_dcap_end_ok_open + rt_dcap_land_γ + rt_dcap_land_ω (three), the box
#   entering the capture target itself through an indirect jmp. 582 -> 594 sites is exactly +2 per IR_MATCH_END over
#   the witnesses, and the census reads every callee-saved register live across the box's indirect entry (the same
#   upper-bound reading a ret produces), so the SAME copies (r13 = outer subject, r14/r15 cursors, r12 pend, rbx)
#   count at twelve more sites. No new register, no new defining form: arm 3 still reads 0 unclassified.
#
# ARMS (all blocking). (1) SELFTEST: the census's own arms, including its planted ones -- an instrument not shown
# to discriminate has measured nothing. (2) POPULATION: one witness per frontend, all seven, compiled to mode-4
# asm; the census reads a non-zero allocating-call population out of them and prints it. (3) UNCLASSIFIED = 0:
# every owned register live across an allocating return has a defining form the census can name. (4) UNDERSTOOD:
# zero mnemonics the census's def/use model does not know -- an unknown instruction is silently assumed to leave
# the six registers alone, which is the same shape as the hole this whole row is about. (5) COPY RATCHET: the
# named residual, held at its measured ceiling. (6) THE RULING: the map's fourth quad is zero in every emitted map
# in BOTH media and nothing in src/ reads gc_frame_map_t.reserved, and the site-dependence count that justifies
# that is printed beside it. (7) PLANTED: an .s carrying a register defined by an un-whitelisted form, live across
# an allocating call, must make the census RED end to end -- not only inside its own selftest.

#   185 -> 287 (cfo 2026-09-19, row gc-rt-c-c-to-bb-entries-...; the SAME mechanism as the move above, MEASURED ON
#   THREE TREES WITH THE SAME WITNESS SET RATHER THAN REASONED): landing 3 put the COMPUTED-NAME CAPTURE TARGET and
#   the TEN MATCH-TIME PRIMITIVES on the tree's one open/land pair, so the deferred witness's LEN/ANY/SPAN/BREAK/TAB
#   each enter their target through the box's indirect jmp instead of calling one C leaf.  80e3a942e (landing 2):
#   594 sites, not-a-pointer 317, copies 185, heap 6.  f0368fb08 (landing 3): 612 sites, 332, 339, heap 6.
#   41323bc8e (landing 5, the entry glue's record as tagged cells): 612 sites, 372, 287, heap 6.  NO NEW REGISTER
#   AND NO NEW DEFINING FORM -- arm 3 reads 0 unclassified on all three and heap stays 6 -- so the 185 -> 339 half is
#   eighteen more allocating call sites reading the SAME copies (r13 the outer subject, r14/r15 the cursors, r12 the
#   pend, rbx), and the 339 -> 287 half is this seat's cure giving 52 back: the glue's pops became tagged-cell loads
#   and r15 is now reloaded 32-bit, which the census reads as D32, provably not a pointer (that is the 332 -> 372).
#   ⛔ THE CEILING IS RE-MEASURED, NOT RAISED TO FIT: it is the residual the spill record of section 6.5 must carry,
#   and it falls when a site stops keeping a heap pointer in a callee-saved register across an allocating return --
#   never because a count was uncomfortable.  The census's own rule stands: "it came from a tagged cell" is not an
#   argument that a register is raw, it is the argument that the register needs a tag OF ITS OWN at the site.
#   287 -> 289 (cfo 2026-09-19, row gc-rt-c-c-to-bb-entries-...; THE COUNT BECOMING HONEST, NOT THE CLASS GROWING,
#   AND THE INSTRUMENT'S OWN TWO COUNTS DISAGREEING IS HOW IT WAS FOUND): the census composes a class NAME
#   recursively -- a reload out of a slot whose store came from a register that was itself reloaded out of a slot
#   reads CELL:CELL:POP -- and the tally that feeds THIS ceiling peeled ONE `CELL:` prefix, so such a reading left
#   with a tail of CELL:POP, matched no set, and fell to the tally's "unclassified" bucket. The SUMMARY prints
#   unclassified as the length of the unclassified LIST, which such a reading never joins (the census files it in the
#   COPY list), so the two readings -- both r12 at rt_dcap_land_γ/ω in n27_match_end of the SNOBOL4 witness, this
#   seat's own match-end road -- were counted by NEITHER blocking arm: not arm 5's ratchet, not arm 3's zero. The
#   copy LIST held 289 while this ceiling was grading 287 and no arm could say so. Cured at the instrument: bucket()
#   peels every prefix (hoisted to module scope so the selftest grades the REAL rule and not a second copy of it),
#   the census REFUSES rc=2 when the tally and the list disagree, a 14th selftest arm plants a CELL:CELL:POP chain
#   and reds on the one-prefix peel, and the SUMMARY carries bucket_unclassified= so the two counts are visible side
#   by side in the one line the gates parse. NO NEW SITE, NO NEW REGISTER, NO NEW DEFINING FORM: 612 sites, raw 372,
#   heap 6 are unchanged from 41323bc8e -- only the two readings that were always there and were never counted.
#   ⛔ AND THE RESIDUAL IS NOW NAMED BY FILE AND GRAPH in the census report (`COPY <file> total=N: <graph>=n ...`),
#   because a residual nobody can attribute is a residual nobody cures: 166 of the 289 are the deferred-pattern
#   witness's primitive and capture roads, 43 the SNOBOL4 witness, and the rest the ceo's frontends.
