# test_gate_bench_prolog_kernels_pristine.sh -- EVERY PROLOG BENCHMARK KERNEL IS PRISTINE AND HAS A REF
# (CEO-567, RULES.md:321, ARCH-PROGRAM-LEDGER.md; row bench-kernels-are-not-pristine-and-carry-no-refs).
#
# THE RULE: a benchmark kernel's source holds the COMPUTATION AND NOTHING ELSE. The timing bracket and the
# iteration loop are GENERATED around it by scripts/bench_prolog_wrap.sh, and every kernel carries a ref cut
# from the ORACLE so the run that is timed is also graded.
#
# WHY THIS GATE EXISTS -- MEASURED hq_P 2026-09-13, SCRIP 202d8bfff, corpus 7bedb92d0, and the reason it is a
# gate rather than a one-off cleanup:
#   corpus/benchmarks/prolog/bench/ shipped TWO conventions in ONE directory -- 13 pristine result-signature
#   kernels and 10 with a wall_us/wall_ms bracket baked into main/0.  The rival arms consult
#   prelude_gplc.pl / prelude_swipl.pl, which define wall_us/1, so gprolog and swipl kept publishing real
#   numbers for all 23.  ⛔ SCRIP HAS NO PROLOG-REACHABLE WALL CLOCK AT ANY SPELLING, so on the engine
#   actually under measurement each of the ten raised existence_error(wall_us/1), printed NO answer, and
#   EXITED 0.  A sweep counted that as a run.  The defect was therefore invisible from every direction that
#   mattered: the board was full, the rival columns were real, and the SCRIP column was empty for a reason
#   nothing reported.  That is the shape this gate exists to make impossible -- not the ten files, which are
#   already cured, but the SECOND convention silently reappearing beside the first.
#
# ⭐ IT ALSO CAUGHT A REAL RED THE MOMENT IT MADE ONE MEASURABLE: with the bracket gone, tak.pl reaches
#   SCRIP and dies at ERROR 246 stack overflow.  That red is now visible instead of masked; it is a Prolog
#   runtime defect, not a benchmark defect, and it is filed rather than fixed here.

# current has no reason to suspect its corpus is not. A gate that grades a repo it does not live in must say
