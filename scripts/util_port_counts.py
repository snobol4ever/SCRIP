"""util_port_counts.py -- EXACT per-box alpha/beta execution counts, and beta/alpha backtrack pressure.

Lon (2026-08-28, via ceo, slice 4 of perf-symbol-attribution-tooling): "SCRIP can instrument alpha and
beta to produce execution counts." The deliverable named is exact counts beside perf's samples --
alpha-count = executions per box, beta/alpha = backtrack pressure per box, the alternation/defer
hotspots ranked BY FACT rather than by sample.

WHY CALLGRIND AND NOT AN EMITTED COUNTER (the design call, so the next seat does not re-buy it):
every alpha and beta port is ALREADY a symbol in a mode-4 binary (porter: 1,959 alpha + 1,138 beta
local `t` symbols), and callgrind's --dump-instr=yes reports an exact Ir count per instruction
address. The count of the instruction AT an alpha label's address IS the number of times that port
was entered -- exact, deterministic, and reproducible to the instruction. So the counts need
* NO emitted-code change  -- nothing is added to the program being measured;
* NO new global variable   -- there is no counter cell to store anywhere (RULES.md NO-NEW-GLOBALS);
* NO overhead to subtract  -- the measured program is byte-identical to the shipped one.
⭐ That last point is Instrument Law 6 satisfied STRUCTURALLY rather than by apology: the measurement
path (a simulator outside the process) is DISJOINT from the measured path. An emitted `inc` counter
would make the instrument a participant and would owe a measured perturbation beside every number.
⛔ WHAT THIS DOES NOT COVER, stated because a bounded instrument must bound itself (Law 13): this is
MODE-4 ONLY. Mode 3 executes flat-wired blobs in an anonymous sealed slab, so its boxes have no
symbols for callgrind to resolve; slice 3's SCRIP_PERF_MAP names m3 boxes to `perf` but is PER-GRAPH,
not per-box, and callgrind does not read a perf map at all. m3 port counts remain UNBUILT, not broken.

WHY THE COUNT AT AN ALPHA ADDRESS IS UNAMBIGUOUS (measured on porter, not assumed):
alpha addresses are all distinct (1,959 of 1,959), beta addresses are all distinct (1,138 of 1,138),
and alpha INTERSECT beta is EMPTY -- so no alpha count can be contaminated by a beta count. Every
alpha address does coincide with exactly one other label, its own `_bx` box-extent twin, which is the
SAME INSTRUCTION and therefore adds no executions. This script re-checks that property on every run
and REFUSES rather than reporting if it does not hold (a collision would silently merge two boxes).

⛔ beta/alpha IS NOT A SPEED MULTIPLE. RULES.md's FACT RULE reserves `Nx` for reference/ours on the
faster axis; this ratio is a dimensionless pressure -- recedes per proceed on one box -- so it is
printed as `B/A` and never with an `x`, and never with a direction word.

INSTRUMENT LAWS OBSERVED: 2/5 (refuses rc=2 when it cannot measure and never prints the success
shape; extraction anchored on symbol IDENTITY, never on position); 15 (alpha/beta are literal UTF-8
Greek in every emitted label -- an ASCII-only pattern silently misses ~98% of labels and still prints
a plausible table, so every pattern here is applied to str, and the suffix set is spelled in Greek);
6 (measurement path disjoint, above); 13 (the all-clear is scoped to the list actually run, and the
coverage block names it).

    Format care, each point a way this parser could have been silently wrong:
      * `positions: instr line` => every cost line is `<instr> <line> <Ir>`; instr may be absolute
        (0x..), relative (+N/-N) or `*` (same as last), each column tracking its own last value.
      * a `calls=` line carries the CALLEE's position, in its own context -- letting it update the
        caller's instr tracker would mis-attribute every post-call cost line to an address in a
        different function.
      * the cost line immediately AFTER a `calls=` line is the call's INCLUSIVE cost, not the
        instruction's self cost. Adding it would charge a box the entire cost of everything it calls,
        which on a recursive pattern box is a number larger than the whole program.
      * `ob=(id) name` defines a name-compression id; later `ob=(id)` alone REFERENCES it. Ignoring
        the id map makes every object after the first look like "not ours" and yields an empty table.
      * ⛔ `ob=` and `cob=` SHARE ONE object-name namespace. Measured: in porter's profile the id 1 in
        a bare `ob=(1)` is defined 50,000 lines earlier by `cob=(1) ld-linux-x86-64.so.2`. Absorbing
        only `ob=` definitions leaves such an id unresolved -- which happened to be harmless there
        (ld-linux is not ours) and would NOT be harmless for an id that is.
      * ⛔⭐ THE MAIN OBJECT MAY HAVE NO `ob=` LINE AT ALL -- it is the DEFAULT context. Measured: a
        1,000-iteration witness produced a profile whose only `ob=` is libstdc++, every main-object
        cost line sitting in the default context with just `cob=(4) ???` nearby. Requiring an
        explicit `ob=` match therefore dropped 100% of the program's own cost. It surfaced as a
        REFUSAL rather than as a plausible empty table only because refusing is this script's default
        when nothing is attributed -- which is the whole argument for Instrument Law 2.
