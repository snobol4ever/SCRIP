# scripts/test_gate_crosscheck_family_list_autodiscovers.sh -- row corpus-suite-family-list-should-autodiscover.
# test_corpus_snobol4.sh's suite-family list is a hardcoded `for family in ...` literal (SCRIP 1d38f034,
# hq_P s277): a suite .sno/.ref pair that lands on disk but is never added to that list is INVISIBLE to the
# board -- not FAIL, not MISSING, simply never iterated -- which is exactly how 98 entries (19 whole families)
# silently left the SNOBOL4 board on 2026-08-27 while the gate still printed "GATE OK ... MISSING=0".
# This gate CONSTRUCTS that exact condition hermetically (a probe suite pair certain not to be in the
# runner's current list, in an otherwise-empty scratch corpus so every hardcoded name/demo path resolves to
# nothing -- MISSING, not FAIL, and irrelevant to the signal below) and asserts the runner does NOT silently
# ignore the probe: either its printed totals grade it (auto-discovery landed), or its output explicitly
# names it as unregistered/undiscovered (a loud consistency check landed instead). Either cure is acceptable;
# silence is not.
