# ⭐ ROW icon-dump-zeta-segfaults-reading-a-non-string-union-member-as-a-pointer-in-the-zr-guard-arm (minted by hq_icon
# 2026-09-17, rooted with gdb; claimed and cured by the cto, whose rung-0 dump arm it was).  zls_reuse_dump's ZR_GUARD
# line printed the guard box's NAME by reading IR_LIT(guard).sval behind an op BLACKLIST (not straight, not IR_VAR),
# and IR_LIT is a union: IR_COERCE_NUMERIC passes the blacklist with integer data in the union, so gs came back
# 0x101000066 and gs[0] faulted -- 30 of 42 Icon benchmark programs SIGSEGV'd under --dump-zeta on 3afb59316 and the
# 4-line witness below (a binop with a VARIABLE operand; a literal operand does not coerce) reproduced it alone.
# The cure is a POSITIVE test (frame_layout.c zls_op_names_a_string): the call family, IR_MATCH_DEFER, IR_LIT_STRING,
# IR_VAR and IR_VAR_REF carry a string in the union; every other op prints its op name and no sval.
# ⛔ THE CLAIM IS HELD BY INSTRUMENTS: (1) the witness dumps rc=0 and its guard line names IR_COERCE_NUMERIC; (2) every
# Icon benchmark program under corpus/benchmarks/icon dumps with rc != 139; (3) a call guard still prints its NAME
# (micro.icn's IR_CALL_ICON guard, the whitelist keeps what the dump was for); (4) the Prolog and SNOBOL4 witnesses still dump.  zls_dump has one
# caller behind --dump-zeta (scrip.c), so nothing emitted moves and no frontend arm is owed.
# RED-BEFORE on 3afb59316: witness rc=139, 30 of 42 benchmarks rc=139.
# ⛔ REFUSES rc=2 when the benchmark population is empty.
