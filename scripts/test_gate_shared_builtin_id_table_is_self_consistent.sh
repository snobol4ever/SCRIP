# test_gate_shared_builtin_id_table_is_self_consistent.sh -- the builtin-id numbering is an ABI between
# EMITTED CODE and the RUNTIME, and until this gate nothing checked it in either direction.
#
# THE CONTRACT (row shared-the-baked-builtin-id-in-emitted-code-has-no-gate-revalidating-it-against-the-name,
# filed by hq_I on hq_U's request): bid_bake_of() bakes (namelen << 16 | bid) into a mov32 immediate in the
# emitted code -- from TWO byte-identical hand-written copies, src/templates/bb/bb_call.cpp and
# bb_call_fn.cpp -- and try_call_builtin_by_name_bl reads it back as
#   _fnlen = bidlen >> 16 ; _bid = bidlen & 0xFFFF
# taking BOTH fields from the immediate and never consulting fn. A .s artifact baked under one numbering and
# linked against a libscrip_rt.so built under another dispatches A DIFFERENT BUILTIN with no diagnostic.
#
# ⛔ WHAT THIS GATE DOES AND DOES NOT COVER, said plainly so nobody reads it as more than it is. It pins the
# TABLE: every name round-trips through the REAL bid_of to its own id, every stored len equals the real
# strlen, no two names share an id, and the entry count never falls below the floor. It does NOT validate a
# baked immediate against fn at dispatch time -- that check costs exactly what baking saves (g_bid_tab is
# HASH-indexed, not id-indexed, so recovering the name from a bid means the hash lookup the bake exists to
# avoid) and it is named as the open remainder rather than pretended away.
#
# ⛔⛔ THE ENTRY FLOOR IS THE LOAD-BEARING ARM AND HERE IS THE MEASUREMENT BEHIND IT. scripts/gen_builtin_ids.py
# is a SPENT ONE-SHOT MIGRATION, not a regenerator: it harvests !strcmp(fn,"...") sites and REWRITES them into
# (_bid == BID_...) comparisons, so the sites it feeds on are the ones it already consumed. It exits rc=1
# today only because its FUNC_RE anchors on a DECLARATION at column 0 rather than the definition. MEASURED
# 2026-09-11 by hq_U on a scratch copy, with the anchor corrected to the real definition and declarations
# skipped: it runs rc=0 and writes a table of NINE names where the committed one has 188 -- it would delete
# 179 ids and renumber what survived. So "repair the anchor" is the catastrophe and not the cure, and the
# floor below is what turns that from a silent 95% deletion into a red arm.
#
# ⭐ IT USES THE REAL HEADER AND THE REAL bid_of RATHER THAN REIMPLEMENTING THE HASH -- a second copy of the
# djb2 walk in this gate would be a third hand-written copy of the very contract the row is about, and would
# agree with itself while the tree drifted.
