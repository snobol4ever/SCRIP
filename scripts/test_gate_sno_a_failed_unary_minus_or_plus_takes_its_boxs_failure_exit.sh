# SPITBOL'S RULE: an error in an operand fails the statement that raised it. Under SETEXIT the handler is entered;
# under &ERRLIMIT > 0 or inside EVAL (stage stgee) the error is counted and the operation fails. So -ARB raises 10
# (negation operand is not numeric) and +ARB raises 4, and 'abc' ? -ARB ABORT is ERROR 10, never a crash.
# WHAT SCRIP DID (ceo CEO-1434's assigned row snobol4-an-error-raised-in-a-pattern-concatenated-with-abort-crashes-
# scrip-inside-eval, found by the infinite_snobol4 SCRIPtix run at expression 2,358): bb_unop's TT_MNS/TT_PLS box
# called rt_num_neg_sno / rt_num_pos, stored the result and went on to gamma WITHOUT TESTING IT. When the error returned
# (counted, the operation fails) the FAIL descriptor flowed on as a value into the concatenation and the match, which
# jumped into a literal's data word: SIGSEGV in mode 3 (a mapped, non-executable page), SIGILL in mode 4. With no
# SETEXIT armed it crashed since before SETEXIT shape B; with one armed, the old nested handler entry jumped away before
# the failed value was used, and shape B (fc306f22a), which returns from the error and fails the statement, reached it.
# THE CURE: for SNOBOL4 (op_strict == 2) the box tests the stored result after its GC poll and takes omega on FAIL, in
# both of its forms (the zd result slot and the frame slot).
# NOT COVERED, AND WHY: the same statements written with constant operands (X = 'abc' ? -ARB ABORT) are a compile-time
# error in sbl, which folds -ARB while compiling; that is the parser-strictness row. sbl itself segfaults on this EVAL
# inside a program-defined function, so every arm runs at the top level.
#
# Expectations are cut from sbl -bf AT RUN TIME, both modes; every arm grades its whole stdout. rc=0 clean · rc=1 a
# divergence · rc=2 REFUSAL.
