# ⛔⭐ ZERO-GRADED IS A REFUSAL, NOT A PASS (hq_B 2026-08-30, row graders-denominator-audit-six-families).
# MEASURED: every witness this script names lost its per-entry .expected file when the family was
# consolidated, so run() took its `[ -f ... ] || { echo SKIP; return; }` arm for ALL of them, PASS and
# FAIL both stayed 0, and `[ "$FAIL" -eq 0 ]` reported GREEN having graded nothing. That is WORSE than an
# unmatched glob: this script names its witnesses, DETECTS that each is missing, prints SKIP, and counts
# it as neither -- skip-as-success, which RULES.md calls the same defect with better manners.
# ⭐ The denominator was written at the top of this file the whole time (the `# Gate: PASS=n` header) and
# nothing ever compared against it. A declared expectation that no code reads is a comment, not a gate.
# ⛔ THE CONTENT IS NOT LOST AND THIS IS NOT RE-POINTED ON PURPOSE: test_icon_all_rungs.sh /
# test_icon_rung_suite.sh / test_icon_x64_all_rungs.sh already grade these families as SUITE pairs
# (measured: `SUITE rung30_builtins_misc: pass=5`, and so on for 31-35, 33 entries in total). So this
# script is REDUNDANT, not a coverage hole -- unlike the Prolog twins, where no master board over ALL.pl
# existed and the same shape hid 143 real gradings. Re-pointing this at the absorbed data would duplicate
# the aggregate; refusing is the honest state, and whether to retire it outright is a corpus-layout call.
