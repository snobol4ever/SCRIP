# instruments-the-sweep-keeps-a-row-whose-finish-line-refused-on-a-load-guard-instead-of-retiring-it-ceo-1562.
#
# WHAT IT GRADES. The zero-base sweep (.github/scripts/util_queue_zero_base.py --apply, ceo CEO-1386) runs every FREE row's
# DONE-WHEN and RETIRES a row whose finish line reads rc 2 (cannot measure). A benchmark bar reads rc 2 under load by the
# two-number law -- a multiple is not load-invariant (CEO-743): its angles DISAGREE, or its harness prints no row because the
# kernel ran past its budget -- so every sweep that ran while the fleet built retired the live performance rows: eight on
# 2026-10-07 20:16, four on 2026-10-08 15:18, two more at 19:17 (CEO-1572), each re-minted by hand and each a row the fleet
# could not pick meanwhile.
# THE CURE this gate pins: an rc 2 whose output names the LOAD GUARD -- the words "load-guard", which the four bench bars print
# through perf_load_guard (lib_perf_fmt.sh) on a timing-shaped refusal when the box reads at or above BENCH_LOAD_GUARD_PER_CORE
# per core -- is KEPT exactly as a TIMEOUT is kept; its refusal line and the sweep's own load reading go to the baton as a LEDGER
# line that does NOT restart the PARKED-EXPIRED clock (a quiet sweep measures it); the salvage log names the class
# LOAD-GUARD-kept; --help names the rule. A plain rc 2 (no oracle, no binary, a wrong answer) stays CANNOT MEASURE and retires.
# The two refusals differ by one phrase, so both are planted side by side and graded side by side.
# THE FIXTURE is a four-row scratch postoffice (S4E_POSTOFFICE): a load-guard refusal, a plain cannot-measure, a red at rank 0
# (kept, re-ranked to 2, ledgered) and a green (archived). ZB_SCRIPT points the gate at another copy of the sweep for the
# red-once proof: against the pre-cure script (.github f7d92b24) arms H, L, B and S read RED; on the cured one all seven green.
