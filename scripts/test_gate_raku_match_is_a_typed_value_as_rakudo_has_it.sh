# test_gate_raku_match_is_a_typed_value_as_rakudo_has_it.sh -- A MATCH IS A VALUE: ~~ AND m// RETURN IT, $/ HOLDS IT, AND ITS PARTS ARE READ THE WAY RAKUDO READS THEM
# (row raku-every-suite-to-100-under-nonet-ceo-1266, Lon 2026-09-25: "use IPC sync-step monitor to crawl the test suites to 100%"; first-refusal census of the 630 Roast files that still refuse: $/ 41).
#
# THE DEFECT: there was no Match value. `my $m = "abcb" ~~ /(b)(c)/; say $m` printed 1; `$/` was refused by the compile guard ("variable '/' is read but never assigned"); $m.from, .to, .orig,
# $m[0], $m<x>, m:g lists of Match, "$0 and $/" interpolation, .match(/re/) and eq/~ on a Match were all absent. Only the runtime's single g_match fed $0 and $<x> (re_capture, re_named_capture).
# THE CURE: a Match is a typed record Match(orig,from,to,ok,text,positional,named) built from g_match by rk_match_obj_in (by_name_dispatch.c): positional is a DT_A of sub-Match values (a quantified group is a
# nested list of them), named is a DT_T name -> Match or list of Match, from/to count code points, and no field holds a delimiter-joined aggregate (the old grammar-only record kept its captures as a
# tab/newline string). ~~ and m:g return it; `$/` is the provider __rk_pre("/") rebuilding it from g_match (no new global); a condition (if/while/unless/ternary/&&) tests with re_test, which sets g_match and
# builds nothing; .match(/re/ [, :g]) is the same smartmatch node; subscripts [i] and <k> read the positional and named slots; "$0", "$/" and "$<k>" interpolate; a Match stringifies as its text in ~, eq,
# join and the Cool string methods and as its gist (the nested ｢..｣ tree) and .raku through say/.gist/.raku. A grammar's .parse result is the same record with named captures only.
# NOT HERE (own rows): a capture group nested inside another capture group is flat (no .caps tree), .ast/.made, a failed match assigned to a scalar says Nil where Rakudo says (Any), \w is ASCII-only,
# the Map type of .hash, and a SUB's own $/ (the one g_match is the last match anywhere).
#
# THE WITNESSES, each graded in m3 (--run) and m4 (--compile + link) against a ref cut by Rakudo (/usr/bin/raku): value (the fields, gist, .raku, nested and quantified captures, prematch/postmatch,
# code-point offsets), slash ($/ and $0 reads, interpolation, eq, string methods), multi (m:g, .match, join).
# Then the same three witnesses under SCRIP_GC_STRESS 1 3 5, both modes (the Match is built inside one runtime call and every capture, list and table reaches the collector as a typed slot).
# FAILED ONCE, measured on SCRIP 57f4cf251 before the cure: 6 of 6 witness-mode pairs red (value prints (Int) 1 1 Nil; slash and m4 refused at the guard on $/; multi prints Any).
#
# EXIT: 0 every witness matches in both modes; 1 a mismatch or a crash on a witness; 2 REFUSED (stale binary, no gcc).
