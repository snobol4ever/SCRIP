# test_gate_pas_a_value_assigned_through_a_pointer_is_compatible_with_its_domain_type.sh -- ISO 7185 6.8.2.2, 6.4.6, 6.2.2.9: `p^ := v` needs v assignment-compatible with the domain type of p (PAT iso7185prt1820, backwards association).
#
# MEASURED 2026-10-08 by hq_pascal: `var cp: ^char; begin new(cp); cp^ := 1 end` compiled and ran rc 0; fpc -Miso refuses it (Incompatible types: got ShortInt expected Char). pas_value_compat classified only a plain
# variable on the left, so every assignment through a dereference was unchecked. PAT 1820 is that gap: inside a procedure whose type-definition-part reads `type b = ^a; a = char;` the domain of b is the LATER a
# (6.2.2.9, 6.4.1, backwards association), so `cp^ := 1` is an integer given to a char. CURE: pascal.y pas_deref_assign_compat, called beside pas_value_compat for an assignment whose left side is a dereference;
# the domain type's class comes from pas_typename_class (the alias-chain walk pas_var_decl_class already did, now shared) and the right side's from pas_expr_lit_class, plus a TT_ILIT into a char domain,
# which no legal program writes. The alias table answers with the most recent definition of the domain name, which is the later one in the same part -- the backwards association itself.
# SAME LANDING, the same class lookup: writeln(p^) of a char domain printed the ordinal (120 for x) and of a boolean domain printed 1, because pas_is_charexpr and pas_is_boolexpr had no dereference arm; both now ask
# pas_typename_class of the pointer target, and the control prints a char and a boolean through a pointer.
# LIMIT, not graded: a pointer TYPE declared in an outer block whose domain name is redefined in an inner block resolves to the inner definition at the use site; the arms avoid that shape.
#
# ARMS, both modes: four fault programs (a char domain given an integer, the same through a type alias, PAT 1820's backward association, a boolean-valued literal into a char domain) must be REFUSED at compile time
# naming 6.8.2.2 with empty stdout; a control cut LIVE from fpc -Miso (every legal pointee class assigned a legal literal, a record domain, a forward domain defined later in the same part, an outer domain with no
# redefinition) must run byte-identical. FAIL_ONCE=1 corrupts the control's ref.
