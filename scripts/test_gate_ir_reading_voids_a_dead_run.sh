# ⛔⭐ THE RULE: AN Ir READING FROM A RUN THAT DIED IS NOT A MEASUREMENT AND MUST NOT PRINT AS ONE.
# callgrind counts instructions whatever the client does, so a SEGV, a parse error or a timeout kill still
# hands back a well-formed PROGRAM TOTALS -- the count of the dying path, in the same shape as every honest
# cell.  ⭐ A crash that announces itself as a NUMBER is strictly worse than one that announces itself as a
# HOLE (hq_U -> hq_P, 2026-09-10), and hq_U asked that the void become the rule for EVERY Ir cell rather
# than the one board that caught it.  This gate is that rule with teeth.
#
# ⛔ IT DOES NOT REST ON A GREP.  ARM 1 is BEHAVIOURAL: it builds a program that really dies, really runs it
# under the shared reader, and requires the void.  A gate that only grepped for the word `rc` would pass on
# a script that captured the status and ignored it, and would fail on a correct one that spelled it
# differently.  ARM 2 is the census, and it exists only to answer "did a NEW call site skip the lib" -- so
# it names files, never judges shapes.
#
# ARM 1  the reader itself: clean run -> a number; SEGV -> REFUSED(rc=139); timeout -> REFUSED(rc=124);
#        instrument absent -> NOT-MEASURED(...).  All four DISTINGUISHABLE -- crashed is never unmeasured.
# ARM 2  every `valgrind --tool=callgrind` call site in scripts/ either goes through lib_ir_measure.sh or
#        captures the exit status at the call.  A file that does neither is named and the gate FAILS.
#
# EXIT: 0 = both arms pass · 1 = a real violation · 2 = REFUSED, could not measure (never a silent pass).
