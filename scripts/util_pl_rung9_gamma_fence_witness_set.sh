# PROLOG ISO LADDER, RUNG 9 -- THE MEASUREMENT HALF, ordered by CEO-690 after Lon ruled the frame question:
#   Lon 2026-09-13, verbatim: "do a whack-free on GAMMA for a FENCE d (i.e. cut !) or otherwise FENCE d
#   operation."
# The frame STAYS on the machine stack and is torn down sooner: succeed through GAMMA with the operation
# FENCED and BETA is unreachable, so the frame is dead at gamma and is whacked there instead of retained for
# a recession that can never come. hq_U OWNS THE BUILD (frames, concern 3); the cto is the measurer on the
# Prolog half and this file is that measurement. IT LANDS NO CURE AND GRADES NO CURE -- the wired verdict for
# rung 9 is test_gate_pl_iso_rung9_a_backtrackable_recursion_reaches_the_depth_the_oracle_reaches.sh, and
# this script exists so that hq_U can re-run the same population after a teardown lands and read which
# constructs moved. Run it before and after; a construct that does not move is a construct the cure missed.
#
# ⭐ THE QUESTION CEO-690 ASKED, and nobody had enumerated: WHICH PROLOG CONSTRUCTS ARE PROVABLY COMMITTED AT
# GAMMA BUT CARRY NO LEXICAL `!`? Each of those is a cut in effect with no cut in the text -- a frame that
# could be whacked today and is not. This script answers it by measurement rather than by reading the
# lowerer, because the lowerer can only say what was intended.
#
# METHOD. One recursion shape, one variable: the goal that sits between the guard and the recursive call.
#     p(0) :- !.
#     p(N) :- N > 0, <BODY>, N1 is N - 1, p(N1).
# <BODY> is the construct under test. The largest N that completes is found by bisection at a `ulimit -s`
# PINNED IN A SUBSHELL AND PRINTED -- an unpinned run grades the shell and not the compiler. Bytes per
# retained frame is the pinned limit divided by that depth, AND THE DIVISOR IS PART OF THE LABEL: this gate's
# sibling published a 4x unit error in 2026-09-13 by taking a depth at one limit and dividing by another.
#
# ⛔ NO NUMBER HERE MEANS ANYTHING ALONE. Every construct lands between two anchors measured in the same run
# on the same tree:
#   UPPER  anchor_cut  `q(_), !`   -- the same nondeterministic call, lexically fenced. The mechanism works
#                                     where it is wired, so this is what a cured construct must reach.
#   LOWER  anchor_cp   `q(_)`      -- the same call with nothing fenced, and the choicepoints it leaves are
#                                     LIVE (see the SAFETY CONTROL below). This is what un-whacked costs.
# A construct sitting at the lower anchor is a PRIZE. A construct sitting at the upper anchor is already
# reclaimed and is reported as such, because a witness set that lists only the red ones cannot show that the
# mechanism exists in the tree already.
#
# ⛔⭐ THE SAFETY CONTROL IS NOT A FOOTNOTE, IT IS THE GRADING CRITERION (CEO-690, CEO-550). GAMMA IS THE
# SHARED YIELD PORT FOR SUSPEND AND RETURN, so a generator that suspends through gamma expects to be resumed
# INTO THAT VERY FRAME. An unconditional whack tears down a frame a redo is about to re-enter. This script
# therefore runs a pair whose ANSWERS separate the two cases, and any cure must keep both:
#   cp(8)   -- `q(X)` un-fenced under a 3-deep recursion has 2^3 solutions; its frames MUST be retained.
#   once(1) -- the same recursion with `once(q(X))` has exactly 1; its frames may be whacked.
# Both are swipl-confirmed. If a teardown lands and cp(8) becomes anything else, the cure is wrong and the
# depth table is irrelevant.
#
# ⛔ AND THE CLASSIFICATION THAT DECIDES HOW A CURE MAY BE KEYED, which is the other half of CEO-690:
#   PER CALL SITE   -- once/1, \+/1, forall/2, the condition of (->)/2, catch/3 over a committed goal. These
#                      are OPAQUE-GOAL BARRIERS: the text of the call site alone proves beta is unreachable,
#                      whatever the argument goal does. A call-site-keyed cure is sound for these.
#   PER ACTIVATION  -- clause selection. Whether a later clause can still match depends on the ARGUMENTS AT
#                      THIS CALL, not on the call site: `d(1,_)` is deterministic and `d(X,_)` with X unbound
#                      is not, at the same site. A call-site-keyed answer here is right in testing and wrong
#                      in the tree, which is exactly the hazard CEO-690 named.
