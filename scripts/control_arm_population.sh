# control_arm_population.sh -- THE POPULATION HALF OF A SHARED-NODE CONTROL ARM (coo 2026-09-17, ceo CEO-827 (3)).
#
# WHERE THIS RUNS.  A board run holds ONE reading and can diff nothing, and under CEO-775 each language runner
# produces exactly one board per landing -- so THE ONLY PLACE TWO READINGS OF ONE SUITE EXIST AT ONCE is the
# base-vs-head control arm the SHARED-NODE VERDICT SCOPE bar already requires.  That arm hands both readings here,
# and THE DIFF'S VERDICT BECOMES PART OF THE ARM'S VERDICT (CEO-827): "no worse than the clean tree" has always
# meant the pass count, and a landing can hold the pass count while three programs stop being graded.
#
#   bash scripts/control_arm_population.sh BASE_OUT HEAD_OUT
#
# Each argument is the runner's FULL saved output for one tree -- stdout and stderr together, captured with
# SUITE_LIST_ALL=1 set, e.g.:
#   SUITE_LIST_ALL=1 bash scripts/test_corpus_snobol4.sh > /tmp/base.out 2>&1
#
# ⛔ SUITE_LIST_ALL IS ENFORCED HERE, NOT REQUESTED.  Without it the harness prints a 40-line SAMPLE of its non-PASS
# entries, and three skips in a 1982-entry board are exactly what a sample hides -- so a reading that names no
# entries at all makes this arm REFUSE rc=2 rather than hand back a verdict it cannot support with names.
#   rc=0  the population is identical: the pass counts either side are comparable, and the arm may proceed.
#   rc=1  a SKIP count or the graded denominator MOVED -- named, with the entries where they are nameable.
#   rc=2  could not measure: a missing file, no board line, no entry lines, or two readings of different suites.
