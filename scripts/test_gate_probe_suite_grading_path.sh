# scripts/test_gate_probe_suite_grading_path.sh -- DONE-WHEN for row probe-suite-grading-path.
# Before this row: there was NO working path to grade a probe/-sourced suite file
# (corpus-suite-family-list-should-autodiscover's autodiscovery was crosscheck/-scoped only, and
# scorecard_snobol4.sh's probes_misc ran a suite file whole -- a category error per
# corpus_suite_harness.py's own top-of-file warning: it fails two ways that both LOOK like real
# defects). TWO-PART PROOF (RULES.md): a real probe/ suite family must actually grade entry-by-entry
# on the SNOBOL4 board (POSITIVE), and probes_misc must REFUSE (rc=2, named reason) on a suite file
# it cannot enumerate rather than silently mis-grade it (NEGATIVE). REFUSES rc=2 when it cannot
# measure -- never skip-as-success.
