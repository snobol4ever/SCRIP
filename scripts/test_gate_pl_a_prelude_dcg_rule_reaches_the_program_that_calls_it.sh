# test_gate_pl_a_prelude_dcg_rule_reaches_the_program_that_calls_it.sh -- a nonterminal the prelude defines as a DCG rule
# (utf8_codes//1 of library(utf8), sequence//2 of library(dcg/high_order)) reaches a program that calls it, and a program
# that defines a nonterminal of the same name keeps its own (cto 2026-10-01, on hq_prolog's report: swi_tests test_utf8
# fell from 45 to 0 of 94).
#
# THE REGRESSION THIS PINS, AND IT WAS MINE. b1cde82b2 (the parser_prolog.sc tree landing) moved the C parser's DCG
# translation into the lowerer's pre-pass, so a DCG rule reaches prolog_inject_prelude untranslated as
# (TT_CLAUSE (TT_FNC --> Head Body)). pl_clause_key keyed it -->/2 and the dependency walk read no body, so no prelude DCG
# rule was ever wanted: phrase(utf8_codes(L), Codes) raised existence_error(procedure, utf8_codes/3). pl_clause_key now
# keys a DCG rule by its nonterminal (the head left of a pushback) with arity + 2, and pl_clause_body hands the walk the
# rule's body. A user DCG rule is keyed the same way, which is what keeps the prelude's row out when the user defines it.
# rc 0 green · 1 red · 2 could not measure.
