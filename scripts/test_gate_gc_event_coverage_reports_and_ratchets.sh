# test_gate_gc_event_coverage_reports_and_ratchets.sh -- row gc-event-coverage-is-the-criterion-not-collection-count
# (coo, 2026-09-21, MODE TENET, CEO-1029; RULES.md THE INSTRUMENT LAWS; CEO-997 batch 30 clause 2 -- a census NAMES
# and never only counts).
#
# WHY THE AXIS CHANGED. A stress setting only tests the gc-points where a collection ACTUALLY OCCURS, and that subset
# need not differ between executions, so COLLECTION COUNT is the wrong axis. bench_icnstr_concat_table.icn at
# SCRIP_HEAP_MB=1 gives 38781 collections at stress 1, 32015 at stress 5 and 10006 at stress 16 -- and hq_raku found
# 36 silently-wrong Raku programs at stress 16 that stress 1, 3 and 5 all called GREEN. FEWER COLLECTIONS FOUND MORE
# DEFECTS. GCFuzz names the right axis: EVENT COVERAGE. This gate makes that axis measurable and keeps it from falling.
#
# ⛔ THE DENOMINATOR IS THE WHOLE POINT, SO IT IS PRINTED THREE WAYS. This row exists because a green instrument was
# measuring the wrong axis; ratcheting a SUBSET and letting it read as "the event space" would be that same offence
# one level up. util_gc_event_coverage.py therefore prints OBSERVABLE (15, with telemetry the collector already emits),
# OWED (2, real events the collector cannot distinguish -- NAMED, never dropped) and ABSENT (1, named in the row's
# goal and nonexistent here). arena_shrink is ABSENT and not merely uncovered: g_hp_end is only ever advanced
# (gc_heap.c:160) or initialised (:179), and the one munmap (:502) is gcbk_drop over the collector's OWN bookkeeping,
# never the object arena. Carrying it as a bucket would read as permanent 0% coverage of a thing that cannot happen,
# so its absence is ASSERTED instead: the day a shrink path lands, arm 2 REDS and demands it be reclassified.
#
# ⛔⭐ THE MEASUREMENT THAT SHAPED THE PROBE SET, because it bounds what any coverage number here can mean. ONE binary,
# ONE tree, ONE witness, the ONLY difference the SPELLING OF THE PATH handed to ./scrip:
#     scripts/gc_witnesses/hb_nv.sno   -> interior=1        ./scripts/gc_witnesses/hb_nv.sno -> interior=0
# Three runs each, no variation within a spelling. The source path is itself a heap block, so its length shifts every
# block after it and decides whether any reference lands INTERIOR to one. A COVERAGE READING IS A PROPERTY OF
# (program, stress, INVOCATION). Every probe in the set was therefore re-run under all three spellings and kept only
# if it reached its event at the SAME count every time -- a ratchet resting on a marginal event would red or green on
# whether a caller wrote `scripts/x` or `./scripts/x`. ⭐ And the same measurement is a finding for the fleet: two
# seats running the same witness at the same stress from roots of different name length ARE EXERCISING DIFFERENT GC
# EVENTS, and no board line says so.
#
# ⛔ A "NOT EXERCISED" VERDICT CARRIES ITS BOUND (hq_P's law: A NULL RESULT BOUNDS THE PROBE, NOT THE THING PROBED).
# The two uncovered events are not probe artifacts: the ENTIRE 96-witness gc_witnesses pool was swept at
# SCRIP_HEAP_MB=1 stress 1 and NOT ONE witness grows the arena or inserts a fill block. Both holes are printed with
# that sweep beside them, and an uncovered event with NO sweep evidence prints UNBOUNDED rather than reading as a hole.
#
# ARMS. (1) the instrument runs, reports the whole space, and the RATCHET HOLDS -- no floor event has stopped being
# exercised. (2) the ABSENT assertion still holds (no arena-shrink path appeared). (3) the report is DENOMINATOR-HONEST:
# it names OWED and ABSENT explicitly and prints the identity. (4) FAIL-ONCE PROOF: a floor carrying an event nothing
# exercises must RED -- a ratchet that cannot fail is not a ratchet. ⛔ This seat holds no cure lane (CEO-723): every
# observable event is read from telemetry already in the tree and every OWED event is an ask, not an edit.
