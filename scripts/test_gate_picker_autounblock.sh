#!/usr/bin/env bash
# test_gate_picker_autounblock.sh -- DONE-WHEN gate for picker-skips-blocked-rows (ceo, 2026-08-28).
#
# BEFORE this row: a row encoded as BLOCKED-ON:<topic>/PARKED-AWAITING:<topic> in QUEUE.tsv's state column
# skipped next()'s PASS 3 FOREVER, even the session after <topic> landed DONE -- nothing ever re-asked. The
# live symptom: bench-rivals-raku-pascal sat encoded as plain "FREE" (the OTHER half of the same defect --
# nobody had even written the block down) and was re-discovered blocked by 9+ seats in one day.
#
# THIS GATE PROVES, against a SANDBOX postoffice (never the live one):
#   U1  a BLOCKED-ON row stays unpickable while its named blocker is still open (the row itself, in isolation
#       -- not just "some OTHER free row wins," which would also be true before this fix)
#   U2  the moment the blocker's claim carries DONE, a fresh `next` serves the previously-blocked row
#   U3  serving it self-heals the QUEUE.tsv state column back to FREE (so a human never has to remember to)
#   U4  PARKED-AWAITING:<topic> (the pre-existing spelling several real rows already use) gets the same cure
#   U5  a blocker resolved only via QUEUE.done.tsv (no live claim file at all) still unblocks -- the DONE-WHEN's
#       own "claims/ or QUEUE.done.tsv" wording, taken literally
#
# ⛔ NEGATIVE-TESTED: --self-check re-runs U2/U4/U5 with the pre-fix (permanently-stuck) answer injected in
# place of the real one -- same technique test_gate_s4e_picker_v2.sh already uses -- and requires itself to
# FAIL. A gate that cannot say NO is not a gate (seat16 measured 31/105 that cannot).
