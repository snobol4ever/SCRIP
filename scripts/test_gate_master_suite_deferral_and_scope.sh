# test_gate_master_suite_deferral_and_scope.sh -- the executable DONE-WHEN for row
# `master-suite-builder-honours-deferral-contract-and-scopes-absorption` (hq_P mint 2026-09-02,
# CEO-137 addendum, ladder I rank 1).
#
# WHAT IT PROVES, one arm per requirement named in the task file (all four watched FAIL before this row,
# on hq_P's own measured witnesses -- see the task file for the receipts this gate turns into assertions):
#   A/B. NEVER ABSORBS A KEEPER OR A DEFERRED FILE (requirement 1) -- a family declared in a KEEP.md, and
#        a family listed under a PENDING.md's `## DEFERRED` heading, both stay loose and both are recorded
#        with a named reason in ALL.excluded.txt; neither's origin appears in ALL.csv.
#   C.   ...AND DOES NOT OVER-EXCLUDE -- an ordinary undeclared family in the SAME tree absorbs normally.
#   D/E. --absorb-only <families> SCOPES ABSORPTION ITSELF (requirement 2) -- naming one family among
#        several absorbable ones absorbs exactly that one; naming a family this run cannot absorb (here,
#        one under active KEEP declaration) REFUSES rc=2 and writes nothing.
#   F.   --help AND AN UNKNOWN FLAG TOUCH NOTHING (requirement 4) -- neither reaches the build logic;
#        --help exits 0, an unrecognized argument exits rc=2, both leave the scratch tree byte-identical.
#        (Same control-arm shape as the separate, still-FREE row master-builder-argparse-loud-refuse,
#        whose entire scope this requirement subsumes -- see this gate's own LEDGER note on that overlap.)
#   G.   VALIDATES BEFORE IT WRITES (requirement 3) -- a forced post-write round-trip failure (monkeypatched
#        into the SAME process, since the real defect only ever reproduces once in a great while and this
#        reproduces it on demand) must leave a PRE-EXISTING committed master byte-identical and no stray
#        `.tmp-*` files behind. Before this row: the master was written directly, so this exact failure mode
#        left a corrupted master requiring `git checkout` to undo.
#
# ⛔ EVERY ARM RUNS ON A SCRATCH COPY, never the live master. Reads corpus/tests/snobol4 for its own
# fixtures not at all -- every fixture here is FULLY SYNTHETIC, built via the harness's own Entry/write_suite
# (never a second suite-grammar writer), because copying the real ~1700-entry master alongside a couple of
# fresh synthetic pairs trips the (correct, unrelated) collapse-refusal guard.

# family (pendfam_probe). Built as BLOCK-kind entries via the harness's own Entry/write_suite.
# ⭐ ALSO a synthetic postoffice at <dir>/postoffice, so the PENDING.md's row resolves LIVE deterministically
# via S4E_POST -- never the real fleet queue at /home/resources/postoffice. A deferral only blocks absorption
# while its row is LIVE (requirement 1, row-state resolution mirrors test_gate_suite_conversion_complete.sh's
# own pending_row_state()); pointing at a REAL row would make this gate's verdict depend on that row's
# CURRENT fleet state, which drifts (exactly the row this task itself fixed, coexpr-stack-*, could land and
# flip this gate red for a reason having nothing to do with the builder).
