# test_gate_harness_shard_reads_the_outside_list_from_the_unsharded_entries.sh -- A SHARD GRADES ITS SLICE, BUT THE OUTSIDE LIST IS
# CHECKED AGAINST THE WHOLE SUITE (hq_snobol4 2026-09-24 08:2x; ceo CEO-1233 (d); row instruments-the-harness-shard-filter-cuts-the-
# entry-list-before-the-outside-list-presence-check-so-every-sharded-run-of-a-suite-with-an-outside-list-refuses).
#
# THE DEFECT, MEASURED: on SCRIP 83d50401d / corpus fdc8455da, --shard 1/6 .. 6/6 of the SNOBOL4 master REFUSED rc=2 in 6 of 6
# shards. The shard filter (d837851d7) cut the entry list BEFORE the outside-list presence check (c2178f2b6 / 2fae6f711) built its
# present-set from it, so every outside name that fell in another shard read "declares entries that are not in this suite -- a stale
# outside list". All 8 names ARE in the master, and test_corpus_snobol4.sh passes --outside with --shard, so SnoM's --shard/--combine
# road refused whenever it was used; the monolithic run was unaffected.
#
# THE CURE UNDER TEST: the present-set is the unsharded suite's; the per-shard outside= still counts only the entries THIS shard
# removed, so the shards' fields sum to the monolithic board's exactly as board_combine adds them.
#
# ARMS (hermetic: a four-entry suite cut from the live master under mktemp in a tests/snobol4/ALL.sno layout, entries 2 and 3
# declared outside in the SIBLING list, so the list spans both shards of --shard k/2 -- k=1 takes entries 1 and 3, k=2 takes 2 and 4;
# the progress DB redirected by S4E_PROGRESS_DB to a scratch table; a fixture outside the corpus is not a board, CEO-547):
#   (a) --shard 1/2 GRADES (rc <= 1, no refusal): SUITE_BOARD shard=1/2 total=1 shipped=2 outside=1, entry 3 named OUTSIDE
#   (b) --shard 2/2 GRADES the same way: shard=2/2 total=1 shipped=2 outside=1, entry 2 named OUTSIDE
#   (c) the two shards SUM to the monolithic run: total 1+1=2, shipped 2+2=4, outside 1+1=2
#   (d) the staleness check still bites under --shard: a list naming an entry the WHOLE suite lacks refuses rc=2 in both shards,
#       naming that entry and not the in-suite outside names
# FAIL_ONCE=1 blanks shard 1's captured SUITE_BOARD line before arm (a) grades -- what the old order produced, a refusal with no
# board -- to prove the arm trips. The row's fail-once against the old order itself is this gate RED on the cure's parent, quoted in
# the landing's commit message.
# rc 0 = every arm holds; rc 1 = a FAIL named; rc 2 = REFUSED-TO-GRADE (no binary, no master to cut the fixture from).
