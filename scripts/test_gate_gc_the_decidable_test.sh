# test_gate_gc_the_decidable_test.sh -- F6 STEP 6, THE DECIDABLE TEST (coo; ceo CEO-869/876, hq_snocone's ask).
#
# ⛔⭐ THE QUESTION IS NOT "DOES THE COLLECTOR FIND THE ROOTS".  IT IS: CAN A SUITE BE GREEN WHILE IT DOES NOT?
# THE MEASUREMENT THAT MAKES THIS THE CRITICAL PATH (the cto, 2026-09-18; reproduced by the ceo on an Icon master
# entry): 320 master entries across four frontends run with ZERO COLLECTIONS at default settings.  So every
# master board we own today is green over a collector that never ran once.  When three seats land F6 step 4's
# 208 poll sites, NOTHING WE OWN CAN TELL US WHETHER THEY ARE RIGHT -- not a board, not a smoke, not a master.
# A green suite is evidence about the collector only if something FORCES it to run, FORCES the heap to slide
# under a live value, and then READS THAT VALUE BACK.  That is what each witness here does, per registered kind.
#
# THE FOUR THINGS EVERY WITNESS MUST PROVE, because any one of them missing makes a green meaningless:
#   (1) it allocates THE KIND IT CLAIMS          -- from SCRIP_ALLOC_HIST, never from the table's say-so
#   (2) a collection actually HAPPENED           -- [ZGC-MARK] lines, else it is the 320-entry reading again
#   (3) the heap actually MOVED under it         -- moved=NB > 0, else nothing was asked of the root fixups
#   (4) the value read back is still correct     -- with SCRIP_GC_POISON on, a lost root reads 0xDB, not stale data
#
# ⛔ THE STRESS BAND IS PART OF THE TEST AND ITS LOW END IS THE PART THAT MATTERS (ceo CEO-876, on the cfo's cset
# defect): that defect was RED at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10 and GREEN at 0, 15, 20, 30, 50, 100.  HIGH-AND-HIGHER
# LOOKS more punishing and is the opposite -- a low stress count puts the collection at a different point
# relative to the allocation, and a two-point check at 30 and 200 reads clean and banks the defect (CEO-807).
# The band is PRINTED per kind, never collapsed into a verdict.
#
# ⛔ THE DENOMINATOR IS THE DECLARATION.  Every `#define HB_*` in gc_heap.h must have a row in
# gc_kind_witnesses.tsv.  A kind added without one REFUSES rc=2: a kind nobody witnesses is precisely a kind the
# suite can be green while the collector loses, and a hand-kept list that falls behind its own declaration is
# this disease wearing the cure's clothes.

# up.  So a witness is run against a DELIBERATELY WRONG expectation and the comparator must reject it.

# ---- ARM 7: THE SENSITIVITY ARM -- THIS IS THE QUESTION, ASKED BY EXPERIMENT -------------------------------
# ⛔⭐ EVERY ARM ABOVE SAYS "THE VALUE SURVIVED".  NONE OF THEM SAYS THE WITNESS COULD HAVE NOTICED IF IT HAD NOT.
# That gap is the entire subject of this gate: a suite that passes over a collector that never ran, or whose
# roots were never really exercised, is green for reasons unrelated to correctness -- which is exactly the state
# the cto measured across 320 master entries.  So the collector is DELIBERATELY BROKEN and each witness must be
# seen to FAIL.  SCRIP_GC_PLANT_PIN_SKIP=n denies the nth marked block a forwarding address, so the heap slides
# around it and every reference to it is left pointing at whatever now occupies that address -- a lost root, by
# the collector's own [ZGC-PIN] VIOLATION definition.  A witness that stays green through that is not a witness.
# ⭐ The skip values are swept and the FIRST one that trips is recorded: which n reaches a given kind's block
# depends on mark order, so a fixed n would silently stop reaching some kind after any allocation change -- and
# the arm would go quiet rather than red, which is the failure mode this whole gate exists against.
