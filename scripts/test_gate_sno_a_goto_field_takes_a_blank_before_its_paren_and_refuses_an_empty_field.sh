# THE ROW (ceo CEO-1449, found on the cfo's CODE row 302976d18): snobol4-the-goto-field-refuses-a-blank-before-its-paren-and-
# accepts-an-empty-field-the-reverse-of-spitbol. '        X = 1  :S (L1)' runs in sbl -bf and SCRIP refused the whole program;
# '        X = 1  :' is sbl's compile error 219 and SCRIP compiled and ran it -- both directions wrong under ONE PARSER, ONE DIALECT
# (CEO-1428 (2)). The CODE-only pair folded in: CODE('*comment') and CODE('') compile in sbl and failed in SCRIP.
#
# SPITBOL'S RULE (sbl.min cmp13-cmp31 and scngf; measured on sbl -bf): in a goto field S and F may be followed by blanks before
# their ( or <, and so may the ':' (': S(L1)'); a field ends at its close, so 'S(L1) F(L2)' is two fields; a ':' with no field
# after it is 219, whether a newline, a ';' or blanks follow. A goto continued on the next line ('+' in column 1) is one field.
# CODE of text with no statement ('', ' ', '*comment') compiles; jumping to it runs off its end, which ends the program as a
# CODE block's end always does, and it takes ONE statement number (the implicit end), as a k-statement CODE takes k + 1.
# THE CURE: snobol4.l -- the four S/F goto rules take [ \t]* in their trailing context, and the goto state reports 219 at its
# statement end when no field completed since the ':' (gt_have_operand, which a field's closing ) already set and its closing >
# now sets too: no new state); runtime_eval.c code_at -- CODE('') reaches the parser, a text that parses to no statement and
# captured no error compiles one empty statement, and a CODE whose statements are all empty is not counted.
#
# Every expectation is cut from sbl -bf AT RUN TIME. FAIL-ONCE, MEASURED with this gate on the parent (SCRIP 8f0d5fa04, the cure
# stashed): 11 of 21 arms RED -- the three blank-before-paren gotos (S (, F (, S <) refused; the three empty fields compiled and ran
# ('fell'); CODE('') and CODE('*comment') failed; CODE(' X = 1 :') compiled; &STNO after an empty CODE read 5 where sbl says 6.
# The continued goto and CODE(' ') were already green. On the cure 21/21. rc=0 clean · rc=1 a divergence · rc=2 REFUSAL.
