#
# WHAT IT PROVES, hermetically, in BOTH directions on one tree (the row's DONE-WHEN):
#   (a) REFUSE -> MARKER : a *.pl under corpus/demos/prolog/** whose --compile refuses with the ladder's
#       'is not on the ladder yet' line has its committed .s REPLACED by <name>.s.REFUSED naming the rung.
#       A pre-cut .s carrying by-name rt_call_arr_bl calls must NOT survive the run.
#   (b) MARKER -> REAL .s: the same script, on a program that DOES compile today, deletes the stale marker
#       and writes real asm -- so the marker is self-retiring the first run after its rung lands.
#   (c) The graceful-skip is NOT collateral damage: the 21 sanctioned SNOBOL4 demo names still regenerate.
#   (d) Nested trees are covered (family_net/ is a real nested demo dir) -- enumerate-by-search, not by roster.
#
# ⛔ HERMETIC BY CONSTRUCTION: it builds a throwaway CORPUS under mktemp and never touches the real corpus, so it
# is safe to run at any time and cannot commit anything (the script under test skips its commit block on a non-repo).
# ⛔ THE SANCTIONED LIST IS READ OUT OF THE SCRIPT UNDER TEST, never re-typed here: a gate that keeps its own copy of
# the roster drifts away from the thing it guards, and then both are wrong together -- the guard-and-its-own-canary
# failure mode this project has already paid for twice (util_oracle_flag_sweep.sh, test_gate_argnote_sweep.sh).
# SUT= overrides the script under test (used to prove the gate FAILS against the pre-cure script -- fail-once).
