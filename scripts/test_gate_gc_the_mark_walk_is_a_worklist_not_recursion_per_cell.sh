# test_gate_gc_the_mark_walk_is_a_worklist_not_recursion_per_cell.sh -- A COLLECTOR MUST WALK A LONG DATA CHAIN ON A
# BOUNDED C STACK (row gc-descriptor-walk-recurses-once-per-list-cell-and-overflows-the-c-stack-on-a-long-data-chain;
# ceo ruling CEO-822, which put this row AHEAD of the F6 step-3 reporter because a divergence census that cannot run at
# all on the class that stresses the collector hardest would hand back a zero meaning NEVER MEASURED, and DARK is worse
# than RED).
#
# THE DEFECT, MEASURED ON ORIGIN b12714737: rt_gc_visit_descr recursed once per DATA instance along a CDR chain -- one C
# frame per cell -- so a collection with a 600000-cell CONS list live died with ERROR 246 (stack overflow) and
# COLLECTIONS=0 in BOTH modes, while a 60000-cell control printed 60000 at rc=0. The process died inside the mark walk
# before one collection completed. Cure: the aggregate arms push onto an explicit heap worklist (gc_wl_push) which
# rt_gc_visit_descr drains, so the C depth is bounded (gc_visit_one -> gc_visit_vcell -> gc_visit_tbblk -> push) no
# matter how long the chain is. The row's GOAL said to measure what SCRIP_GC_WORKLIST already covers before adding a
# switch: IT COVERS NOTHING -- that name is in no file under src/, and git log -S finds it only in f2270e807, the
# landing that DELETED all eight env-gated alternate collector paths. There is deliberately no new switch here either;
# the collector has one behaviour.
#
# ⭐ ARM 3 IS THE ONE THAT CANNOT BE FAKED. A cure that simply stopped walking the chain would pass arms 1 and 2 (rc=0,
# right answer) while silently collecting live data. Arm 3 reads wl_depth_max out of the [ZGC] telemetry and requires it
# to SCALE WITH THE CHAIN: a 1.5M-cell chain must put more than a million entries on the heap worklist. That number is
# the walk itself, so the arm is vacuous only if the collector is doing the work.
#
# FAIL-ONCE IS MEASURED, NOT ASSERTED: on origin b12714737 (this cure stashed, runtime rebuilt, this gate left in place)
# arms 1, 2 and 3 all read red -- rc=1, ERROR 246, empty output, collections=0.
#
# ⛔⭐ THE CEILING IS ARENA-AWARE, AND A CEILING THAT FIRES IS A REFUSAL, NOT A RED (coo 2026-09-20, on the cfo's
# measurement CFO-121/122; the cure was the cfo's to report and the coo's to choose). This gate's three ceilings were
# calibrated against the SHIPPED arena. `make test-arena` runs the same arms at SCRIP_HEAP_MB=1, where the scaling
# program is forced through 1106 collections and needs 651 SECONDS against its 300-second ceiling -- so the arm timed
# out, rc=124, and test-arena reported it as a COLLECTOR red owing a row. ⭐ THE PROPERTY THE GATE EXISTS TO MEASURE
# HELD WHILE IT FAILED: the cfo read wl_depth_max=2118170, past this arm's own 1000000 bar, so the mark walk WAS an
# explicit worklist and the chain WAS being walked. A red that is a clock reads exactly like a red that is a lost root,
# and it cost a seat its attribution work on an otherwise clean arena pass.
#   TWO CHANGES, and the second is the one that matters: (1) the ceilings scale with the arena; (2) rc=124 is a
# GATE REFUSE(2) naming the clock, the arena and the ceiling -- never a FAIL. A timeout is COULD NOT MEASURE, which is
# rc=2 under the INSTRUMENT LAWS, and no ceiling I can pick makes that judgement unnecessary: an under-set ceiling now
# reports ITSELF instead of manufacturing a collector finding.
#   ⛔ THE NUMBERS, EACH LABELLED WITH WHAT IS BEHIND IT: 900s for the scaling arm at a tiny arena is the cfo's
# MEASURED 651s (SCRIP_HEAP_MB=1, rc=0, out=1500000, collections=1106, wl_depth_max=3000000, wall 09:19:09-09:30:00)
# plus headroom. 600s for the two 600000-cell arms is DECLARED, not measured -- no one has run them at 1 MB -- and it
# is safe to declare precisely because (2) turns a wrong guess into a refusal rather than into a red.

# chain is 600000 cells of 48 bytes (28.8 MB live by construction; the scaling arm's 1.5M cells are 72 MB). Since
# CEO-1101 the declared size is a HARD CAP: the unset default is a 4096 KB cap and make's SCRIP_HEAP_MB=1 is 1024 KB,
# and under either the chain arm dies rc=134 'heap exhausted AT THE HARD CAP' after 5962 collections with 87011 blocks
# live -- measured 2026-09-23 on 89956530b, which is how this gate read red at CEO-1161. A mark-walk depth is not an
# arena-dependent quantity, so the pin below names a window the witness fits and the ceilings stay the ones this gate
# was calibrated against at the old shipped reserve. The outer KB knob is unset because gc_heap.c reads it LAST and
