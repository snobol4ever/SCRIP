# test_gate_sno_pattern_position_expression.sh -- AN ARBITRARY EXPRESSION IN PATTERN POSITION LOWERS, and the
# gate that its acceptance is NOT decided by a per-op allowlist.
#
# THE CLASS. A SNOBOL4 statement `SUBJECT PATTERN` may carry, as its PATTERN, any expression whose VALUE is
# the pattern -- SNOBOL4 evaluates the pattern expression first, then matches. lower_snobol4.c has always had
# the correct general machinery for this (the runtime-pattern fallback at the sno_pat_supported() miss: stage
# the expression into PATTMP$n, match the subject against the deferred temp, omega wired to the statement's
# failure branch). Until 2026-09-06 that fallback was gated on a PER-OP ALLOWLIST --
# `ptt->t == TT_FNC || ptt->t == TT_INDIRECT || sno_is_pattern_rhs(ptt)` -- and every expression kind not
# enumerated there died at sno_fatal instead, WITH A MESSAGE BLAMING "Pattern matching, EVAL and CODE".
#
# ⛔ THAT SHAPE IS BANNED BY NAME (RULES.md, NO PER-OP FILTER): "no code path may admit or refuse family
# members by op identity, and no per-op exception list may exist anywhere. A defect reachable through one
# member is a class defect: fix the class or leave the class visibly red." The allowlist was deleted rather
# than extended; sx_lower now refuses on its own terms, with its own accurate message, for expression forms it
# genuinely cannot lower.
#
# ⭐ WHY THE CONTROL ARMS ARE THE POINT OF THIS GATE. pat_expr_fnc_control.sno (`subject SIZE(word)`) PASSED
# before the cure and passes after -- not because a function call is special, but because TT_FNC happened to
# be one of the three names on the list. pat_expr_arith.sno (`subject counter + 1`) is the same kind of thing
# and died. A gate that only swept the newly-cured forms could not tell "the class is cured" from "three more
# names were added to the list"; the control arm is what makes that distinguishable.
#
# WITNESSES (corpus/tests/snobol4, .ref cut from the oracle, never hand-typed):
#   pat_expr_interrogate         `subject ?side('one') ?side('two')`  -- unary ?, operands succeed, in order
#   pat_expr_interrogate_fail    `subject ?failer()`                  -- unary ?, operand FAILS => stmt fails
#   pat_expr_interrogate_mixed   `SPAN('abc') ?side('mid') SPAN('123') . digits` -- composes with real pattern
#                                                                       functions AND a capture. ⛔ CONTROL:
#                                                                       this one PASSED BEFORE the cure too --
#                                                                       sno_is_pattern_rhs(TT_SEQ) is true if
#                                                                       EITHER child qualifies, so the SPAN
#                                                                       dragged the whole pattern onto the
#                                                                       allowlist. `subject ?side('mid')` was
#                                                                       FATAL while `subject SPAN('abc')
#                                                                       ?side('mid')` worked -- the same
#                                                                       operator, decided by what stood next
#                                                                       to it. That accident is the argument
#                                                                       against per-op gating, and it is why
#                                                                       this witness is a control, not a cure.
#   pat_expr_negation            `subject ~failer()`                  -- unary ~, same manual section as ?
#   pat_expr_arith               `subject counter + 1`                -- an expression that is not an operator
