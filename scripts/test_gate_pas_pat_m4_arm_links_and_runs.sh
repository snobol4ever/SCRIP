# test_gate_pas_pat_m4_arm_links_and_runs.sh -- the PAT rejection arm's m4 column may never go back to compile-only
#
# WHY THIS GATE EXISTS (hq_pascal 2026-09-16, cfo ruling with the ceo copied, row pascal-pat-suite-427-to-100-percent-by-class).
# test_pascal_pat_suite.sh graded its REJECTION arm's m4 column with `--compile -o /dev/null`, which only COMPILES. A
# rejection test whose ISO condition fires at RUN time therefore could never fail that arm, so the m4 column did not mean
# "refused in m4", it meant "refused AT COMPILE TIME in m4", and both_pass was floored by the instrument rather than by
# the engine. MEASURED ON ONE TREE (SCRIP e83244874): old arm both_pass=284 m4_pass=284 m4_fail=143; new arm
# both_pass=296 m4_pass=296 m4_fail=131. TWELVE entries changed class, ZERO went the other way.
#
# ⛔ THIS GATE IS NOT A BOARD AND MUST NEVER BECOME ONE. It grades its OWN minted fixture in a mktemp dir, never the
# vendored PAT population, so it carries no one-runner guard and any seat may run it (CEO-547: the population decides).
#
# THE TWO ARMS:
#  (1) STRUCTURAL -- the runner's m4 rejection arm must link and run, and must not grade with `--compile -o /dev/null`.
#      A structural check alone would be a grep that a refactor could satisfy while changing the meaning, which is why
#      arm (2) exists and is the one that actually decides.
#  (2) BEHAVIOURAL, AND IT IS THE POINT -- a minted witness whose ISO condition fires ONLY at run time is compiled,
#      linked and run. Compile-only must report SUCCESS on it (proving a compile-only arm is blind to this witness) and
#      compile-link-run must report FAILURE (proving the arm we ship can see it). If those two ever agree, either the
#      witness stopped being runtime-only or the arm stopped running, and both mean this gate can no longer tell the
#      difference -- so it REFUSES rc=2 rather than passing, because an instrument that cannot discriminate must not
#      report the success shape.
