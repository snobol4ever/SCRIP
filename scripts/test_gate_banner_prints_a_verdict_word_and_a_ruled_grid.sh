# ⛔⭐ THE GATE THAT DID NOT EXIST WHEN IT WAS NEEDED (cfo 2026-09-13, on Lon's word "Hey where is the banner
# showing SUCCESS and FAILURE?"). The printed banner was deleted at c902a4b73 and for the hours that followed
# EVERY SEAT'S Stop hook fired an EMPTY STRING -- measured, rc=0 and zero bytes. Nothing caught it: the verdict
# was still COMPUTED correctly and written to BOARD.md, so every file-reading instrument stayed green while the
# one display Lon reads every turn was blank. Lon found it before the fleet did.
# ⛔ THE LESSON THIS GATE ENCODES: a display that is only asserted through the FILE IT ALSO WRITES cannot be
# shown to have printed. Assert the PRINT, on stdout, or a silent banner is indistinguishable from a working one.
# ⭐ IT ASSERTS SHAPE, NEVER CONTENT: the verdict must be one of the four closed words and a ruled row must
# appear. It must NOT assert a suite number, a suite count, or a column set -- those move every day and a gate
# that pins them would red on honest movement, which is the failure class that deleted the display in the first
# place (a gate whose subject is the display, pinned to a constant, going stale and being "fixed" by deletion).
