# test_gate_sno_dump_matches_spitbol.sh -- &DUMP IS SPITBOL'S DUMP, BYTE FOR BYTE, IN BOTH MODES (cfo 2026-09-08/09,
# on the ceo's 22:2x ruling "your SNOBOL4 bug is &DUMP completeness", measured by hq_S on spitbol_testpgms test1).
#
# Before the cure SCRIP's end-of-run dump omitted every ARRAY, TABLE, DATA, PATTERN, EXPRESSION, NAME and CODE
# value, printed null-valued variables and its own EXPR$n temps, did not wrap at 120 bytes, dumped OUTPUT under
# its internal name, and had no &DUMP = 2 contents section at all. NOTHING GRADED EXERCISED IT (the SNOBOL4 master
# never sets &DUMP), which is the regression-protection shape the ceo's 22:1x audit named -- so this gate is the
# instrument: five witnesses, every expectation cut from the LIVE sbl -bf oracle at run time, never a stored ref,
# compared byte for byte (cmp, not a line diff: the 120-byte wrap and the trailing blank lines are the point).
#
#   1 datatypes      every datatype SPITBOL spells in a dump, nulls and internals omitted, serials #n shared
#   2 formats        prototype text kept (ARRAY(1:3)), TABLE(size), CODE, *NAME, the 120-byte wrap, reals
#   3 contents       &DUMP = 2: reachable objects in serial order, A<i> / T<key> / FIELD(NAME) = value
#   4 table order    a table's contents come out in SPITBOL's BUCKET order (hash mod size, insertion within)
#   5 hash           the string hash itself: XOR of little-endian 8-byte words XOR length; ints by magnitude;
#                    reals by bit pattern -- proved against a 1000-bucket table with integers marking every bucket
#
# A missing oracle or binary REFUSES rc=2 (a missing oracle prints a full, plausible, entirely false table).
# Exit: 0 all witnesses identical in both modes . 1 a witness differs . 2 could not measure.
