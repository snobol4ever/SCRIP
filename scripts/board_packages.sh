#!/usr/bin/env bash
# board_packages.sh — runs EVERY vendored package/third-party suite gate in one place and prints the
# denominator, so "the package suites" stops being a phrase and becomes a number nobody assembles by
# hand (MASTER-PLAN I21; task board-packages-into-make-test-reported-then-blocking).
#
# THE DENOMINATOR is corpus/packages/<lang>/<name>, walked from the live tree every run, never a
# hardcoded count -- the same shrink-detection concern board_icon_master.sh already established for
# the Icon master suite (RULES.md § the denominator law): a package directory added or removed changes
# this board's `suites=` with no script edit, and one that stops being graded shows as UNPROVEN rather
# than silently vanishing from the count.
#
# THE RUNNER MAP below is MEASURED, not named-by-convention (seat13, 2026-09-03): built by grepping
# scripts/*.sh for literal "packages/<lang>/<dir>" path references and reading every hit, because the
# naming does not derive algorithmically -- three icon jcon-* directories share one suite script, and
# two csnobol4_suite runners exist (test_snobol4_csnobol4_suite.sh and test_csnobol4_budne_suite.sh);
# only the former is wired here, since the latter still runs a "mode-2 (--run)" arm and CLAUDE.md
# records modes 1 and 2 as DELETED. A package directory absent from the map is UNPROVEN with a reason:
# either "no gate wired yet", or for icon/jcon-compiler and icon/jcon-ref specifically, "generator input
# for util_regen_jcon_generated_sources.sh, not a graded suite" -- named rather than folded into the
# same bucket as a directory nobody has gated yet, because those are two different facts.
#
# GRADED vs UNPROVEN follows every runner's own convention (RULES.md: a test that cannot measure
# REFUSES rc=2): rc=2, a missing runner, or this board's own per-suite timeout firing is UNPROVEN;
# rc=0 or any other nonzero is GRADED (clean or red respectively) -- a suite that ran and found real
# failures was still MEASURED, which is a different fact from one nothing could run at all.
#
# REPORTED, NOT BLOCKING (the task's own D1 vs D5 staging): a graded suite being RED does not fail this
# script's OWN exit code today -- only a board-wide inability to measure (scrip missing, no packages/
# tree at all) does, matching board_icon_master.sh's "a board that cannot measure refuses" split from
# "measured a suite that is legitimately red". The RED/UNPROVEN counts below are the report; turning
# them into a hard floor is D5's ratchet, not this landing's.
#
# Every constituent suite already rewrites its OWN SCORE.md vendor cell via util_score_row.py --
# Arizona, JCON, fpc, GNU and SWI already did; Snoflake and CSNOBOL4 were the two missing it and were
# given the same call this same session, matching the other five byte-for-byte in shape (same task,
# same seat, same day). This board calls util_score_row.py for none of them on purpose: that helper's
# own rule is that it is handed numbers a caller already measured and runs no suite of its own, and a
# second writer for the same cell is exactly the twin-writer class its own file header warns against.
set -uo pipefail   # NOT -e: one suite's nonzero rc must never abort the board surveying all of them (board_icon_master.sh, same reasoning)
