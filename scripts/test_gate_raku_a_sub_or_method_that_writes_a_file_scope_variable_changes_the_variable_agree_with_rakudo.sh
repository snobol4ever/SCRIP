# test_gate_raku_a_sub_or_method_that_writes_a_file_scope_variable_changes_the_variable_agree_with_rakudo.sh -- A NAMED SUB OR A METHOD THAT ASSIGNS, INCREMENTS, APPENDS TO OR PUSHES ONTO A FILE-SCOPE `my` VARIABLE CHANGES THAT VARIABLE (the outer-lexical gap), A DESTRUCTURING ASSIGNMENT AS A SUB'S LAST STATEMENT, AND AN ASSIGNMENT WHOSE RIGHT SIDE IS A TOP-LEVEL **
# (row raku-every-suite-to-100-under-nonet-ceo-1266; named in the headers of the loose-operator and hyper-operator gates as "a sub that captures a file-scope my @log and pushes to it"; the counter / flag / log idiom of the Roast files: `my $count = 0; sub inc { $count++ }`).
#
# THE DEFECT, measured against Rakudo: a named sub (or a method) that WROTE a variable declared at file scope never changed it. `my $count = 0; sub inc { $count++ }; inc(); inc(); say $count` printed 0 (Rakudo 2); `my @log; sub note($v) { @log.push($v) }` left @log empty;
# `my %seen; sub mark($k) { %seen{$k} = True }` left %seen empty; `$s ~= $t`, `$acc += $n`, `$depth++` in a recursive sub, a flag set by a sub, a counter bumped by a method, `.map: { $n += $_ }` inside a sub: every one printed the value from before the call. Reading worked (rk_file_scope_reads_are_globals), writing did not: in the SNOBOL4-style
# procedure model the names a procedure ASSIGNS are its locals, saved and restored around the call, so the write died with the call; the existing pass made a file-scope name a global only when NO sub writes it (the `!writer` test), which is exactly the case that matters. A second defect on the same path: `($p, $q) = ($q, $p)` as a sub's
# LAST statement dropped the assignment altogether (stmt_tail kept only the left parenthesis); and an ASSIGNMENT WHOSE RIGHT SIDE IS A TOP-LEVEL ** (`my $y = $x ** 3`, `$sq = $sq ** 2`, `$x **= 2`) was refused by the native emitter ("assignment to 'y' has an rhs shape with no native arm": the driver's rhs list has no power arm) unless the target happened to be a global, though `say $x ** 3` and `1 + $x ** 3` compiled.
# THE CURE: (lower_raku.c rk_globalize_file_scope_writes, after rk_cap_file_scope) every file-scope declared variable that some sub or method mutates without declaring a variable of that name itself (rk_gw_collect: rk_cap_mutated on the body, rk_cap_declared_deep on the routine) is RENAMED to NAME__fs through the whole
# program EXCEPT inside a routine or block that declares its own variable of that name (rk_gw_rename), and registered global (global_register), so the sub and the main program share one cell and a sub's own `my $x` stays a separate local; loop variables and names already boxed by the escaping-closure road are left alone; (rk_tree.c stmt_tail) a
# parenthesised-list assignment at a sub's tail is built by stmt_plain, as it is anywhere else; (lower_raku.c rk_assign_pow_rhs, a tree pass) a top-level ** on an assignment's right side is wrapped in the identity builtin __rk_item1, the way rk_scalar_rhs already turns a repetition `x` into a call, so the emitter takes the same BINOP it takes inside any larger expression (the driver's shared rhs list is NOT touched).
# NOT HERE (own rows, measured): `(@a) = (1, 2, 3)` keeps one element; a file-scope variable that is BOTH captured and mutated by an escaping closure AND written by a named sub; a state variable; the eval-string reads.
#
# THE WITNESS, graded in m3 (--run) and m4 (--compile + link) against a ref cut by Rakudo (/usr/bin/raku), then under SCRIP_GC_STRESS 1 3 5 in both modes.
# FAILED ONCE, measured on SCRIP 3436d81e1 before the cure: every witness-mode pair red.
#
# EXIT: 0 every witness matches in both modes; 1 a mismatch or a crash on a witness; 2 REFUSED (stale binary, no gcc).
