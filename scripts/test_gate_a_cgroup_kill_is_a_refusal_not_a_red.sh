# test_gate_a_cgroup_kill_is_a_refusal_not_a_red.sh -- ONE CGROUP SCOPE BOUNDS RESIDENT MEMORY AT THE OUTERMOST RUNNER, AND A
# CGROUP KILL IS A REFUSAL (the rc=2 family) THAT NAMES THE CAP AND THE PEAK, NEVER A RED.
#
# ⛔ THE DEFECT THIS GRADES (row instrument-698-runners-bound-the-clock-and-zero-bound-memory-one-cgroup-scope-bounds-resident-
# pages-and-a-cgroup-kill-is-a-refusal-not-a-red, the ceo's ruling on the cfo's measurement; the coo 2026-09-23). 698 files under
# scripts/ bounded the wall clock and ZERO bounded memory; one process reached 23,343 MB RSS in 18 s on the 30 GB box ten seats
# share, and three of the cfo's jobs were reaped for it. The mechanism and every clause's evidence: scripts/util_mem_scope.py.
#
# THE ARMS. Each "outermost" arm first steps into a NEUTRAL scope of its own (systemd-run --scope, a unit NOT named s4e-mem-),
# because under make test this gate already runs inside the blocking set's scope, where the mechanism correctly enters nothing.
#   1  FAIL-ONCE: a board runner (line 2: lib_one_runner.sh and one_runner_guard, admitted) allocates twice the cap -> the run is
#      REFUSE rc=2 naming cap= and peak=, never the child's 137 and never rc=1.
#   2  PASS-ONCE: the same runner under the cap -> its own rc=0, and the peak is printed beside the clock with oom_kill=0.
#   3  THE SCOPE IS THE RULED ONE, read from inside: memory.max == the cap, memory.swap.max == 0, OOMPolicy=continue.
#   4  ONE SCOPE, NOT TWO: a runner nested inside the scope stays in the same cgroup.
#   5  A RED STAYS A RED: a runner exiting 1 with no kill exits 1; a non-cgroup SIGKILL passes through as 137, not a refusal.
#   6  OOMPolicy=continue IS LOAD-BEARING: under the default policy the supervisor dies with its scope (SIGTERM, rc 143).
#   7  THE HARNESS grades a program the cgroup killed UNPROVEN with the kill named, and a self-inflicted SIGKILL still CRASH.
#   8  THE BLOCKING SET refuses an arm whose window saw a cgroup kill and still reds an arm that simply failed.
#   9  THE ROW WRITER writes no row over a run a cgroup kill cut, and the scratch board stays byte-unchanged.
#  10  THE WIRING, live: a real board runner (under the inert probe seat) and an ADMITTED harness run over a corpus suite (an inert
#      fixture seat, no binary: it refuses before grading) each stand inside the scope; run_blocking_set.sh enters it on the real
#      declaration (read, not run: a gate may not run make test).
#   (A verb that never calls the guard is not a board and is not scoped: scorecard_snobol4.sh oracle's last line is a protocol line
#   util_ref_mint.sh parses, and test_gate_ref_cutters_refuse_a_dead_oracle.sh reds if a supervisor line ever lands after it.)
#   R  REPORTED (printed, cannot fail the gate, needs free swap): MemorySwapMax=0 is load-bearing -- under MemoryMax alone the
#      same over-cap allocation succeeds by swapping.
# Fail-once/pass-once receipt: the Makefile line that wires this gate.
