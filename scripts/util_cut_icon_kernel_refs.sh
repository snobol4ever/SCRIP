# CEO-609 ruling that a kernel or demo WITHOUT a ref is owed A REF -- cut from iconx and recorded --
# never absorption into the master (CEO-565 forbids a second copy; benchmarks/ and demos/ are the only

#
# ⛔⭐⭐ WHY THIS IS NOT util_cut_icon_ipl_refs.sh WITH A --dir, AND WHY THAT IS NOT A FORK (hq_V
# 2026-09-12). That script is the same TAXONOMY and a DIFFERENT ISOLATION CONTRACT, and only the second
# half is what binds it to its tree: it builds one template from the six IPL subdirectories
# (progs/gprogs/procs/gprocs/incl/gincl), takes `--dir` as ONE package-relative subdirectory name and
# REFUSES a path with a slash, walks that one directory FLAT (`ls -1 *.icn`), and reads its rulings from
# $PKG/UNGRADABLE.tsv. Every one of those is correct for a vendored flat package and wrong here:
# benchmarks/icon has three subdirectories (rate/, rtx/, shootout/), its link modules sit BESIDE the
# programs that link them rather than in a procs/ library, and demos/icon/jcon links UPWARD out of its
# own tree into ../../../packages/icon/jcon-compiler/. ⭐ What IS shared is shared BY SOURCING, never by
# restating: lib_icn_rundir.sh (THE ONE AUTHORITY for the run-directory contract -- stdin, argv,
# NAME.fixtures/, env) and lib_oracle_flags.sh (THE ONE authority on oracle selection). The eight
# outcome names below are deliberately spelled the same as that script's so one reader can read both
# censuses; if either taxonomy ever grows a class, the other is owed the same class.
#
# ⛔⛔ EVERY RUN IS SANDBOXED IN A DISPOSABLE COPY, NEVER THE TRACKED TREE -- the same hazard that renamed
# 275 vendored IPL sources to UPPERCASE in place when its cutter first used the real directory as cwd.
# The kernel trees carry the identical shape: geddump/tgrlink/ipxref open files named on argv or read
# their own neighbourhood, and `icont` itself writes NAME.u1/NAME.x beside the source it is handed.
# ⭐ THE TEMPLATE EXCLUDES *.s: the two trees are 18M+9.4M with the .s artifacts and 1.2M without them,
# and nothing in a run reads an artifact. A per-run copy is then cheap enough to be unconditional, which
# is the only way an isolation rule survives contact with a 51-file walk.
#
# ⛔⭐ THE TEMPLATE IS PRE-TRANSLATED ONCE, BECAUSE `link` IS RESOLVED AT LINK TIME AGAINST NAME.u1 AND
# NOTHING IN THE CORPUS SHIPS ONE (doc/files.htm + man/man1/icont.1: `link X` resolves to `X.u1`, cwd
# first then $IPATH; `icont -c a.icn` stops after translation and leaves a.u1 behind, and "a directory of
# such files functions as a linkable library"). Six benchmarks link options/post/shuffle and four jcon
# demos link seventeen modules under packages/icon/jcon-compiler, so a cutter that skips this step
# reports ORACLE_FAIL on ten programs and calls it a defect of the corpus.
#
# ⛔ A .ref MINTED FROM A RUN THAT IS NOT A GENUINE CLEAN EXECUTION PINS A LIE, so every walked file gets
# exactly ONE NAMED outcome and never a silent skip:
#   MODULE         -- no `procedure main` and no `link` that could supply one. A library module is not a
#                     kernel, is never run alone, and is NEVER owed a ref (options/post/shuffle).
#   HAS_REF        -- a NAME.ref already sits beside it. Owes nothing (CEO-609).
#   WRAPPER_IN_KERNEL / TIMING_IN_KERNEL -- CEO-567 CLAUSE 1 UNMET, in its two shapes. WRAPPER_IN_KERNEL:
#                     the source links `post` or calls Init__/Term__ -- the 1993 Icon benchmarking
#                     wrapper is LINKED INTO the kernel and prints the oracle's version string, the
#                     HOSTNAME, &features, elapsed time and storage/collection counts TO STDOUT, mixed
#                     with the program's own output -- and reassigns `write`/`writes` to suppress that
#                     output entirely unless $OUTPUT is set. That is exactly the defect CEO-567 outlawed
#                     (clauses 1 and 2), and while it stands clause 3 is UNREACHABLE: a ref cut from
#                     that stream pins implementation identity no other engine can reproduce. Named as
#                     OWED with its cause, never minted. TIMING_IN_KERNEL: the source calls a timing
#                     builtin (&time/&clock/&now) ITSELF and writes the reading to stdout -- the same
#                     defect SCRIP-authored rather than inherited, and RULES.md's enforcement clause names
#                     it in those words ("no source in it calls a timing or iteration builtin").
#                     ⛔ BOTH are keyed on the DECLARATION (the link, the calls), never on the shape of the
#                     bytes, so a cured kernel leaves the class by being cured and not by a pattern moving.
#                     ⭐⭐ AND THE STRUCTURAL CHECK WAS ADDED ONLY AFTER THE RUN-TWICE ARM FOUND THE SAME
#                     FILES EMPIRICALLY: the first census of these trees reported the fourteen &time
#                     kernels as NONDETERMINISTIC, which is TRUE and is the canary. The structural class
#                     replaces a symptom with its cause; it does not replace the canary, and the
#                     NONDETERMINISTIC arm below is deliberately left intact so that deleting this check
#                     degrades the report rather than silencing it.
#   EMPTY          -- rc=0 and zero bytes of stdout. A 0-byte ref grades "produced nothing" as correct.
#   ORACLE_FAIL    -- rc!=0 and no named class below explains it. The row carries THE ORACLE'S OWN FIRST
#                     NON-BLANK LINE as its reason, never a sentence this script composed.
#   TIMEOUT        -- exceeded $TIMEOUT (an interactive read, or a genuinely long run).
#   UNDECLARED_IDENTIFIER -- an identifier never resolved at link time, checked at ANY rc: this oracle is
#                     built without graphics, so a program reaching a missing name may warn and stop
#                     (rc=0) or die calling through it (error 106).
#   OVERSIZED      -- stdout exceeds $MAX_BYTES, checked with `wc -c` ON THE FILE before it is ever
#                     slurped into a shell variable (a program that is not quiet while it times out can
#                     print gigabytes before `timeout` kills it).
#   SUSPECT_USAGE  -- rc=0, non-empty, and the first line reads like a usage/error banner printed on a
#                     clean exit. A program that prints "usage: prog file" and exits 0 would otherwise
#                     pin its own complaint as ground truth. Named for a human to eyeball, never LIVE.
#   NONDETERMINISTIC -- run TWICE in independent fresh rundirs; the two stdouts disagree. Pinning either
#                     would fail the other forever. ⭐ This is the arm that catches benchmarks/icon/rate/*
#                     by construction: those nine are the WRAPPED form, not a kernel -- they read &time
#                     inside the program and write "<units> <elapsed_ms> <checksum>", so two of the three
#                     fields are machine-dependent by design. Their own headers say the CHECKSUM is the
#                     cross-engine correctness datum; extracting one field from a run is a MASK, this
#                     script does not invent one, and the row says so.
#   IMPLEMENTATION_IDENTITY -- a clean, stable, non-empty run whose OUTPUT contains the oracle's own version
#                     string or the host name. Pinning it makes the one oracle the correct answer. Wants a
#                     mask or an outside-baseline ruling, never a byte ref. See the long note at
#                     IDENT_PATTERNS for the measurement and for why the test is on the output.
#   LIVE           -- rc=0 both runs, non-empty, byte-identical across the two, no usage banner, no
#                     undeclared identifier. Minted as NAME.ref with --apply; otherwise "would mint".
#
# ⛔⭐ A KERNEL ALREADY RULED UNGRADABLE IS NEVER A MINT CANDIDATE. This script walks the TREE and a
# ruling lives in a FILE BESIDE the tree, so without reading it the next --apply SILENTLY UN-RULES a
# decision a human made, with no diff to show it was overturned. Each root may carry UNGRADABLE.tsv
# whose first tab-separated column is the root-relative path of a kernel a ref is the wrong instrument
# for; those rows are reported RULED_UNGRADABLE and skipped at mint time whatever the run says.
#
# ⛔ THE SHOOTOUT FIVE ARE SKIPPED BY DEFAULT AND THE SKIP IS PRINTED, NEVER SILENT (CEO-609: "The
# shootout five stay the cfo's row and become kernel-with-ref when it lands; the census counts them until
# then and that is honest"). --no-skip-shootout walks them anyway for whoever holds that row.
#
# rc=0 nothing owed and uncut · rc=1 naming what is still owed · rc=2 the instrument cannot measure.

# ⛔⭐⭐ THE IDENTITY PATTERNS A REF MAY NEVER CONTAIN, AND WHY THE TEST IS EMPIRICAL AND NOT STRUCTURAL
# (hq_V 2026-09-12, caught by scanning the eighteen refs this script had just minted -- which is the only
# reason it was caught). benchmarks/icon/version.icn is four lines whose whole body is `write(&version)`, so
# its run is a CLEAN, DETERMINISTIC, non-empty, banner-free success and every arm below passed it: the ref
# minted was the single line "Icon Version 9.5.25a, September 7, 2025". That pins THE ORACLE'S OWN IDENTITY
# as the correct answer -- SCRIP prints its own version and can never match it, and the pin moves the day the
# oracle is rebuilt. ⛔ THE SAME CLASS IS ALREADY ON THE RECORD IN THE ICON MASTER: procedure_every_alt_
# replace_4 is a keyword dump whose diff is entirely `&version: Jcon 2.2` vs `Icon 9.5`, `&allocated`,
# `&regions`, `&storage` and `&progname`, and it needs a mask or an outside-baseline ruling rather than a
# re-cut (GOAL-HQ-VALIDATE HQV-18). A cutter aimed at a NEW tree inherits that blindness unless told, and

# ⛔ THE TEST IS ON THE OUTPUT, NOT ON THE SOURCE, because the structural version over-refuses and the
# over-refusal is not cheap: benchmarks/icon/tgrlink.icn mentions &progname SEVEN times -- every one of them

# (zero hits). Refusing it on the grep would have withheld a good ref from a 256 KB deterministic program on

    # the program calls through the missing name and dies (error 106). Here the cause can be an ordinary
    # missing `local`, which Icon resolves as a global and `-u` merely WARNS about. MEASURED on
    # demos/icon/demo/icon_parser.icn ("nl": undeclared identifier, procedure p_global): translated and run
    # BOTH WAYS, `icont -s -u` and `icont -s`, the executable links in both and the two runs are
    # BYTE-IDENTICAL -- so the warning never touched the answer, and reporting it as the outcome denied a
    # perfectly good program a ref on the strength of a diagnostic about nothing. ⭐ The evidence is NOT
    # thrown away: it still preempts when the run also failed or produced nothing, which is every case
    # where it could actually be the cause, and the reason column still carries the oracle's own words.
