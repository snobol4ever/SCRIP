# test_gate_sno_a_bare_fence_as_an_alternation_arm_matches_null_and_seals_its_backtrack.sh -- a bare FENCE reached as an arm of an
# alternation matches the null string, and backtracking into it fails the WHOLE match (no later arm, no later start position), in both
# modes, statically compiled and inside EVAL alike, as SPITBOL answers it.
#
# ⛔ THE DEFECT (row snobol4-a-bare-fence-as-an-alternation-arm-recurses-until-the-stack-overflows, found by Lon's infinite_snobol4 at
#   expression 189 'z' ? ANY('xyz') POS(3) | FENCE). sno_pat_node lowered a bare FENCE (TT_FENCE, no argument) to NO node -- it returned
#   its own continuation. TT_ALT lowers each arm with the alternation box itself as that continuation, so the FENCE arm's entry WAS the
#   alternation (--dump-ir: MATCH_ALTERNATE [29,29,6,6] at slot 6): taking the arm re-entered the alternation, which re-tried every arm
#   at the same cursor, forever -- ERROR 246 (stack overflow) in both modes. sbl -bf matches the null string. A bare FENCE inside a
#   sequence (TT_SEQ builds its own IR_MATCH_FENCE0) and a whole-pattern FENCE never reached that return, so they always agreed.
# THE CURE: a bare FENCE reached as a standalone pattern node builds the IR_MATCH_FENCE0 (SNO_FENCE_LIT_BARE) box the sequence path
#   builds, its omega on the enclosing pat_seal as ABORT's is.
# MONITOR BRACKET (the row's witness, monitor_run.sh --oracle): step 1 agrees; step 2 spl reaches LABEL stno=2, scr has died inside
#   statement 1's match (ERROR 246). After the cure AGREE=6 DIVERGE=0 UNGRADED=0.
#
# THE ARMS (expectations cut from sbl -bf AT RUN TIME):
#   1-2  m3 / m4 STATIC: the diverging shapes -- FENCE as the last, middle and only-matching arm, an arm whose backtrack must seal the
#        match, the generator's expression 189                                                                 -- RED on base
#   3-4  m3 / m4 EVAL: the same shapes, one per line, EVALed                                                    -- RED on base
#   5-6  CONTROL m3 / m4: shapes base already answers -- a whole-pattern FENCE, FENCE in a sequence, FENCE('') / ARB / ABORT / FLUSH
#        as the arm
# EXIT: 0 all arms pass · 1 an arm failed · 2 REFUSED (no binary, no oracle, no tmpdir).
