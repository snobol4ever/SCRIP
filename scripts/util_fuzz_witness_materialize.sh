# util_fuzz_witness_materialize.sh — rebuild row `fuzz-nondeterminism-rootcause`'s 5-witness set into ONE
# directory, so util_fuzz_witness_stability.sh / util_fuzz_witness_predicate_ladder.sh have something to
# point FUZZ_DIR at.  Prints the directory path on stdout (and nothing else on stdout), so it composes:
#     FUZZ_DIR="$(bash scripts/util_fuzz_witness_materialize.sh)" bash scripts/util_fuzz_witness_stability.sh
#
# ⛔⭐ WHY THIS EXISTS — THE ROW'S WITNESSES STOPPED BEING FILES AND ITS INSTRUMENTS DID NOT NOTICE.
# Both instruments defaulted FUZZ_DIR to corpus/tests/snobol4/probe_loose/fuzz.  The one-flat-suite
# cutover (corpus c06960a1, Lon 2026-08-29 total-conversion ruling) DELETED that directory: 4 of the 5
# witnesses were absorbed into the master suite as XFAIL block entries under NEW names, and only the
# 5th (fz_red_m4b, explicitly held out in ALL.excluded.txt) survives as a loose pair.  The instruments
# refused correctly (rc=2 "witness dir missing") rather than reporting an empty set as stable — the law
# working — but a refusal is not a measurement, and the row was left with NO instrument at all.
# ⭐ The witnesses did not become unavailable, only unreachable BY PATH: `corpus_suite_harness.py extract`
# reproduces each absorbed entry exactly.  This script is that recipe, so the next session runs one
# command instead of rediscovering the rename.
#
# ⛔ THE ENTRY NAMES ARE DERIVED FROM ALL.csv, NEVER HARDCODED.  Absorption renamed every witness
# (fz_segv_09 -> fence_pos_len_replace_branch_2, and so on); a hardcoded list would rot at the next
# rename exactly the way the FUZZ_DIR default just did.  ALL.csv's `family` column still carries the
# pre-absorption origin, so the mapping is recoverable from the corpus itself.  ⛔ Extraction goes
# through the harness's own `extract` verb and never through hand-copied text: seat11 measured that
# hand-retyped copies of these witnesses give a FALSE-CLEAN signal.
#
# EXIT: 0 = all 5 materialized · 2 = REFUSE, could not materialize the full set (an incomplete witness
# set is not a smaller witness set, it is a DIFFERENT experiment — this row has already been misled once
# by a set whose membership was not what the reader believed).
