# ceo CEO-1011 / TENET condition 1, hardened on Lon's challenge 2026-09-20).
#
# ⛔ WHAT THIS GATE EXISTS FOR, AND WHY NO EXISTING INSTRUMENT SEES IT. The ceo measured hq_snobol4's nine-line
# witness at SCRIP_HEAP_MB=1: four of seven stress points RETURN A WRONG ANSWER, SILENTLY, EXIT 0, NO DIAGNOSTIC.
# Every rc-shaped census reads GREEN over that class -- and so does a pass TOTAL, because a board that loses one
# entry and gains another reads identical (the swap, GOAL-TEST-SUITE-CONSISTENCY's per-entry-identity lesson).
# So this gate grades BY ORACLE DIFF, PER ENTRY, NEVER BY rc AND NEVER BY A TOTAL: it runs the Prolog master
# once per ARM on ONE binary and NAMES every (entry, mode) pair whose outcome MOVED against the control arm.
#
# ⛔⭐ TWO AXES, BECAUSE ONE AXIS READS GREEN OVER THE CLASS -- hq_snobol4 measured this and sent it to me
# 2026-09-20, and it was a hole in this gate's FIRST cut, which varied the arena alone. Their witness is
# byte-equal to its ref at stress 0 and wrong from stress>=1, IN BOTH MODES, AT BOTH ARENAS: the band moves with
# the POLL SET, not the window. Confirmed in the mechanism rather than taken on trust -- gc_heap.c
# c_rt_gcheap_alloc reads SCRIP_GC_STRESS once into a static and raises g_gc_pending every N allocations, so it
# is orthogonal to window size, and UNSET MEANS ZERO FORCED COLLECTIONS. A gate that pins the arena, leaves the
# poll set unset and prints "tiny arena" certifies half of what a reader will take it to mean.
#   ARM control  : shipped window, no forced collection  -- the baseline every other arm is diffed against
#   ARM arena    : SCRIP_HEAP_MB=1                       -- does a SMALL WINDOW change an answer
#   ARM stress:N : SCRIP_HEAP_MB=1 + SCRIP_GC_STRESS=N   -- does COLLECTING OFTEN change an answer, one arm per N
#
# ⛔⭐⭐ A STRESS BAND, NEVER A STRESS POINT -- ceo CEO-1024, 2026-09-20, and it retired MY OWN first number.
# hq_raku ran the raku master at SCRIP_HEAP_MB=1 SCRIP_GC_STRESS=16 on the same tree and same binary as two
# green arms: m3 853 -> 817, m4 853 -> 824. SIXTY-FIVE GRADINGS LOST, ZERO GAINED, THIRTY-SIX DISTINCT
# PROGRAMS, every one exit 0 with no diagnostic and a plausible wrong answer, every one MATCHING at stress 0.
# The fleet had been grading at 1, 3 and 5 and calling that clean. ⛔ THE RULING: if your lane is clean at 1, 3
# and 5 you have not measured your lane, YOU HAVE MEASURED THE BAND.
# ⭐ AND THE JUDGEMENT ERROR IS WORTH MORE THAN THE NUMBER, because it is the one a careful seat makes: this
# gate's first cut used STRESS_N=8, picked as the top of hq_snobol4's measured red band {1,2,4,8}. Choosing the
# plant from where the KNOWN defects were is choosing a band that ENDS WHERE THE DEFECTS START -- evidence-based
# in feel and circular in fact. A single point cannot answer "is there a divergence point above this one", and
# that is the only question worth asking. So the band ASCENDS and the gate reports WHERE the divergence point
# is, rather than whether one chosen plant happened to sit on it.
#
# ⛔ A TIMEOUT IS NOT A DIVERGENCE AND THIS GATE REFUSES RATHER THAN GUESSING. Under stress=1 a correct program
# can run two orders of magnitude slower; an rc=124 cannot distinguish "needs 8.1s" from "never finishes". So
# the stress arm raises the harness per-program TIMEOUT, and any pair whose ONLY movement is into HANG is
# reported as INCONCLUSIVE and REFUSES rc=2 -- never counted as a collector defect, and never quietly dropped
# to keep the gate green. A clean this gate could not measure is not a clean.
#
# ⛔ NOT IN `make test`, ON PURPOSE, AND DO NOT WIRE IT THERE. Three full master boards is ~3x a single board,
# and TENET condition 2 is that the blocking set is the shared resource that does not scale with seats (367
# serial arms, essentially serial, one 16-core box, ten seats queueing). This is a DELIBERATE gate: the owning
# row runs it, and a landing claiming Prolog's GC share is clean cites its output.
#
# ⛔ REFUSES rc=2 RATHER THAN REPORTING A CLEAN IT COULD NOT MEASURE: no binary, no suite, an arm that printed
# no SUITE_BOARD line, two arms whose entry sets differ, or an inconclusive HANG. A short count is never a green
# here -- the whole failure mode this gate is built against is a plausible wrong answer at exit 0.

# tiny arena NEVER COLLECTS over it, and the board prints arena_mb=1 in its verdict line while meaning nothing by
# it. Their general form: A SUITE-TABLE CELL THAT NAMES THE ARENA IS NOT THEREBY A READING OF THE COLLECTOR -- a

# unlabelled number invites a question and a labelled one closes it.
