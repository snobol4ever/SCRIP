# .s artifact beside every benchmark .pl in corpus/benchmarks/prolog/bench.
#
# Mirrors util_regen_benchmark_s_artifacts.sh (SNOBOL4). Per RULES.md the .s is
# the HONEST CURRENT compiler output, never a pinned golden:
#   - a program that compiles to real x86 -> its .s is (re)written and, if the
#     bytes changed, committed.
#   - a program still FENCED by pl_gz_admit (no codegen yet) -> NO .s; instead a
#     one-line <name>.s.FENCED marker records the frontier honestly. When the
#     ladder admits that shape, the regen replaces the marker with a real .s.
#   - an assembler-rejected .s is left flagged, not silently committed.
# scrip --compile is deterministic, so an unchanged compiler yields no change.
