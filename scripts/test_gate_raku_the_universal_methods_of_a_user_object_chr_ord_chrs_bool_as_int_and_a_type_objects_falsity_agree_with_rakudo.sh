# test_gate_raku_the_universal_methods_of_a_user_object_chr_ord_chrs_bool_as_int_and_a_type_objects_falsity_agree_with_rakudo.sh -- THE MU / ANY METHODS OF A USER OBJECT, chr / ord / chrs IN UTF-8, A Bool AS AN INTEGER, A TYPE OBJECT IS FALSE, AND A ZERO-ITEM push
# (row raku-every-suite-to-100-under-nonet-ceo-1266; found by a 120-file mode-3 Roast sample: 10 of 120 died "GZ-10 rt_call_proc_descr: procedure 'Foo__defined' has no stackless slab", then a probe of 50 universal methods on a plain class).
#
# THE DEFECTS, each measured against Rakudo: (1) a method the class does not define fell through to a procedure that does not exist, so $obj.defined, .Bool, .so, .not, .gist, .Str, .raku, .item, .self, .list, .elems, .head ... all died on EVERY user class
# (only .isa and .WHAT worked); and say $obj printed "Foo" where Rakudo prints Foo.new(x => 1, y => "a") (public attributes in declaration order); (2) .chr truncated to one byte (8364.chr printed a byte, chr(8364) too), .ord read one byte ("é".ord was 195,
# "€".ord 226), 5.ord and chrs(...) / .chrs did not exist; (3) True.Int was 0, so (1 == 1).Int + 1 was 1; True.Num and .Numeric printed nothing; 5.Numeric did not exist; (4) a type object was TRUE in all four truthiness entries (Int ?? "T" !! "F" gave T,
# so Int gave True); (5) push / append / prepend / unshift with no items died "error 22: undefined function called" (the *_pure arm wanted two arguments).
# THE CURE (by_name_dispatch.c, lower_raku.c): rk_mu_method answers the Mu / Any methods of an instance whose class does not define them, tried in meth_call just before the doomed procedure call; rk_obj_default_raku renders Name.new(attr => value, ...) from the public
# attributes and is the gist of an object, also inside a list, array or hash (rk_gist_str); rk_utf8_put encodes chr, ord decodes a code point and takes a non-string receiver, chrs joins a list; a Bool becomes an Int for Int / Num / Numeric / Real / abs; Numeric and Real are the
# identity on a number; rk_typeobj_name makes a type object false in rk_is_truthy, __rk_bool, __rk_bool_val and __rk_mkbool; the *_pure arm accepts a bare array; the function forms chr, ord, chrs join the lowerer's function-form table.
# NOT HERE (own rows, measured): `if $obj` takes the else branch in mode 4 for one shape (class Foo {} + class Bar { has $.x; has $.y; has $!p; method m } + `my $f = Foo.new; my $b = Bar.new; if $b {...}`; true in mode 3 and on the base build, so not from this landing); a user class's
# type object is still true (`Foo ?? 1 !! 0`) and prints Foo where Rakudo prints (Foo); attributes of a base class print before the subclass's (Rakudo: subclass first); `has @.tags` keeps a List where Rakudo has an Array; [+] over Bools; True.sum.
#
# THE WITNESS, graded in m3 (--run) and m4 (--compile + link) against a ref cut by Rakudo (/usr/bin/raku), then under SCRIP_GC_STRESS 1 3 5 in both modes.
# FAILED ONCE, measured on SCRIP 084148a1e before the cure: every witness-mode pair red.
#
# EXIT: 0 every witness matches in both modes; 1 a mismatch or a crash on a witness; 2 REFUSED (stale binary, no gcc).
