# test_gate_pl_a_run_time_compile_indexes_the_root_cells_through_the_roots_registry.sh -- A CLAUSE COMPILED AT RUN TIME NAMES THE SAME ROOT CELLS AS THE PROGRAM.
# hq_prolog 2026-10-04, row prolog-bb-a-run-time-compile-indexes-the-root-cells-through-the-roots-registry-never-a-fresh-compile-time-table
# (ARCH-PROLOG-C-OUT-OF-THE-BOX.md section 5.3). On origin a clause compiled at run time (an asserted clause's packet fragment, a meta-call
# wrapper) numbered the root cells it named -- a dynamic predicate's packet, a global variable's cell -- from a fresh compile-time table whose
# indices start at 0, so an asserted clause's nb_setval wrote another predicate's packet cell (core/test_arith.pl under the SWI shim SIGSEGVed
# in both modes; gdb watchpoint on pj_test/4's cell). Now every run-time compile resolves a name through the ROOT'S REGISTRY (cell 0 of the
# standing frame: rt_pl_db_cell_for finds the bound cell or allocates the next free one), the $db_decls table is emitted from the lowerer's
# FINAL state so every compile-time key and predicate is registered before main runs, a run-time ownership test reads the registry, the stale
# compile-time clause shortcuts are off inside a run-time compile, and a global-variable key that is an atom only at run time (a meta-called
# nb_setval) resolves through the same registry. The witnesses also pin the is/2 cold road's bind (found on the way: after the evaluator call
# the bind read its value through a register the call had clobbered).
# ARMS: three witnesses vs swipl in m3 AND m4 -- (1) root cells: two declared dynamics, an asserted clause's nb_setval and nb_getval, a
# meta-called nb_setval, a key first used at run time, a b_setval with a variable key; (2) fragments: an asserted clause calling a static
# predicate, an arithmetic one, a dynamic one it extends, and an undefined one under catch; (3) is/2 through the evaluator (cold road) in
# four shapes. The expected text is the oracle's, cut with /usr/bin/swipl -q -t halt at gate-writing time.
# RED BEFORE on origin 2fa1fcd5c: witness 1 answers existence_error(variable, z) in m4 and refuses the meta-called key in both modes;
# witness 3's second line faulted in m3 for the SWI shim's shape.
