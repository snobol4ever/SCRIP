# ⛔⭐⭐ NEGATIVE-ARM GATE for the ROWD-CLOSE guard in s4e_msg.sh (row done-must-hand-off-manifest-cited-rows, CEO-69 batch 5a + CEO-70).
# THE DEFECT IT PINS: closing a row cited as ROWD evidence in corpus_coverage_manifest.tsv reds `make test` for EVERY seat
# until the manifest is re-pointed by hand. THREE identical fleet-wide reds in one day before the guard existed.
# ⛔ THIS GATE DRIVES THE REAL `done` PATH end-to-end in a scratch world (S4E_HOME/S4E_POST/S4E_SEAT are all overridable) --
# it does NOT test a helper in isolation. A guard proven only through its own helper is not proven through the path that ships.
# ⛔ REFUSES rc=2 when it cannot measure. A test that cannot fail is indistinguishable from one that passed.
