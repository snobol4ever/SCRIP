# test_gate_icn_byname_generator_region_is_not_on_the_arena.sh -- A BY-NAME ICON GENERATOR DELIVERS ITS
# SEQUENCE FROM ITS OWN COROUTINE STACK, IN BOTH MEDIA (SCRIP 0981d75df: "carve the by-name generator's
# region on its own coroutine stack, not the ZLS arena").
#
# ⛔ WHAT THIS GATE USED TO DO AND WHY IT HAD TO CHANGE (COO-80, 2026-09-19, row
# instrument-the-nineteen-non-gc-blocking-arms, CEO-944/949). It ran each witness with SCRIP_ZETA_TELEM=1,
# captured 2>&1 into one string, stripped the lines beginning `[ZLS]`, compared the remainder to "1 2 3" and
# RED if any `[ZLS]` line survived -- an activation served from the ZLS arena. TWO SEPARATE THINGS HAVE SINCE
# GONE WRONG WITH THAT, and it read RED for every seat with the compiler behaving perfectly:
#
#   (1) ⛔ THE ZLS ARM IS A RETIRED CRITERION, MEASURING A DELETED INSTRUMENT. SCRIP 74010795d (CEO-448/454,
#       Lon: "get rid of all that ZLS and ZETA #define's") DELETED the arena itself -- zeta_alloc.c gone, the
#       never-pushed zls2 arena and the collector's chain walk gone, every ZC_/ZLS_ name gone. NOTHING UNDER
#       src/ HAS PRINTED A `[ZLS]` LINE SINCE, so that count has been structurally 0 and the arm could not
#       have failed whatever the compiler did: a green over an empty measurement, which is the shape this
#       tree refuses everywhere else. The property it stood for did not go with it -- it became a SOURCE
#       property, held by test_gate_no_zeta_frame_switches.sh (zero ZC_/ZLS identifiers and no rt_zls store
#       symbol under src/). This gate does NOT restate that census; it REFUSES rc=2 if that holder is gone,
#       so the property cannot quietly lose both its keepers at once.
#
#   (2) THE OUTPUT ARM WAS A STALE FIXTURE. Folding stderr into stdout and stripping ONE known prefix means
#       any new stderr instrument reds the gate, and one arrived: SCRIP_ZETA_TELEM gained a second consumer
#       in rt_gcheap_report (gc_heap.c), whose `[ZHP] arena=512MB blocks=... verify=OK` line landed in the
#       compared body and made all four witnesses read `output [1 2 3 [ZHP] ...] != 1 2 3`. The witness was
#       correct in every one of those runs. ⭐ THE CURE IS THE STREAMS, NOT A SECOND PREFIX: the criterion is
#       about the PROGRAM'S STDOUT, so stdout is captured and graded on its own and stderr is kept beside it
#       for the failure report. A prefix filter would have to be extended by every future instrument; this
#       does not. SCRIP_ZETA_TELEM is no longer set here at all -- it was only ever on to make the retired
#       `[ZLS]` line appear, and it is what dragged `[ZHP]` in.
#
# WHAT IS LEFT IS A REAL BEHAVIOURAL WITNESS AND IT STILL EARNS ITS PLACE: byname is the cured path (p := gen;
# every x := p()), direct is the control that was always on the stack, each in mode 3 and mode 4, and a
# regression in the by-name region carve shows up as a wrong sequence, a crash or a hang in the byname pair
# while direct stays clean.
# rc 0 green · 1 red · 2 could not measure.
