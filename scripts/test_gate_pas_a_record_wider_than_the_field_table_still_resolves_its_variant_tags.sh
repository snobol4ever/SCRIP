#
# MEASURED 2026-09-13 by the coo on origin 6d384fd08, taking the P5 self-host row. Pascal-P5's compiler pcom.pas aborted
# the whole compiler with "FATAL emit_drive: IR op=5 ... REFUSED AT A GUARD -- emit.cpp:1600", the binop operand-slot
# guard. The ceo ruled (CEO-675) that a refusal sink is never the site of a cure and the guard names the WITNESS, not the
# bug; that ruling is what found this. Upstream: the Pascal lowerer's DEFAULT case turns any tree node it does not handle
# into a VALUELESS JUMP, silently, and a comparison built over one of those reaches the emitter with an operand that has
# no slot. The unhandled nodes were 38 raw field selections, and they were raw because of two frontend faults together:
#
#   1. PAS_FIELD_MAX was 32 and pas_pend_add DROPPED SILENTLY past it. P5's identifier record has about 35 fields.
#   2. A tagged variant part registers its tag AFTER the whole variant part is parsed, so every tag lands at the END of
#      the field list -- which is what put exactly the tags past the 32 cap. The three names that fell off were klass,
#      pfdeckind and pfkind, all three of them tags.
#
# Cure: the cap is 128 and an overflow now SAYS SO on stderr instead of dropping a field in silence. That is the whole
# cure and it is deliberately the smaller one. ⛔ MOVING THE TAG TO ITS OWN POSITION, which is where ISO 7185 6.4.3.3
# puts it, WAS TRIED AND REVERTED: it shifted every field after a tag by one and made the SCRIP-built Pascal-P4 compiler
# reject its own source with 105 errors where it had none, and CEO-589 forbids a cure that trades one program for
# another. The cap raise alone fixes P5's pcom and leaves P4 clean. The ordering is a separate row with the downstream
# assumption to find first. pascal.y keeps its 5 shift/reduce conflicts.
#
# ARMS: one program, both modes, byte-identical to fpc -Miso -- a record with 28 fixed fields and a NESTED tagged variant
# part, so the inner tag sits past the old cap; every fixed field written and summed, both tags written and read back by
# ord, a variant field under each tag, and the two tags compared. On the parent tree this witness DUMPS CORE at the
# emitter guard. FAIL_ONCE=1 corrupts the sum line to prove the diff arm trips.
