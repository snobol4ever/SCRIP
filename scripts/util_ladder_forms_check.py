"""util_ladder_forms_check.py -- every DECLARED form and pair has a WITNESS.

Lon 2026-09-04, in-chat to ceo, verbatim: "Make tasks to ensure a complete test ladder covering every feature in
isolation with variations and then combinations of features." A rung stopped being one witness and became a
FAMILY: one tiny witness per FORM the reference lists for that construct, then PAIRS combining it with the rungs
below. This is the instrument that says whether a language's ladder actually has them, and it is the blocking
row -- every per-language ladder DONE-WHEN refuses rc=2 until it can call this.

THE CENSUS SCHEMA (ceo, this row): RUNG CONSTRUCT REFERENCE FORMS PAIRS WITNESS_ORIGIN STATUS NOTE, in
corpus/tests/<lang>/config/LADDER.tsv. FORMS and PAIRS are slugs separated by '|', ';' or ',' -- the live
censuses use '|' and the ratified schema line names only the columns. A form's witness is any origin
in that language's ALL.csv matching ladder__<rung>_*_<form>; a pair's is ladder__<rung>_*_with_<lower>.

⛔⭐ IT BINDS COLUMNS BY NAME, NEVER BY POSITION, AND THE FOUR LIVE CENSUSES ARE WHY. Measured 2026-09-04 before
a line of this was written: pascal declares `RUNG CONSTRUCT ISO_7185_SECTION WITNESS STATUS`, icon and snobol4
declare `RUNG CONSTRUCT WITNESS_ORIGIN STATUS NOTE`, and rebus has NO HEADER LINE AT ALL -- four files, four
shapes, one nominal schema. Any index-based reader would have silently read pascal's ISO section as its
WITNESS_ORIGIN and reported a confident wrong answer. This is the same position-over-shape defect that cost
util_score_row.py a fleet-wide refusal and util_apply_score_grid.py a two-table splice, both cured today; the
third time it is written down as a rule rather than as a scar.

⛔⭐⭐ A CENSUS WITHOUT A FORMS COLUMN IS `NOT-IN-SCHEMA`, WHICH IS NEITHER PASS NOR FAIL. This is the whole
design risk of this checker and the reason it is stated before the code. Every ladder census on disk today
predates the amendment, so a checker that simply looked for missing witnesses would find NO declared forms, and
"zero declared, zero missing" reads as GREEN -- a vacuous pass over the exact gap the row exists to close, on
all seven languages at once, on the day it landed. Vacuity is the failure mode here, not strictness. So: zero
graded forms is a REFUSAL (rc=2), never a pass, and a census still on the old schema is reported by name as
owed work rather than counted as satisfied.

EXIT: 0 every declared form (and, under --phase all, every declared pair) has a witness; 1 something declared
has none; 2 REFUSED -- cannot measure (no census, no header, nothing graded).
