# -d -i -s -m -u the compiled binary's own runtime switches and a double dash ends them; the master harness writes the double dash
# before a program's argv in m4, and test_icon_ipl_suite.sh did not, so gprogs/cquilts' own "-i 5000" was read as a 4 KB heap
# window and the binary refused (rc=134) where iconx and m3 run it.
# ARMS: (a) the runner's m4 run writes -- before the program's argv (read off test_icon_ipl_suite.sh); (b) GREEN a planted unit
# given "-i 5000 -x" as its argv mints and matches in m3 and in m4 run with --; (c) the same m4 binary run WITHOUT -- does not
# reach the program's argv intact, so the separator is load-bearing; (d) RED a runner copy without -- fails arm (a).
