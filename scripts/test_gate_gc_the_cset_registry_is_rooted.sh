# test_gate_gc_the_cset_registry_is_rooted.sh -- THE INTERNED CSET BYTES ARE ON THE COLLECTED HEAP AND THE ONLY POINTER AT THEM LIVES IN THE ARENA.
# ⛔ THE MEASURED DEFECT (cfo 2026-09-18, found by re-auditing my own fourteen-holder list against "persistence is not reachability"):
# kw_cset_intern (keywords.c) allocates the canonical cset bytes with rt_ws_alloc -- the COLLECTED HEAP -- and stores the pointer into
# g_kw_cset_names[i].ptr, an entry in a ct_grow'd ARENA table. g_kw_cset_names is named nowhere outside keywords.c, keywords.c contained no
# gc walk at all, and NONE of the eight walks the root phase calls touched it. So the bytes were unmarked at every collection and the slot
# was never registered for update, which is the g_name_save shape one table over.
# ⛔ WITNESS, AND IT IS A WRONG ANSWER RATHER THAN A CRASH, WHICH IS WHY NO CRASH-SHAPED ARM WOULD EVER HAVE FOUND IT: an Icon cset UNION
# reads *c = 26 or 256 instead of 16, with a NUL inside the cset. Measured on origin at SCRIP ad42031a9 RED at stress 1,2,3,4,5,8,10 and
# GREEN at 0,15,20,30,50,100 -- a RAGGED BAND, so a two-point DONE-WHEN at 30 and 200 reads clean and banks the defect (CEO-807).
# THE CURE is kw_cset_gc_roots(), called from the root phase, visiting every entry's ptr and name through rt_gc_visit_raw -- which
# range-checks, so a registered pointer into the emitted string table is a safe no-op, and which calls gc_slot_reg so the slot is UPDATED
# when the block moves rather than merely marked.
# ⛔ THE FACT-RULE ARM IS WHY THIS GATE CANNOT BE GREENED THE WRONG WAY (the shape of the cfo's own reverted f62a33aed): it REQUIRES
# kw_cset_intern to still allocate from the COLLECTED HEAP. Moving the interned bytes to the arena or to libc would make the band green
# while taking the object out of the collector's sight, which is the same evasion as pinning it, one name further out.
