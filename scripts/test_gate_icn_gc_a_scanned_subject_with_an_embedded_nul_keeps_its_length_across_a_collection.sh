# DECTET; row icon-gc-g-scan-subj-ptr-is-not-relocated-so-rt-scan-subj-len-falls-back-to-strlen-and-loses-an-embedded-nul-length
# (ceo CEO-1152, named by the cfo at fa1dc84a5).
#
# WHAT WAS THERE, AND IT WAS TWO HOLDERS OF ONE ADDRESS AGAIN. rt_scan_subj_len() answers the scan subject's length from a cache
# keyed on the subject's ADDRESS (g_scan_subj_ptr / g_scan_subj_len). gen_gc_roots moved scan_subj at every collection and never
# the cache, so the first collection after a scan began left the key naming the pre-move address, the lookup missed, and the
# function fell back to strlen() -- which stops at an embedded NUL. A callee reading its caller's subject (it has no scan
# registers of its own) then saw *&subject = 2 and image(&subject) = "ab" for "ab\x00cdeee", rc=0, both modes, at every stress
# level including the shipped arena. Independently the by-name tab() arm measured the subject with strlen() and returned an
# unmeasured STRVAL even with no collection at all, so tab(0) in a callee read "b" and &pos 3.
#
# WHAT IS HERE. The cache is registered as a slot of its own when it aliases the subject at the collection (rt_gc_visit_raw
# fixes up every registered slot after the move -- assigning it from scan_subj right after the visit would copy the OLD
# address, which is what the first cut of this cure measured), and is left alone when it does not. Every writer of scan_subj
# sets the length -- the co-expression ScanState now carries it, the resets and the reenter paths set it, the empty subject is
# one shared object -- so the strlen() fallback is DELETED: a subject whose length was not carried is an internal error that
# aborts loudly, never a shorter answer. tab(), move() and pos() read the carried length and tab() returns it with BSTRVAL.
#
# ARMS. (1) STRUCTURE, both directions: rt_scan_subj_len has no strlen and aborts on a miss; gen_gc_roots registers the cache
# slot under the alias test; no strlen(scan_subj) is left anywhere under src/runtime. (2) BAND, both media: the witness matches
# its iconx-cut ref at stress 0,1,3,5 under SCRIP_GC_RELOC=1 in a 128 KB arena, and EVERY arm reports collections>0 from the
# run's own report. (3) NO COLLECTION: in a 64 MB arena the same witness matches in both media -- the tab() arm's own path.
