# test_gate_bb_label_no_silent_truncation.sh — THE PRISON for: A SYMBOL NAME IS NEVER SILENTLY TRUNCATED, AND
# EVERY SPELLING OF ONE SYMBOL IS THE SAME SPELLING.
#
# THE INVARIANT: two distinct source names must never become one symbol, and one source name must never become
# two. Both have happened:
#   (1) bb_label_t.name is a fixed BB_LABEL_NAME_MAX (80) byte field. A plain vsnprintf/strncpy into it dropped
#       whatever distinguished a long name, INCLUDING the alpha/beta/gamma/omega port suffix, so several boxes
#       emitted the SAME symbol and `as` rejected the file. Cured by SCRIP 32cce542: bb_label_name_set() keeps a
#       62-char prefix plus '$' and a 16-hex FNV-1a of the FULL name.
#   (2) bb_ab_sym_name() (src/templates/bb/bb_define.cpp), the mangler every procedure symbol passes through, cut
#       its output at 250 bytes with no disambiguator, so two predicates sharing 83 characters of name became one
#       symbol ("already defined"); and the procedure records in src/driver/scrip.c spelled FN__<name> with the
#       FULL mangled name while the definition went through the 80-byte field's hash, so a predicate whose name
#       mangles past 75 bytes was referenced under one spelling and defined under another and the mode-4 LINK
#       failed (undefined reference). Measured on e42ccddd2, 2026-10-01, by the cto. Cured the same day: the
#       mangler itself shortens a name past 48 bytes to its whole escape units up to 31 bytes, '$' and 16 hex of
#       the FNV-1a of the whole raw name, so every symbol built from it is short enough that the label field
#       never cuts it, and every definition and every text reference spell it the same way.
#
# WITNESS: a fixture this gate writes itself (it was corpus/programs/prolog/rung10_programs_puzzles.pl line 190,
# an unterminated symbolic atom at end of file that the Prolog parser now refuses exactly as swipl does, "190:121
# Syntax error: Unexpected end of file", so it emitted no long label and the gate read red on a witness that no
# longer exercised the class). Two pairs of predicates whose quoted names are '#' and a run of dashes:
#   pair A, 40 dashes: mangles to 129 bytes -- past the 80-byte label field, under the old 250 cut (class 2 link)
#   pair B, 120 dashes: mangles to 369 bytes -- past the old 250 cut, where a and b once collapsed (class 2 as)
# The program's answer is cut from swipl 9.0.4: [[1,2],[3],[4],[5]].
#
# THE LOCKS. A reintroduction must defeat all of them.
#   LOCK 0 (structural) — the label-field cure (bb_label_name_set) is present in emit.h.
#   LOCK 1 (structural) — no raw truncating write into a label name field survives in the emitter.
#   LOCK 2 (behavioral GREEN) — the witness compiles; (a) `as` accepts it; (b) every mangled label DEFINITION is
#       distinct, counted whether or not an instruction follows the colon on the same line; (c) it links and runs
#       in mode 4 and runs in mode 3, printing the oracle's answer in both.
#   LOCK 3 (fail-once RED) — the witness's names, mangled IN FULL by the pre-cure rule, collide under the old cuts:
#       pair A's two names agree on their first 79 bytes and pair B's on their first 250. LOCK 3 is what makes
#       LOCK 2 mean something: the witness is hard, so its distinctness in LOCK 2 is produced by the cure.
#
# PROOF STATUS: class 2 MEASURED RED on e42ccddd2 with the fixture by hand (pair A: undefined reference
# FN__$23$2D...b$2F1 at link; pair B: `as` "symbol ... is already defined") and GREEN after the mangler cure.
# For the full two-part proof against real codegen, build the pre-cure tree in a worktree and run this gate there
# with BBLBL_REVERT_ARM=1: it must print a red REVERT ARM line.
#
# ⛔ LATENT SIBLING, deliberately NOT asserted here: src/emitter/emit.cpp emit_label_intern() dedups by strcmp
# against the STORED name, so two interns of one over-long name still allocate two entries carrying one final
# name. No witness reaches it.
