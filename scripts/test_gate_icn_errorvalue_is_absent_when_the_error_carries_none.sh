# row icon-jcon-errors-red-both-modes-diagnosed-to-its-first-divergence-and-cured (errors.icn line 180, both copies).
#
# WHAT IT PINS. Icon has TWO independent facts after a converted error, and only one keyword is gated by each:
# "an error was recorded" gates &errornumber and &errortext, and "that error carried an OFFENDING VALUE" gates
# &errorvalue ALONE. An error raised without a value leaves &errorvalue FAILING -- not null, not the operand --
# and the fatal report for such an error prints no "offending value:" line. SCRIP already carries the mechanism:
# core_icn_error(code, FAILDESCR) means "no value", core_icn_report suppresses the line on DT_FAIL, and
# keywords.c returns the descriptor as-is so the read fails. Every always-value-less raise site in
# src/runtime/arithmetic.c already used it EXCEPT 206, which handed core_icn_error the left operand.
#
# ⭐ WHY ONE SITE OUT OF TWELVE IS THE WHOLE CLASS, and how the class was bounded without guessing. The
# authority is the oracle's OWN source, not a witness: `runerr(N)` with no second argument in
# /home/resources/icon-master/src/runtime/*.r is Arizona saying "this number carries no value". Twelve numbers
# are value-less at EVERY Arizona site (141 143 146 201 203 204 206 208 216 305 306 402) while 101/103/205
# appear both ways, so the property is per-SITE, not per-NUMBER, and a gate keyed on the number alone would be
# wrong for the very numbers it most wants to cover. Of our own sites for the always-value-less twelve, exactly
# two deviated: 206 (cured here) and 203 (NOT cured here -- it sits in the rt_big_* large-integer path, which is
# the cto's lane, and no witness for it exists on this tree; named, not taken).
#
# ⛔ THE OLD BEHAVIOUR IS INVISIBLE TO A DIFF THAT ONLY READS THE LAST RECORD. &errorvalue holds its previous
# value, so "the error carried no value" and "the error carried the value from an EARLIER error" render
# identically wherever a value-bearing error ran first. Arm STALE exists for exactly that: it raises 102 (which
# DOES carry "q"), then 206, and demands the read FAIL. Reading &errorvalue after the value-less error alone
# would have gone green on a build that simply never cleared it, if the program's first error happened to be
# value-less. Same family as the &errornumber trap in this row's baton.
#
# ⛔⭐ PROVENANCE, CORRECTED THE SAME SITTING AND LEFT HERE BECAUSE THE MISTAKE IS THE MORE USEFUL HALF.
# THE CURE IS THE cfo's `118fe2e4a`, NOT THIS GATE'S COMMIT. hq_C diagnosed 206 and cut the identical one-line
# change on a tree measured at `3e68226ea`; while that was being built and control-armed, the cfo landed
# `118fe2e4a` carrying the SAME line (plus the list()/reads() size gates), so `git pull --rebase` silently
# DROPPED hq_C's hunk as an already-applied patch and the commit that shipped this gate contains NO source
# change at all -- while its message still claimed the cure and a 57 -> 56 delta measured on the vanished tree.
# ⭐ THE REBASE-BASELINE COROLLARY IS USUALLY QUOTED FOR A/B NUMBERS; THIS IS ITS SHARPER FORM. A rebase that
# drops your patch is SILENT and looks exactly like a rebase that kept it: it is not a conflict, there is no
# warning, the build is green, the gate you wrote passes, and every arm you re-measure afterwards is TRUE --
# because someone else's identical cure is holding them up. The only instrument that separates "my change did
# this" from "my change is gone" is `git show <sha> --stat` on the pushed commit, read AFTER the push. Re-running
# the tests cannot do it, and re-running them is what diligence feels like.
# ⛔⛔ AND THE CORRECTION ABOVE ITSELF OVER-CORRECTED, WHICH IS THE THIRD LESSON AND THE ONE WORTH THE MOST.
# In retracting my numbers I also retracted a REAL defect: I had reported an m4-only crossing at errors.icn's
# last line, where the digits of `180` are split around `stop(&output,'testing stop')`'s output, and then wrote
# it off as an artifact of a mis-linked witness. It was NOT an artifact -- the run that first showed it was
# linked correctly with an absolute -L, the defect was genuinely on `3e68226ea`, and it was CURED by `e7e916e14`
# (stop() honours a leading file argument and flushes before exit) which arrived in the same rebase. A LATER,
# SEPARATE run of mine WAS mis-linked with a relative -L, and I let that one instrument fault explain away an
# observation it had nothing to do with. ⭐ ONCE YOU CATCH YOURSELF IN ONE INSTRUMENT ERROR, THE CHEAPEST STORY
# FOR EVERY OTHER SURPRISE IS THAT SAME ERROR -- and it is wrong exactly as often as it is right. A retraction
# needs its own evidence; "I was sloppy over there" is not evidence about over here. Attribute each observation
# to the run that produced it, and check what that particular run's command actually was.
# ⭐ WHAT IS ACTUALLY THIS SEAT'S IS WHAT YOU ARE READING: the class bounded from Arizona's own source rather
# than from the witness, the STALE arm below, and the fact that a cured behaviour with no gate is one refactor
# from being un-cured. `118fe2e4a` shipped the fix with no gate; this pins it in both modes against a freshly
# built oracle.
# ⛔ ARMS HASVALUE and NOVALUE_204 ARE CONTROLS THAT MUST NOT MOVE: a cure that made &errorvalue fail too eagerly
# would green the new arms and silently break every error that legitimately reports its operand -- which is most
# of them, and which is what errors.icn spends 500 lines checking.
