# bench_sno_rtx.sh — RTX GATE A/B MEASUREMENT RAIL (RTX-0b, s188).
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (the s188 finding): bench_sno_rail.sh measures the five *-match DEMOS, and those
# demos DO NOT EXERCISE ANY PORTED RTX FAMILY.  Measured at N=64 on claws5-match: rt_gcheap_alloc 2,
# str_concat_d 2, rt_subscript_var/rt_deref/rt_num_arith 0, rt_call_arr 8 AND FLAT from N=1 to N=64.
# RTX-1..RTX-7 could be perfect or deleted outright and that board would not move.  Running the rail
# for an RTX rung reports a FALSE NULL and invites the misreading "the asm did nothing" when the truth
# is "these programs never call the asm."  This harness measures programs that DO call it.
#
# WHAT IT MEASURES: the A/B that the RTX ladder actually needs is GATE ON vs GATE OFF on ONE binary
# (SCRIP_RTX_<FAM>=1 vs 0) — not scrip-vs-sbl.  Same source, same build, same machine, same moment;
# the only variable is which body runs.  That isolates the port and nothing else.
#
# DISCIPLINE INHERITED FROM bench_sno_rail.sh (2026-07-24 all-day variance postmortem):
#   - self-timing only.  15 of 16 corpus/benchmarks/snobol4 programs already print "ms: <n>" from a
#     TIME() delta, so process startup/link/compile are excluded EXACTLY.  No startup-floor estimate.
#   - ADEQUATE WINDOW OR NO RATIO.  Sub-800ms windows swung 1.4x-3.9x run to run.  Here that lesson is
#     a HARD GATE, not a footnote: a program whose median window is < MIN_MS is reported BOGUS-WINDOW
#     and its ratio is SUPPRESSED.  It is not quietly printed in small type.
#   - N auto-ranging x4 until the window is adequate, by scaling the program's dominant LT(VAR,INT)
#     loop bound (covers 8 of the 9 sub-threshold programs; guard below).
#   - R interleaved rounds (default 5), medians, per-round ON/OFF alternation to cancel drift.
#
# IT ALSO GATES CORRECTNESS FOR FREE: ON and OFF output (minus the ms: line) must be byte-identical.
# A ratio from a run whose two arms disagree is meaningless, so a mismatch is fatal, not a warning.
#
# ⛔ RT_OPT: per RULES.md O2-DIRECTED-ONLY, the runtime is built -O0 unless Lon directed otherwise.
# Every number this prints is labelled with RT_OPT so it is never silently compared against an
# optimized oracle.  This harness NEVER passes -O1/-O2 itself.
#
# usage: bench_sno_rtx.sh <FAMILY> [program ...]
#   FAMILY = MISC | ALLOC | STR | CALL | AGG | ARITH | NV | MATCH | PAT   (sets SCRIP_RTX_<FAMILY>)
#   with no programs, runs that family's MEASURED-hot set (see FAMSET below).

A warning in a comment does not disarm a default: anyone running `bench_sno_rtx.sh ARITH` with no program list still got the guaranteed false null. Annotating a broken instrument is not fixing it. ⚠ `rt_num_arith` REMAINS UNMEASURABLE by this set — it needs a mixed int/real program (RTX-0d); do not read an ARITH ratio here as evidence about rt_num_arith.
