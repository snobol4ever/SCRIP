# ROW: snocone-gc-the-snocone-share-of-the-unmapped-slot-population-censused-by-name-and-the-master-clean-under-forced-collection
# (hq_snocone, 2026-09-20, TENET CONDITION 1). ⛔ THIS GATE IS RED ON ORIGIN TODAY AND THAT IS THE POINT --
# `make test-arena` sweeps every scripts/test_gate_gc_*.sh and its own recipe says every RED here is a collector
# finding that owes a ROW. This one owes the row named above. Read the NAME, not the exit code, until it closes.
#
# THE DEFECT, minimal at two lines and NOT snocone-specific (measured 2026-09-20 by hq_snocone, handed to the cfo):
#     d = *1;                      EVAL of a DEFERRED EXPRESSION value returns the NULL STRING -- not a failure,
#     OUTPUT = EVAL(d);            not a crash, not a diagnostic -- when a collection lands inside EVAL's road.
# `sbl -bf` says 1. SCRIP says 1 with no collection and "" with one, rc=0 BOTH TIMES, and the statement SUCCEEDS
# (a `:F()` branch is not taken), so no conditional in any program can see it. The SNOBOL4 twin of the same two
# lines reproduces it identically, which is why the cure is a SHARED node and not this lane's to land.
#
# ⛔ THE ARENA IS NOT THE DISCRIMINATOR AND A TINY-ARENA-ONLY READING WOULD HAVE MISSED IT. It reproduces at the
# SHIPPED 512 MB arena too; what it needs is a collection at one particular allocation. SCRIP_GC_STRESS=1 is how
# this gate reaches that allocation cheaply -- stress 2,3,4,5,8 all answer CORRECTLY over the same program with
# the SAME number of collections, so the count of collections is not the discriminator either.
#
# ⛔ THE REF COMES FROM THE ORACLE AT GATE TIME, never from a pinned literal and never from our own output: the
# whole class is a plausible wrong answer, so a self-pinned ref would pin the wrong answer the day it regresses.
