# rung36_jcon_scan (entry 41) and rung36_jcon_scan2 (entry 42) of corpus/tests/icon/rung36_all.icn HANG:
# a genuine infinite regeneration, not a load or timeout artifact. Row
# icon-rung-scan-alternation-infinite-regeneration-hang (seat04 2026-09-04, re-measured hq_B 2026-09-05:
# still live, 13.3M and 13.5M lines of output before SIGTERM at 20s).
#
# ⛔ TERMINATION IS NOT THE CRITERION -- a cure that stops the loop and prints the wrong stream is not a
# cure, it is a quieter defect. Each entry is graded BY VALUE against its own segment of rung36_all.ref,
# which is oracle-cut: entry 42's ref is byte-identical to iconx on this box (verified 2026-09-05). Entry
# 41 cannot be graded against icont directly at all -- icont REJECTS it ("`;`: invalid declaration", our
# own semicolon conversion after a record declaration), which is why the suite ref, not the oracle, is the
# comparison here and why that ref must never be re-cut from SCRIP's own output.
#
# ⛔ REFUSES rc=2 unless all 4 runs (2 entries x 2 modes) are graded, and rc=2 if either segment extracts
# empty -- an extraction that silently yields nothing would grade an empty program against an empty ref
# and print the success shape over the gap.
