#
# THE DEFECT (row snobol4-mode-4-crashes-on-a-deferred-any-after-a-break-or-span-was-built): mode 4 died of SIGSEGV in
# rt_pat_prim_str_take on a match with a deferred ANY (or NOTANY) argument once the program had built a BREAK or SPAN pattern
# anywhere before it -- X = BREAK('a') then ('abc' ? ANY(*Z)) faulted where mode 3 and sbl -bf answer 'b'.
# THE CAUSE (measured in the m4 emission): the deferred ANY/NOTANY box handed the take its out-pointers at LFDQ/LFD slots it
# does not own -- ANY and NOTANY are not leaf-frame members (zdp_scratch_cell lists SPAN, BREAK, BREAKX, TAB, RTAB, REM) and
# their drive case assigns neither x86_scratch_off nor op_leaf_frame_off, so the address was [rbp + 16] with no BREAK before
# it (a write above the frame base that worked by luck) and [rsp + 520192] after one (a stale offset). Giving them BREAKX's
# 16-byte transient instead was tried and withdrawn: a deferred call that raises (an undefined function) then crashes, exactly
# as a deferred BREAKX does today on the same input (its own row).
# THE CURE: the deferred ANY/NOTANY box holds no stack memory at all. After the prim glue evaluates the argument into
# g_prim_val (a collector root), bb_glue_prim_member computes the subject character (or -1 at the end) and one runtime call,
# rt_pat_prim_member(ch, codes), coerces the value with the box's code pair (raising 43/49 as before) and answers 1 member,
# 0 not, 2 end of subject, -1 raised or failed: ANY succeeds on 1, NOTANY on 0. No raw pointer or length is ever on the stack.
#
# One program, every answer cut from sbl -bf at run time and pinned: a pinned line sbl no longer prints is a REFUSAL, never a
# green.  Both modes.  rc=0 clean · rc=1 a divergence · rc=2 REFUSAL.
