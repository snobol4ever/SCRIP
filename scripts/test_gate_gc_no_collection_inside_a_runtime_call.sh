# test_gate_gc_no_collection_inside_a_runtime_call.sh -- THE ALLOCATOR NEVER COLLECTS AND NEITHER DOES A RUNTIME CALL:
# a safe point is taken by EMITTED code at the return of an allocating runtime call, never by C inside the call
# (Lon 2026-09-17, in-chat to the ceo; RULES.md FACT RULE THE COLLECTOR GUESSES NOTHING, CEO-812: "a landing that adds
# ... a collection inside a runtime call is reverted on sight").
#
# MEASURED 2026-09-23 (cto, row gc-a-site-that-refuses-every-poll-form-names-an-unrooted-holder-...): a bare poll after
# the concat call_rt at bb_binop_concat_slot.cpp:84 DIFFed procedure_every_alt_replace_16 at SCRIP_GC_STRESS=1 under
# SCRIP_GC_RELOC=1 in both modes.  The gdb trace (trace2.py: seams, allocations, collections and the variable's block in
# order) read: c_rt_assign_var_body opened with a SHIELDED rt_gc_point_arr(sh, 2, 0) from the original 1ac176625
# regeneration; the tvsubs road (a[2:3] := "XYZ") built the new string with rt_str_alloc, then called rt_assign_var
# RECURSIVELY, whose entry seam collected with the two shielded cells repaired -- and the OUTER body's C local `vc`
# (the VCELL block) was stale across it, so `vc->len = srclen` wrote 0x0000000000000003 into the relocated result string.
# Under ordinary compaction the block usually keeps its address (84.7% of forwardings, CEO-1109), which is why a shielded
# seam inside a runtime call reads green for months: it protects the two cells it was handed and nothing else the C
# frames hold.  The seam is deleted; the emitted poll after rt_assign_var_strict (bb_assign_var.cpp:47) is the safe point.
#
# THIS GATE RATCHETS THE CLASS TO ZERO.  Every caller of a collector entry (rt_gc_point, rt_gc_point_arr, rt_gc_point_arr_c,
# rt_gc_point_arr_probe_c, rt_gc_poll_slow, rt_gc_collect_now) OUTSIDE the collector's own files is counted from source.
# The standing set is DECLARED BY NAME below: 19 functions (20 sites) on 2026-09-23 -- 18 in by_name_dispatch.c (the dop
# entries and the Prolog rt_pl_dop_*_c leaves, the ceo's row gc-the-five-c-to-bb-entries-...-and-the-three-riders-in-by-
# name-dispatch-c) and rt_scan_enter in gen_runtime.c.  Each is resolved to its ENCLOSING FUNCTION by the python pass
# below, so a site that moves within a function does not move the list.  A caller not on the list is a regression and
# reds; a declared caller that is gone reds too, so the list moves in the landing that earns it.  FAIL_ONCE=1 plants one.
