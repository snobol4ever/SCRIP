# test_gate_preflight_arms_stay_cheap.sh -- the guard on `make preflight` (hq_T's ask 2026-09-06; hq_R wired it).
# ⛔ WHAT IT PREVENTS, in hq_T's own words: "the target will quietly acquire a 45-second arm and stop being the
# thing that made it worth running." The value of a preflight target is that nobody weighs whether to run it, and
# that value is destroyed by a single slow arm -- silently, because a slow arm is still a CORRECT arm.
# ⛔ MEMBERSHIP IS PINNED BY MEASURED DURATION, NEVER BY A PATTERN OVER THE TEXT. A static grep cannot see one
# level of indirection: test_gate_pl_quad_regs.sh (~45s) and test_gate_capture_stdin_and_red_exit.sh (~15s) reach
# the compiler through lib_ helpers without naming it, and a comment-stripped grep clears both.
# ⛔⭐ A LOADED BOX IS NOT A SLOW ARM (the cfo's measurement 2026-09-24 09:2x; ceo CEO-1234; row instruments-the-cheap-preflight-
# gate-reds-on-its-40-s-total-at-load-above-25-with-no-single-arm-slow-so-a-loaded-box-reads-a-false-red): at load 26-32 the 59
# arms took 50.5 s of WALL time against the 40 s total with no arm over 5 s, so this BLOCKING arm redded for every seat on the
# box's load, not on a slow arm -- the class CEO-1197(2) named for the death gate. Each arm is now timed for WALL and CPU (user +
# sys, which load does not inflate): CPU over its budget is RED at any load; WALL over its budget is RED only at or under the
# declared load ceiling (PREFLIGHT_LOAD_CEILING, default the core count; the load is the highest 1-minute average read before,
# during and after the run), and above it a WALL-only excess REFUSES rc=2 naming the load -- could not measure, never green,
# never red. ⛔ AND ONE INVOCATION PER ARM, THE ONE `make preflight` RUNS: a .py arm was timed on `bash -c`, which exec'd a
# non-executable script and failed in milliseconds (or ran an executable one), then run AGAIN by python3 untimed -- so no .py
# arm's duration was ever measured, and util_gate_wiring.py ran twice.
# SELF-PROOF (before the real list, on fixture arms under mktemp): a 1.2 s sleep against a 1 s budget reds at a ceiling no load
# reaches and refuses at a ceiling of 0; a 1.5 s CPU loop reds at a ceiling of 0 (CPU); so the gate can still red on load-proof
# evidence and can no longer red on load alone.
