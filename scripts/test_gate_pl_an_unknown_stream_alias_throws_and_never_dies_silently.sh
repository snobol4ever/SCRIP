# test_gate_pl_an_unknown_stream_alias_throws_and_never_dies_silently.sh -- EVERY STREAM BUILTIN HANDED AN UNKNOWN
# STREAM-OR-ALIAS THROWS A CATCHABLE existence_error(stream, A) AS THE ORACLE DOES, AND NOTHING FAILS OR EXITS
# SILENTLY; AND A REGISTERED ALIAS RESOLVES for write/2, nl/1, format/3, close/1 and set_output/1 (row
# prolog-a-user-stream-alias-is-never-registered-and-write-to-one-dies-instead-of-throwing, hq_R 2026-09-13).
#
# WHAT THIS PINS AND WHY IT IS THE WORSE HALF OF ITS ROW. ISO/IEC 13211-1 § 7.12.2 j) and § 8.11 make an unknown
# stream-or-alias an existence_error(stream, A). SCRIP threw it correctly from eighteen stream builtins and, from
# eight others, did something strictly worse than a missing feature: get_char/2, peek_char/2, get_code/2,
# peek_code/2, get_byte/2, peek_byte/2, close/1 and stream_property/2 FAILED -- observationally identical to a
# plain `fail`, rc=1, no ball, no message, invisible to catch/3. A missing error that FAILS stops a program; a
# failure indistinguishable from a legitimate one lets the caller's own if-then-else take the wrong branch and
# carry on. That is CEO-556's class, and it is why the row ordered the dying guard cured FIRST and alone.
#
# ⛔⭐ THE CAUSE WAS IN THE ASM THUNK, NOT IN THE C. Each C leaf already called pl_stream_idx_ball and produced a
# perfectly correct ball. rtx_plunify.s has two thunk macros over one calling convention: PL_CTX_LEAF_BALL zeroes
# CTX_BALL, reads it back and turns it into a throw; PL_CTX_LEAF neither initialises that slot nor reads it. The
# eight were registered under the plain macro, so a correct ball went into an uninitialised stack slot and was
# never looked at again. Each side reads as finished on its own -- which is exactly why the CLASS is held by
# test_gate_pl_ctx_leaf_thunks_cannot_drop_a_ball.sh (cto, same day) and the BEHAVIOUR is held here. Neither
# gate subsumes the other: that one proves no leaf can drop a ball, this one proves the balls are the ones ISO
# asks for and that a live alias still works. Run both.
#
# ⛔ EVERY WITNESS IS GRADED THROUGH catch/3 AND OFF MARKERS THE PROGRAM ITSELF WRITES, NEVER OFF STDERR OR rc.
# The defect being pinned IS a wrong rc with an empty stream, so an rc-graded or stderr-graded witness reads
# GREEN over it. A caught ball must leave rc=0: a throw that kills the process is not a throw.
#
# ⛔ THE NO-THROW POPULATION IS THE CONTROL AND IT IS THE POINT. Over-throwing is the natural failure mode of this
# cure -- a resolver that rejects every stream passes a throw-only gate perfectly. The R rows below use a LIVE
# alias and a live handle through the same builtins and must NOT raise; they caught a real one in development,
# where routing close/1 through the direction-checking resolver made close(user_input) a permission_error.
#
# ⛔ CULPRIT/CONTEXT DETAIL IS DELIBERATELY NOT GRADED. swipl says context(system:write/2,_) where SCRIP says _G0;
# ISO leaves the second argument of error/2 implementation-defined. The gradeable invariant is the CLASS
# existence_error(stream, A) with A the offending name, and its CATCHABILITY. Both are oracle-anchored on swipl.
#
# ⛔ unget_char/2, unget_code/2 and unget_byte/2 ARE GRADED BUT NOT ORACLE-ANCHORED, AND THE DIFFERENCE IS NAMED:
# swipl has no such predicates at all (it answers existence_error(procedure, unget_char/2)), so there is no oracle
# verdict to diff. They are SCRIP extensions sharing one resolver with the six ISO siblings, so their CLASS is
# anchored by those six rather than by swipl. Writing "matches the oracle" for them would be a false provenance.
#
# ⛔ IT RESOLVES ITS SUBJECT FROM ITS OWN TREE, NOT FROM S4E_HOME (coo 2026-09-13): a gate that resolves through
# S4E_HOME grades the MAIN tree no matter which tree invoked it, so a green run in a side tree is a statement
# about a tree you did not change.
# Usage: bash scripts/test_gate_pl_an_unknown_stream_alias_throws_and_never_dies_silently.sh [--verbose]
# EXIT 0 all witnesses graded and correct in BOTH modes; 1 at least one wrong (named); 2 REFUSED (cannot measure).
