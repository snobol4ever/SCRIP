#
# ⛔ THE DEFECT (ceo 2026-09-14, x64 math_pow). rt_real_overflow existed and ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV and BINOP_POW
# all called it. BINOP_POW_PROMOTE -- the same operator reached through the promoting path -- returned
# `REALVAL(pow(ld, rd))` with no finite check at all, so `1.2532722125503777 ** 2.6531489453414562e+10` handed
# back `inf` while its sibling one line above raised 266. math_pow: CRASH -> 3600 pass / 0 fail.
#
# ⭐ THIS IS THE NO-PER-OP-FILTER LAW MADE EXECUTABLE. "All members of a BB family are the same; a defect
# reachable through one member is a class defect." The family here is arithmetic overflow, and the member that
# was missing is the one nobody writes a witness for -- the promoting spelling of an operator whose ordinary
# spelling is correct. A gate holding only the operators someone remembered is how the gap survived.
#
# ⛔ SNOBOL4 HAS NO INFINITY: an operation that overflows must raise, never yield a value. Sits beside
# test_gate_sno_a_real_that_overflows_is_not_a_value.sh, which holds the CONVERSION half of the same rule.
#
# rc=0 clean · rc=1 a family member yields an infinity · rc=2 REFUSAL (cannot measure).
