# test_gate_baton_donewhen_runnable_live.sh -- the DONE-WHEN of row live-batons-all-carry-a-computable-donewhen (ladder I, rank 1).
#
# ⭐ WHY A SECOND GATE AND NOT A FLAG ON THE FIRST (ceo ruling 2026-09-02, on hq_P's measurement). test_gate_baton_donewhen_runnable.sh answers "can this DONE-WHEN reach a verdict?" over EVERY
# baton on disk, and other rows already grade against that number. This gate asks the narrower question the ruling scopes: "can every LIVE row's DONE-WHEN reach a verdict?" ⛔ It COMPOSES the first
# gate rather than reimplementing its parser -- one authority for "is this DONE-WHEN runnable", never a second copy that can drift from it. Modifying the first gate's output to add a filter would
# have moved a number other rows are pinned to; that is why this is a wrapper.
#
# ⛔⭐ LIVENESS IS THE WHOLE POINT, AND IT IS WHAT MAKES 74 THE WRONG NUMBER TO CHASE. Of the 74 uncloseable batons measured 2026-09-02, only 49 sit on rows that can still be worked. The other 25
# are two DIFFERENT problems wearing the same symptom, and the ruling gives each its own rider: 11 sit on rows already marked DONE -- so those closures were never graded, and they are AUDIT material,
# not a backlog -- and 14 are ORPHAN BATONS with no QUEUE.tsv row at all, which is a claim nobody can make. ⛔ Curing all 74 uniformly would "fix" 25 rows by writing criteria nobody will ever run.
#
# THE GATE: LIVE uncloseable == 0. The other two populations are PRINTED, never graded here -- they are the riders' material, and a gate that failed on them would block this row on work the ruling
# deliberately routed elsewhere. ⛔ REFUSES rc=2 rather than guessing if either input is missing: an instrument that cannot measure must not pass what it failed to read.
