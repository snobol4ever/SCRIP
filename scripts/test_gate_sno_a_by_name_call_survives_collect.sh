# test_gate_sno_a_by_name_call_survives_collect.sh -- A FUNCTION NAME IS NOT A HEAP OBJECT: a by-name call still
# resolves its function after COLLECT has run twice (hq_V, HQV-52/53, ceo rank-0
# snobol4-a-by-name-call-loses-its-function-name-across-collect-so-the-next-builtin-resolves-the-empty-string).
#
# MECHANISM, measured 2026-09-13 and not inferred: the lowerer interns every function-name string through
# lp_strdup (src/lower/lower_common.c), which allocated with rt_pinned_strdup and so put the name IN THE COLLECTED
# HEAP as HB_WSS. bb_call.cpp:453 emits the call site two ways -- mode 4 writes the name into .rodata and takes a
# rip-relative lea (a fresh copy OUTSIDE the heap, which is why every mode-4 arm was byte-exact), mode 3 bakes the
# RAW POINTER as an immediate. ⭐ AN IMMEDIATE IN AN INSTRUCTION STREAM IS NOT A SLOT IN MEMORY, so no root scan
# reaches it, so the block is never marked, so COLLECT reclaims it and the next by-name call resolves the empty
# string: SCRIP_DEBUG_APPLY=1 printed unresolved '' (ufname='', nargs=1) and core.c's _func_buckets lookup missed,
# raising error 22 Undefined function called. ⛔ PINNING WAS NEVER THE PROTECTION -- HB_WSS IS pinned, and PINNED
# MEANS DOES NOT MOVE, NOT IS NOT RECLAIMED. Direct observation: the heap top moves BACKWARDS across the second
# COLLECT, ...fc0 -> ...f60, with the name pointer left below it. CURE (SCRIP e593ee934): lp_strdup allocates with
# malloc, evicting the program-lifetime string class from the collected heap.
#
# ⛔ WHY THIS GATE EXISTS AT ALL: the cure was proven on csnobol4_suite/intval, a PACKAGE entry, and a cure proven
# on a program that can leave the denominator owes a gate that keeps it under test. The witness below is minted
# here, graded against the oracle, and cannot be cut from under the cure by a suite edit.
#
# ARMS: (1) mode 3, the 5-statement witness, 20 runs, every one byte-identical to the oracle -- THE DISCRIMINATOR;
# (2) mode 4, the same witness, byte-identical to the same oracle ref -- mode 4 was never exposed and this arm
# keeps it that way rather than assuming it; (3) csnobol4_suite/intval in mode 3 against its shipped ref, the
# package entry the row was opened on.
# ⛔ THE SECOND COLLECT IS LOAD-BEARING: a witness with ONE COLLECT passes on the defective build. Measured.
# FAIL-ONCE / PASS-ONCE, 2026-09-13, by reverting lp_strdup to rt_pinned_strdup and REBUILDING (the two libraries
# verified distinct by sha256 -- an A/B that does not prove that compared a build with itself, which is how two of
# my own control arms were voided this week): arm 1 FAILS 20/20 on the reverted build, PASSES 20/20 on the cure.
