# graded for CORRECTNESS against an iconx cut taken AT RUN TIME, then TIMED against Arizona iconx and
# JCON jcont on the two-number basis.  Lon 2026-09-10, verbatim via ceo CEO-493: "Get the classic Icon
# benchmark set working. Duh!!!"  Basis ruled by ceo CEO-494; written hq_P 2026-09-10.
#
# ⛔⭐⭐ WHY THIS IS NOT A callgrind Ir BOARD, AND THE RULING IS NOT A PREFERENCE (ceo CEO-494).
# Every other benchmark in this tree measures Ir, because Ir is DETERMINISTIC: bench_two_number_ir.sh's
# own header cites three consecutive runs returning byte-identical counts, and that property is what
# buys the economy of a single rep.  ⛔ IT DOES NOT HOLD FOR A JVM.  Measured here 2026-09-10 on the
# int_loop kernel under jcon: 1,069,787,424 Ir then 1,443,104,013 Ir -- a 35% spread on the same program
# and the same box, because JIT compilation decisions vary run to run.  So Ir REFUSES for the jcont arm,
# and jcont is measured on the two remaining angles (fixed iterations, and the process wrapper) by WALL
# and CPU, warm-up discarded, MEDIAN of at least five runs, the spread PRINTED beside every median.
# ⛔ NO MULTIPLE EVER CROSSES INSTRUMENTS: a wall multiple is computed against a wall number and a cpu
# multiple against a cpu number, and every column says which instrument produced it.
#
# ⛔⭐⭐ THE 790x TRAP, RECORDED HERE BECAUSE THIS IS THE FILE THAT MEASURES A JVM (hq_P 2026-09-10).
# If you ever DO put jcont under callgrind: callgrind does NOT follow exec into a child process unless
# --trace-children=yes.  A jcon program is a /bin/sh wrapper that execs java, so an untraced reading of
# an empty Icon program is 367,008 Ir where the truth is 291,132,178.  ⭐ The number it returns is not
# malformed, missing or suspicious -- it is a small, plausible, correctly measured count OF THE WRONG
# PROCESS, and on a board whose whole question is "who does less work" it reads as the rival winning by
# three orders of magnitude.  Every guard on that board -- the client exit-status check, the CEO-173
# overhead refusal -- passes it.
#
# THE TWO-NUMBER BASIS: OVERHEAD is the empty-program constant per engine, measured by this same
# protocol; WORK = median_total - median_overhead.  ⛔ CEO-173: when OVERHEAD is >= 50% of an arm's
# reading, the WORK multiple is REFUSED for that program and the labelled TOTAL-basis multiple is
# printed in its place -- never both, never a work number with a quiet asterisk.
#
# CORRECTNESS GATES THE NUMBER: the oracle output is cut at run time by iconx, and an engine whose
# output differs byte-for-byte gets NO multiple.  A wrong answer is never a fast answer.
#
# EXIT: 0 = board printed, 1 = a program was RED (wrong answer or did not run), 2 = REFUSED (nothing
# measurable -- an empty or plausible table is the failure this guards against, so it never prints one).
