# (Lon 2026-09-18, in-chat, relayed by the cto: "every FINDING file lives in .github/findings/, NEVER in the .github root"; ceo CEO-859/862/866,
# RULES.md line 31). RENAMED FROM test_gate_no_finding_files.sh, WHICH ENFORCED THE OPPOSITE. That gate implemented CEO-760/796's prohibition;
# Lon retired the prohibition on 2026-09-18 and the gate went RED IN make preflight FOR EVERY SEAT the moment the first permitted FINDING landed
# (the cto's, .github e3b47af1) -- a fleet-wide landing block created by a law change, which is the cost of a gate that encodes a rule's POLARITY
# rather than its INVARIANT. It is repurposed rather than deleted for the same reason the digest gate's arm was flipped rather than dropped: the
# location rule needs policing too, and a deleted gate polices nothing. What it cannot check is the clause that matters most -- that a FINDING's
# measured claims are FOLDED into the citing baton or GOAL cursor in the same landing -- which is why that stays law and gets its own row.
# Cheap, no build: `git ls-files` in .github and SCRIP; population printed; rc=1 names each offender; rc=2 when a repo cannot be listed.
# FAIL_ONCE=1 plants a FINDING at the .github ROOT in a scratch clone and grades that clone, so the criterion is proven to red.
