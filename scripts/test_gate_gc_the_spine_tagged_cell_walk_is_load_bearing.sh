# test_gate_gc_the_spine_tagged_cell_walk_is_load_bearing.sh -- THE LICENCE FOR THE SPINE-CELL VERDICT IN THE
# SAFE-POINT CONTRACT CHECKER (cto 2026-09-22, MODE DUO/QUARTET; row gc-the-planner-gives-every-call-result-live-
# across-a-safe-point-a-slot-the-map-covers; ARCH-GC section 2b RULE 1a and section 3b, CEO-996/1108).
#
# WHAT IS HELD HERE, IN ONE SENTENCE.  util_gc_safe_point_contract.py stopped calling 222 findings over 111 sites
# K3 MEMBERS and started calling them SPINE-CELL, on the ground that a call result stored as rax at a 16-byte
# aligned k and rdx at k+8 below the region base is a TAGGED DESCR CELL, which ARCH-GC section 2b RULE 1a covers
# through gc_cell_visit inside gc_walk_words and which no frame map was ever meant to cover.  RECLASSIFYING A
# POPULATION IS EXACTLY HOW AN INSTRUMENT GOES QUIET WHILE LOOKING BUSY, so the reclassification is not allowed
# to rest on a reading of the design page.  This gate switches the mechanism OFF and requires the tree to notice.
#
# THE EXPERIMENT.  SCRIP_GC_NO_SPINE_CELL=1 makes gc_walk_words skip gc_cell_visit for the spine class ALONE --
# the mapped interior, the header words and the above-root range are untouched, so the only thing removed is the
# mechanism under test.  MEASURED over the declared 52-witness contract floor at SCRIP_HEAP_MB=1,
# SCRIP_GC_STRESS=3, SCRIP_GC_RELOC=1: 16 witnesses change their answer, 15 of them from the 23 that carry a
# BELOW-REGION store.  hb_datblk dumps core, hb_nv trips the ZGC-STALE trap on a stale pointer, and
# hb_mkexpr_unmapped_spine_store -- the witness ARCH-GC section 3b is named after -- goes match to nomatch.
#
# ⛔ WHAT A GREEN HERE DOES NOT SAY.  It does not say the spine walk is as strong as a map: the walk FINDS a cell
# by stepping 8 bytes and trying, so a false cell earlier in the range can put it out of phase, and a tag word
# overwritten before the collection drops the cell to a raw word.  The grid half of that is held next door by
# test_gate_gc_the_spine_cell_grid_is_anchored_at_the_region_base.sh.  Making the coverage STATIC instead of
# discovered is still the planner's open row.  This gate says only: the mechanism the SPINE-CELL verdict names is
# LOAD-BEARING TODAY, so the verdict is a naming of a real covering road and not an amnesty.
#
# ⛔ AND IT IS WRITTEN TO EXPIRE.  Arm (c) NAMES every declared witness that no longer changes its answer.  When a
# planner cure moves these results into mapped slots the set empties, arm (b) goes red on purpose, and the answer
# is to RETIRE the SPINE-CELL verdict and re-cut the floor -- never to widen the population until the arm passes.
#
# ⛔ TWO OPERATIONAL FACTS THAT COST THE FLEET SOMETHING TODAY, BOTH MEASURED, BOTH BUILT IN HERE.
# (1) THE MEMORY BOUND, AND THE LEVER IS A CGROUP RATHER THAN A ulimit BECAUSE THE cfo MEASURED THE ulimit AND IT
#     IS A FORMALITY.  The B leg of this experiment on hb_dvec_sort_match read 26,857,344 KB peak RSS against
#     19,712 KB for the A leg, AND EXITED ZERO -- a lost root does not only print a plausible wrong answer, it can
#     commit the whole machine first, and no rc, no timeout and no arena cap sees it, because the arena cap bounds
#     the collected heap and not what the mutator asks malloc for (the cfo caught this one as a 1 GB-available box
#     at 10:51 and could not name its owner; it was mine).  RLIMIT_RSS is a no-op on this kernel, so the obvious
#     lever is ulimit -v -- and ulimit -v bounds RESERVED ADDRESS SPACE, which is not the quantity that hurt
#     anyone.  ⛔ THE cfo's READING, ON THEIR TREE AND AGAINST MY FIRST CUT: hb_defer_subject at the DEFAULT arena
#     aborts at 4 GB AND at 6 GB with the heap reserve mmap failing, runs at 8, and its actual peak RSS is 12,780
#     KB -- so the smallest ulimit that does not produce a false abort is 640x the memory the run uses, and at
#     that setting the 27 GB leg would still have been free to take 8.  A ceiling with 640x headroom is not a
#     bound.  ⭐ THEIR LEVER, RE-MEASURED HERE BEFORE IT WAS ADOPTED: systemd-run --user --scope with
#     MemoryMax=2G and MemorySwapMax=0 bounds RESIDENT pages, so the reserve passes straight through.  On this
#     tree the B leg on hb_dvec_sort_match is SIGKILLed, rc=137, and the A leg is rc=0 with correct stdout.
#     MemorySwapMax is load-bearing: with MemoryMax alone a 3 GB allocation SUCCEEDS by swapping and degrades
#     every seat without tripping anything.  ulimit -v is kept ONLY as the fallback where systemd-run is absent,
#     at 8 GB, which is the floor both trees agree on -- and the fallback SAYS SO in the population line rather
#     than pretending the two bounds are the same thing.  ⛔ MY OWN FIRST CUT AT 4 GB CRASHED hb_coexpr_sigma.icn
#     IN THE CONTROL ARM (a co-expression is a pthread with its own mmap'd stack), which is a gate-made crash that
#     reads exactly like a defect, and it is the second reason the cgroup is the right home for this.
# (2) setarch -R, ON THE coo's RULING OF THE SAME MORNING.  A cell graded once is a sample: 20 identical runs of
#     one Icon cell read CRASH 18 PASS 2 under ASLR and SEGV 20 of 20 under setarch -R, while a genuinely green
#     cell read rc=0 20 of 20 under both.  The flaky outcome is the PASS, so the variance runs in the direction
#     that closes rows.  Pinned in the GATE and never on an acceptance board, where the flake is a real shipped
#     silent-wrong-answer rate and pinning it would configure away a severity rather than measure it.

# THE DECLARED NAME SET (the coo's rule: a gate whose population is a directory glob cannot carry a blocking
# verdict when five seats write the directory).  Every member was measured to change its answer under the knob on
# 2026-09-22.  hb_dvec_sort_match and hb_dvec_data_convert are DELIBERATELY OUT despite qualifying: they are the
# two that reach tens of gigabytes in the B leg, and a landing gate is a shared resource.
# ⭐ AND ONE EXCLUSION RESTORED BY THE CURE THAT EARNED IT, KEPT HERE AS THE RECORD RATHER THAN DELETED.
# hb_coexpr_sigma.icn was excluded on 2026-09-22 because it could not pass arm (a): at SCRIP_HEAP_MB=1 with
# SCRIP_GC_STRESS=3 it answered its ref exactly at 14 lines, and adding SCRIP_GC_RELOC=1 alone took it to
# 7 LINES AT rc=0 -- half a co-expression's output lost with a zero exit, and a witness whose CONTROL leg is
# red proves nothing about a B leg.  That was the ceo's r13 row and the exclusion said in its own text that
# it went back the moment the row landed.  IT LANDED: SCRIP e42cc0909 turned the bare polls at bb_deref.cpp:39
# and bb_scan_upto.cpp:52 into x86_rt_gc_poll_rec_sigma with keep_rax zero, where the subject base was live in
# r13 across the poll.  RE-MEASURED BY THIS SEAT AT faddd1a00, 80 draws, four cells of 20: relocation OFF and
# ON, crossed with plain ASLR and setarch -R, 20 of 20 PASS AT 14 LINES IN EVERY CELL.  Arm (a) passes and the
# spine knob still changes its answer, so it qualifies for arm (b) as well and is a member again -- which is a
# reading of the ceo's board taken from the enforcement side and independent of it.
# ⛔ AND ONE HELD OUT, NAMED HERE WITH ITS ROW, REPORTED ON EVERY RUN AND NEVER SILENTLY DROPPED (cto 2026-09-22, evening).
# hb_nested_match_outer_subject.sno prints NO for OK-3-y2y under SCRIP_GC_RELOC=1 at stress 1, 3, 4, 6 and 8 and answers
# right at 0, 2, 5, 10 and 16 and at every stress WITHOUT relocation, at MB=1 and at the shipped 128 KB alike.  Bisected
# twice with a build per step: on main the first bad commit is the cfo's 58820a280 (the concat-slot bare poll REMOVED),
# and with that poll patched out at every step it is fa1dc84a5 (the asm poll's r13 probe) -- yet REVERTING fa1dc84a5 on
# HEAD leaves this witness red at 4 of 5 stress points and breaks hb_scan_subject_across_allocating_poll.icn at all 5.
# So neither commit is the cause; each only moved WHICH poll collects.  The walker's own telemetry reads s_raw_heap=1
# divergence=1 on main's C-stack walk: ONE RAW HEAP WORD the typed walk cannot see -- the outer match's subject across
# the deferred *GC() call, the unrooted deferred-call class hq_snobol4 owns (the standing chop's blocked bb_match_defer
# site).  A control leg red for a defect another lane owns proves nothing about the B leg, so the witness is HELD OUT:
# its control leg still runs and prints REPORTED below, and it returns to POP in the landing that roots that subject.
