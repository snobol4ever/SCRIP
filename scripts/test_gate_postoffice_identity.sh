# test_gate_postoffice_identity.sh -- NEGATIVE-INJECTION GATE for fleet-v2 preflight V2-3 + V2-4 (hq_P, s258).
# ⛔ LAW 0 (ARCH-FLEET-CEO.md): no instrument backs a DONE-WHEN until negative-injection proves it can say NO.
# Every check below was RUN AGAINST THE PRE-PATCH SCRIPT FIRST and observed to FAIL -- that is what makes a
# later green meaningful. The whole gate runs inside a THROWAWAY postoffice ($S4E_POST) so it can never touch
# /home/resources/postoffice; identity is forced with $S4E_SEAT so no test depends on which root it runs in.

# ⛔ THE BINARY UNDER TEST MUST BE OVERRIDABLE, AND THIS GATE SHIPPED WITHOUT THAT (caught by hq_C's
# cross-verification, s258, in the intended direction). The path was hardcoded to $(dirname $0)/s4e_msg.sh,
# so when hq_C tried to aim the gate at the PRE-PATCH script to confirm my "15 of 18 fail" claim, the
# injection SILENTLY DID NOTHING and the gate reported a confident 18/18 over the wrong binary. ⭐ That is
# the exact class this gate exists to hunt -- an instrument that cannot say NO because it is not looking at
# the thing you think it is (LAW 0, species 3) -- shipped inside the instrument itself. A gate whose subject
# cannot be redirected can only ever confirm the tree it sits in.

# -- which is exactly the environment `done` runs a DONE-WHEN in, and this gate is a component of
# test_gate_dispatch_bus_failure_modes, now an arm of `make test` for all sixteen seats. A seat whose shell
# exports its own identity would have gotten a red make test for a reason having nothing to do with its work.
