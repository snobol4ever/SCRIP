# GATE: no live baton DONE-WHEN may (A) capture a runner's output without being able to tell that runner's
# REFUSAL from its RED, or (B) pin a SEAT ROOT in the text the bus actually runs -- as an ${S4E_HOME:-...}
# fallback OR BARE (`cd /home/claude_ceo/SCRIP && ...`), which grades whichever tree that seat happens to
# hold instead of origin HEAD. Class B's bare half is coo 2026-09-23 (CEO-1163, RULES.md THE INSTRUMENT
# LAWS thirty-fourth batch clause 3: a criterion that names a seat root names a tree). MEASURED AT THAT
# LANDING: 46 defective, and 28 of them pin a root that HAS NOT EXISTED SINCE CEO-767 -- so they grade no
# tree at all, and `rung-gate-false-green-audit` is a PROVEN FALSE GREEN because its `! grep -qi ... 
# /home/claude10/.github/FINDING-...md` inverts grep's rc=2-on-a-missing-file into rc=0 DONE.
# Both classes come from the ceo's own audit: FINDING-2026-09-11-ceo-a-done-when-that-captures-a-board-turns-
# could-not-measure-into-failed.md. Under ONE RUNNER, ONE BOARD a runner answers any seat but the coo with
# rc=2; a criterion that greps the captured TEXT and never looks at the rc turns that refusal into rc=1
# FAILED -- so precisely the rows that most need auditing cannot be audited by hand by anyone but the coo.
# ⛔ THE CENSUS IS NOT IN THIS FILE. It is util_donewhen_rc_census.py, the one authority, so that the gate and
# the cure can never drift apart -- the four-copies-of-one-extractor defect lib_donewhen.sh was written to end.
# --self-test PROVES THE GATE RED rather than asserting it, and proves the CLASS behaviourally: it stands up a
# stub runner that exits 2 the way a real runner refuses, runs a criterion of the bad shape and of the cured
# shape against it, and shows the bad one answering rc=1 FAILED where the cured one answers rc=2 REFUSE.
