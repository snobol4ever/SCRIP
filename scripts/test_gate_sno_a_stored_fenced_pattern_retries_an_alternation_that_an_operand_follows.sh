# test_gate_sno_a_stored_fenced_pattern_retries_an_alternation_that_an_operand_follows.sh -- A FENCE-BEARING PATTERN HELD IN A VARIABLE OR BUILT AT RUN TIME, WHOSE ALTERNATION IS FOLLOWED BY ONE MORE OPERAND,
# IS STILL RE-ENTERED WHEN A LATER ELEMENT FAILS: the retry reaches the alternation's next arm, and a walk that exhausts it and reaches
# a bare FENCE aborts the whole match, as SPITBOL does (hq_snobol4 2026-09-27, row snobol4-a-stored-fenced-pattern-with-an-operand-
# after-its-alternation-never-backtracks-into-it-tpgm4-two-part-gotos; SPITBOL test program 4's GOTO_FIELD, whose tail is OPT(BLANKS)).
#
# MECHANISM: src/lower/lower_snobol4.c, sno_pat_publish_body_root. A PAT$ or RT$ graph gets its resume root from the carrier build's
# out_brt; 11c73f1e5 made a fenced sequence publish its rightmost segment's resume tail, but the fenced branch admitted a tail only at
# seam tier 1 or 3 (zdp_seam_tier). A trailing operand -- NULL (a deferred variable), '', LEN(0), OPT(BLANKS) -- is tier 2, a beta
# that walks leftward, so the graph was rootless: RPOS(0) could not retry the alternation, and a bare FENCE the walk should reach never
# aborted either -- the pattern failed whole and an outer alternative matched. A tier-2 tail's leftward walk reaches the FENCE only
# after every generator to its right is exhausted, and the FENCE's own beta then aborts: the manual's rule (v3.7 p.126: FENCE fails
# the match when the scanner backs up THROUGH it). The fenced branch now admits tier 2 as well.
#
# WITNESSES (11 lines, the ref CUT FROM THE ORACLE at run time): 1-4 stored, the trailing operand NULL, NULL after FENCE directly,
# LEN(0), ''; 5 run-time built through a user function, test program 4's GOTO_FIELD verbatim in shape; CONTROLS 6 inline, 7 no FENCE,
# 8 a trailing alternation (green before), 9 and 10 the walk reaches the bare FENCE and the WHOLE match aborts though an outer
# alternative would match (NO in SPITBOL), 11 the same with no FENCE (the outer alternative matches, YES).
# FAIL_ONCE (recorded, hq_snobol4 2026-09-27): on f32289815 (the cure absent) m3 AND m4 diverge on 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9 and 10 (9 and 10
# read YES: the pattern failed whole and the outer alternative matched); with the cure all 11 lines equal the oracle in both modes.
# THE CTO'S REVIEW (2026-09-27, accepted 5f445d5fd): 12 is the cto's control -- a conditional-capture tail must read V=c, never V=b
# (a skipped capture's stale record); 13-17 widen it: an immediate-capture tail, a capture around a generator, a cursor-capture
# tail, two stacked capture tails, and an abort through the bare FENCE with a capture tail and an outer alternative (sbl NO).
# Witnesses 9, 10 and 17 also guard the fallback first-node root the widening reaches (the cto's note).
# ARMS: (1) mode 3 and (2) mode 4 run the witness; every line must match the oracle byte for byte.
