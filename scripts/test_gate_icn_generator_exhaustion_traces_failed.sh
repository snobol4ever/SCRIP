# test_gate_icn_generator_exhaustion_traces_failed.sh -- a traced generator that EXHAUSTS prints "NAME failed".
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (CEO-459): under &trace, iconx prints five lines for a generator -- call, suspended,
# resumed, failed, and the caller's own failure. SCRIP printed TWO: the generator's exhaustion emitted no
# trace event at all, because the N-2 generator RETIRE branch had no tap. This gate covers the retire tap.
#
# ⛔ IT ASSERTS PRESENCE, NOT THE WHOLE LINE SET, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE. `suspended` and `resumed` are
# still missing and are owed (they need the yielded value at a zeta-addressed slot, and a CALLER-side tap,
# both frame work held under CEO-447). A gate that pinned "exactly these three lines" would go RED the day
# those two land -- it would freeze the incomplete state into a criterion and make finishing the feature
# look like a regression. So each arm asserts that a specific correct line IS produced, with its exact
# line number, bar depth and text cut from iconx, and says nothing about lines not yet emitted.
#
# ⛔ &trace WRITES ONLY TO stderr, and lib_ladder.sh runs with 2>/dev/null -- which is why the ladder rung
# for this family is red only through an exit code and would go green on a crash fix alone (hq_B). This
# gate captures stderr explicitly for exactly that reason.
