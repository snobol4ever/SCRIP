# test_gate_gc_carve_advances_the_virgin_mark_past_a_straddling_block.sh -- A BLOCK CARVED BELOW THE VIRGIN MARK THAT ENDS
# ABOVE IT DIRTIES GROUND THE ARENA STILL CALLS UNTOUCHED (cfo 2026-09-16, THE COLLECTOR, the rehash row taken back from
# hq_snobol4 under CEO-802).
#
# MECHANISM, measured with gdb on the row's own witness and not inferred: rt_gcheap_carve (gc_heap.c) skips the payload
# memset when `at >= g_hp_virgin` -- the virgin-zero elision of 963c0390b (HP-2), correct only while EVERY byte above the
# mark is still the kernel's zero page. The advance was guarded by the same test: `if (at >= g_hp_virgin && at + total >
# g_hp_virgin) g_hp_virgin = at + total`. After a compaction lowers g_hp_top below the mark, a 20 KB DUPL string carved
# just under the mark ENDS ABOVE IT, the caller writes its bytes over that ground, and the mark does not move. The next
# compaction lowers the top again, a fresh HB_AGGB bucket is carved on the dirty ground as "virgin", its memset is skipped,
# and _tbl_grow hands _tbl_rehash a cap-1 bucket whose len reads 0x78787878 ("xxxx"): _tbl_lower(n=2021161080) walks off
# the block. gdb at the fault: the bucket's title is VALID (size 80, type 211, HBF_TTL) and its words are 'x' bytes --
# the block is not moved, not reclaimed, not unrooted; it was never zeroed. hq_snobol4's two rehash cures (an own heap
# type for the old vector; re-reading every slot through the table) could not move it because the rehash is where the
# garbage is READ, not where it is MADE. The rtx carve (rtx_alloc.s) carves only at/above the mark and sets it to the
# new top, so it never straddles; only the C carve did.
# CURE: one line -- the mark advances whenever a block's END passes it, whatever its start: `if (at + total >
# g_hp_virgin) g_hp_virgin = at + total`.
#
# ARMS: (1) STRUCTURAL: the carve's advance line carries no `at >= g_hp_virgin` guard; (2..5) the row's witness cut to
# 3000 statements -- a TABLE, an ARRAY and a DATA record live across 3000 statements of 20 KB string churn (the origin
# SIGSEGV lands at the 256->512 rehash near statement 1025, so 3000 keeps the red and drops the 30000-statement form's
# quadratic 46 s mode-3 run under stress, measured on the cure at load 7-9) -- in mode 3 and mode 4 at SCRIP_GC_STRESS=20
# and =200, each rc=0 and byte-identical to `sbl -bf`. Stress 20 is THE discriminator (deterministic SIGSEGV on origin,
# 3 of 3 both modes); stress 200 is green on origin by layout luck and is kept as the second shape. Cost on the cure 9 s
# at load 10 (7 s red on origin) -- test-sequential beside the collector gates, not preflight (5 s ceiling).
# FAIL-ONCE / PASS-ONCE 2026-09-16 on one tree, `git stash` around the one-line diff, runtime rebuilt each side (1.4 s),
# libraries distinct by the freshness probe's so-hash (origin b2ae6d702148, cure f8eb24499e14): origin 163ae51c8: structural
# FAIL, m3 stress=20 rc=139, m4 stress=20 rc=139, stress=200 both PASS -> rc=1. cure: five arms PASS -> rc=0. The 30000-
# statement form is the row's own DONE-WHEN and passed on the cure in both modes (m3 46 s, m4 29 s at load 7-9).
