# test_gate_icn_a_large_integer_crosses_into_a_loaded_c_function.sh -- A LARGE INTEGER PASSED TO A loadfunc'd C FUNCTION ARRIVES AS
# ICONX'S OWN LARGE-INTEGER BLOCK, AND ONE RETURNED COMES BACK AS AN ICON INTEGER, IN BOTH MODES (hq_icon 2026-09-27, crawl work under
# CEO-1270/CEO-1336: Arizona general/cfuncs, whose lgconv(10^30) died "error 101: integer expected" with the library in reach).
#
# The C calling convention of the Arizona distribution (ipl/cfuncs/icall.h) hands a function iconx descriptors: an integer too large
# for a word is D_Lrgint, its v-word a struct b_bignum {title, blksize, msd, lsd, int sign, 32-bit digits most significant first}.
# SCRIP's marshaller had no arm for its own DT_BIG, so the argument crossed as &null and ArgInteger raised 101. The cure builds the
# iconx block from SCRIP's limbs going in (rt_big_icnx_block), rebuilds a SCRIP integer from one coming out (rt_big_from_icnx_block),
# and lets cnv_str and cnv_real read it, as iconx's conversions do. The witness calls the distribution's own libcfunc.so (lgconv, which
# walks the block's digits; pack with "rb", which reads it through ArgReal; unpack of one, which reads it through ArgString and fails
# 205 with its decimal string) through loadfunc on an absolute path, so no FPATH and no linked io.icn is involved;
# expectations come from a live iconx run. On the tree before the cure the lgconv lines differ (red).
