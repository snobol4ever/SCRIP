# test_gate_cross_suite_ref_agreement.sh -- TWO SUITES MUST NOT HOLD CONTRADICTORY REFS FOR A BYTE-IDENTICAL
# PROGRAM. When they do, at least one ref is wrong, and nothing in the tree says which -- so a board built on
# the wrong one reports a red that is CORRECT OUTPUT FAILING A BAD REF.
#
# ⛔ WHY THIS EXISTS, and it is a measured cost, not a hypothetical (hq_B 2026-09-03, row ICN4, ceo CEO-177):
# `procedure_every_scan_replace_5` in ALL.ref said Icon's x[-3+:6] FAILS; `rung36_jcon_lists` in
# rung36_all.ref said it yields `[4] 3 4 5 6`. THE SOURCES WERE BYTE-IDENTICAL. icont agrees with the second.
# ALL.ref was wrong, so the master board's two reds were correct SCRIP output failing a bad ref -- and I
# "cured" the compiler to match the bad ref, landing a real regression and a FALSE GREEN at 380/381 that five
# green arms and a ceo audit all missed, because not one of them asked the ORACLE.
# ⭐ A ref is evidence about a PAST ORACLE RUN, not about the oracle. This gate cannot tell which ref is right
# -- only an oracle run can -- but it can prove that a disagreement EXISTS, which is the cheap half and the
# half that was available to me for free the whole time. It converts "somebody eventually notices" into a red.
#
# METHOD: corpus/tests/<lang>/ALL.csv carries a durable `origin` of the form <family>__<entry>. Where that
# family exists as a sibling suite (<family>.icn + <family>.ref), the same program is present twice. For every
# such pair: if the SOURCES are byte-identical and the REFS differ, that is a contradiction -- reported by name,
# with the first differing line of each, so the reader can take it to the oracle immediately.
# ⛔ Sources that DIFFER are silently fine: an entry legitimately edited on conversion is a different program,
# and flagging it would make this gate noise. Only byte-identical sources are evidence about refs.
# EXIT 0 no contradictions; 1 at least one (names them); 2 REFUSED (cannot measure -- never skip-as-success).
