# Row prolog-multifile-initialization-only-first-file-root-graph-wired (minted seat09 2026-09-06, cured hq_C same day).
#
# THE DEFECT THIS PINS: the driver records ONE lowering segment per positional source file and calls lower_pl_stage2
# once per segment. Each call builds its own root graph and registers its own "main" proc, and pl_new_proc's
# `main_mod < 0` guard makes the FIRST one win. So `scrip a.pl b.pl` ran a.pl's directives and SILENTLY dropped
# b.pl's -- exit 0, no output, no error. The swi_tests runner always passes the real entry point (its wrapper)
# LAST, so this alone held that whole suite at 0/114 in both modes.
# THE CURE: adjacent Prolog segments are coalesced into one segment before lowering, so multi-file lowers exactly
# like the concatenated file -- which is the arm (d) control below.
#
# WHAT IT PROVES, in four directions so a silent compiler cannot pass it:
#   (a) BOTH files' goals run when BOTH carry a directive -- this is the cure, and it is what first-wins broke.
#   (b) ORDER IS FILE ORDER, asserted by running the SAME two files BOTH WAYS and demanding the outputs swap.
#       Without this arm a "make the LAST file win" cure -- which the oracle disproves -- would pass.
#   (c) A directive-less FIRST file does not swallow the second file's goal (seat09's original minimal repro).
#   (d) The CONCATENATED single file agrees with the two-file form: multi-file must not be its own dialect.
#   (e) The oracle is ASSERTED, never assumed: swipl is run on every arm and REFUSES if its answer moved.
# ⛔ Hermetic: every program is written under mktemp; nothing in corpus/ is read or written.
