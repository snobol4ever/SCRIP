# test_gate_sno_want_name_request_is_consumed_not_left_standing.sh -- A BY-NAME REQUEST IS CONSUMED BY THE
# RETURN IT WAS RAISED FOR, AND DOES NOT STAND AFTERWARDS.
#
# WHAT THIS IS: the end state of row want-name-must-live-in-the-activation-not-in-a-global-that-stays-live-
# across-the-callee-body (hq_V's FINDING-2026-09-08, cured by hq_U 2026-09-13). `.F()` raises the caller's
# "I want a NAME" request through SNO$WANTNM; the callee's activation parks it (AB_OFF_WN) and the return
# fix decides deref-or-not from the parked value. The request is PER CALL. Before the cure rt_nret_fix
# ENDED by writing the request back into the global instead of clearing it, so one `.F()` anywhere left
# rt_g_want_name standing at 1 for the rest of the program and EVERY later plain `F()` wrongly kept its
# name. bb_define.cpp's own NRETURN comment already said the epilogue "reads+clears it" -- the C did not.
#
# ⭐ THE WITNESS IS TWO STATEMENTS AND THE SECOND IS THE ONE THAT WAS WRONG. A gate that grades only the
# by-name call passes on the broken tree: the defect is invisible until a SECOND, ordinary call follows.
# So every arm here runs at least one plain call AFTER a by-name one, and all three arms are graded
# against `sbl -bf` -- the ref is cut from the oracle, never from our output.
#
# ARMS: sticky (the two-statement minimum, plus three later plain calls that must all stay STRING)
#       nested (an outer request pending while an inner one is raised and taken inside the callee body)
#       deep   (three NRETURN levels, dotted then plain, so a mis-cleared inner request shows as a deref)
#
# EXIT: 0 all arms match the oracle in both modes. 1 an arm regressed. 2 UNPROVEN (no scrip, RT or oracle).
