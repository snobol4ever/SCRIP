# THE DEFECT (the cto 2026-10-02, row snobol4-eval-of-a-match-on-fence-of-x-or-y-where-y-keeps-state-jumps-to-address-0, minted
# from Lon's infinite_snobol4 random set: 189 of its 202 remaining SIG11): EVAL("'z' ? FENCE('a') | ARB") jumped to address 0,
# both modes; sbl answers the null string. A FENCE whose body held nothing complex was not a fence_frame_candidate, so its
# watermark (the alpha-saved rsp, the capture-stack top, the cursor) went to its zls frame slot addressed [rsp + off] as if rsp
# stood at the frame base -- but inside a match rsp stands under the match frame and the subject. In the EVAL chain the slot
# (0xb0) landed on the match frame's saved r12 and rbp (rbp - rsp = 0xb8 at the FENCE), so the match's exit restored a
# capture-stack pointer into rbp and the chain's ret went to 0. The static compile wrote the same way, onto the dead subject
# copy above the frame, and survived by luck.
# THE CURE (emit.cpp fence_frame_candidate): every non-bare FENCE inside a match region is a frame candidate, so its state
# lives in the match frame (rbp-relative, frame_slot_off) and the match frame is carved for it (emit_match_begin_frame_extra
# and frame_slot_scan read the same predicate).
#
# Each arm grades one line of the evaluator against sbl -bf cut AT RUN TIME, both modes; the last program loops 300 times
# through both forms. rc=0 clean · rc=1 a divergence · rc=2 REFUSAL.
