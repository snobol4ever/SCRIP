#
# SPITBOL'S RULE FOR AN ERROR WHILE EVAL(string) RUNS (sbl.min's stage stgee, the rule CEO-1322 copied; measured
# here with sbl -bf at run time): EVAL compiles the string and evaluates it under stage stgee, and err04 pops the
# error to the nearer of the innermost program-defined function call and the evaluation. At &ERRLIMIT 0 the EVAL
# FAILS and &ERRLIMIT is untouched; at &ERRLIMIT > 0 it is the ordinary err07 path, so the EVAL fails AND THE ERROR
# IS COUNTED (&ERRLIMIT 5 -> 4). Inside a function the evaluation calls, the erring statement fails and the
# function goes on. Any evalx exit inside the evaluation (an inner *LEN(1) matched) resets the stage, so a later
# error in the same evaluation is an ordinary one: fatal at &ERRLIMIT 0, counted above it. A SETEXIT armed at
# &ERRLIMIT 0 is not entered: the EVAL fails as if none were armed.
#
# WHAT SCRIP DID BEFORE (cfo 2026-10-02, the c2bb eval-chain row's design question): eval_chain_run_guarded ran the
# chain under g_error = -1, a longjmp guard that failed the EVAL on any error and never counted it, so every
# &ERRLIMIT > 0 arm below read ERRLIMIT=5 where sbl reads 4. The guard also kept the stage's resets from reaching an
# error after an inner evalx (reset0 read CLEAN where sbl is FATAL). And with a SETEXIT label armed at &ERRLIMIT 0
# (setexit0) the -1 guard does not longjmp, the handler arm needs &ERRLIMIT nonzero, and the error fell through to
# the fatal exit, killing a run sbl finishes. On the parent tree 18 of these 26 arms read red. The cure runs the
# chain under the stage (G_ERROR_EVAL_STAGE), the mode core_runtime_error already reads as "count it, the operation
# fails". The setjmp stays: it is how a level unwind (core_unwind_next, code 3) crosses this C frame.
# NOT COVERED, AND WHY: an inner EVAL of an unevaluated expression, EVAL(*(X + 0)) inside the string, is not an evalx
# in SCRIP (the stage never resets there), so sbl's FATAL is SCRIP's failed EVAL under both guards; the error's
# fatal LINE is not graded, because sbl numbers an error in execute-time-compiled code past END and the voice of
# that line is the error voice's business, not this rule's.
#
# Expectations are cut from sbl -bf AT RUN TIME. Each arm grades, per mode, FATAL versus CLEAN and the stdout before
# the error. rc=0 clean · rc=1 a divergence · rc=2 REFUSAL.
