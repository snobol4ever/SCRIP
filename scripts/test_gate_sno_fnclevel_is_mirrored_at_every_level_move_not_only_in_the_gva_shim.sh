# ⭐ CURE GATE for row snobol4-fnclevel-not-incremented-entering-a-defined-function (cfo 2026-09-13, released to
# cfo by hq_P the same hour: under NONET hq_P is CONCERN 2 SPEED and SNOBOL4 completeness is CONCERN 1, cfo's).
# THE DEFECT: &FNCLEVEL read 0 at every depth inside a program-defined function -- a constant, not an off-by-one --
# and every trace banner raised inside a call lost its depth marks with it, because the banner's depth IS kw_fnclevel
# (core.c trace_print_banner_args).
# ⛔⭐ WHY A ROW THAT READ DONE WAS STILL LIVE, AND IT IS THE GENERAL SHAPE: the sibling row conform-fnclevel-not-
# tracked landed the enter/leave pair in bb_define's ROLE-4 TINY SHIM (bb_fnclevel_enter/bb_fnclevel_leave), and that
# shim is only CHOSEN when the program builds a GVA island. Every program that does not take that arm kept the
# original defect, and nothing measured it, because the witness that would have shown it lands on the other side of
# an emit-time branch. A CURE CONDITIONAL ON AN EMIT-TIME ARM IS LIVE FOR EVERY PROGRAM THAT DOES NOT TAKE THAT ARM.
# ⭐ THE CAUSE, READ OUT OF THE EMITTED ASSEMBLY RATHER THAN REASONED: a demoted .s carries two kw_fnclevel
# references and BOTH ARE READS; the GVA .s carries five, three of them WRITES. In the runtime, rt_k_level was MOVED
# at thirteen sites in rt.c and MIRRORED into kw_fnclevel at only two of them (rt_ab_enter_env/rt_ab_leave_env) --
# hq_P counted the thirteen independently. THE CURE IS THE INVARIANT, not a site: kw_fnclevel == rt_k_level - 1
# wherever rt_k_level moves, expressed once as rt_k_level_mirror() and called at every move.
# ⛔ THE CONTROL ARM IS THE POINT OF THIS GATE AND IT USES NO TRACE AT ALL. SCRIP_M3_GVA=0 turns the island off for
# a program that would otherwise build one, so arm 'gva_off_control' exercises the slim path on a source with no
# TRACE in it -- which is what proves the defect was never about ACCESS, and what would go red again if a future
# cure moved back into the GVA-conditional arm. Its m4 twin is arm 'banner_depth': an ACCESS trace demotes the
# island at compile time, so that witness reaches the same slim path in BOTH modes without an env knob.
# ⛔⭐ WHICH ARMS ACTUALLY DISCRIMINATE, MEASURED ON THE PRE-CURE BINARY RATHER THAN CLAIMED FOR ALL FOUR: only
# 'banner_depth' (RED in BOTH modes), 'gva_off_control' and the source invariant went red before the cure.
# 'manual_repro', 'nested' and 'ctl_no_call' were ALREADY GREEN there -- they take the GVA shim, which the sibling
# row cured -- and they are kept as the arms that go red if a future cure fixes the slim path by breaking that one.
# A gate whose green arms are counted as evidence of the cure is the same disease this row was minted for.
# ⛔ NOT ASSERTED HERE: Icon's &level. It reads rt_k_level DIRECTLY (keywords.c "level"), not kw_fnclevel, and this
# cure moves no rt_k_level value -- the Icon ladder was measured 688/688 before and after and is the arm for that.
