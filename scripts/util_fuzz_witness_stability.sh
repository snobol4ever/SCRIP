# util_fuzz_witness_stability.sh — measure whether the row fuzz-nondeterminism-rootcause's 5 witnesses (see util_fuzz_witness_materialize.sh — they are master-suite entries now, not files) are STABLE AGAINST THEMSELVES,
# in BOTH modes, comparing (stdout, rc) AS A PAIR.  Refuses (rc=2) if it cannot measure.
#
# ⛔⭐ WHY THIS EXISTS — A WITNESS SET WHOSE OWN STABILITY IS UNMEASURED CANNOT FALSIFY ANYTHING.
# Row `fuzz-nondeterminism-rootcause` spent SIX sessions grading candidate cures against these
# witnesses without ever measuring the witnesses.  Two independent measurements the same afternoon
# disagreed, and BOTH were correct:
#   * hq_C ran 10x, sampled STDOUT FIRST LINE, in MODE 3 only  -> "fz_red_m4a is stable 30/30"
#   * hq_B ran  5x, sampled EXIT CODE,        default arm       -> "fz_red_m4a cycles rc 0/132/139"
# A witness can be perfectly stable in its output and cycling in its rc.  Each of us called our own
# instrument "the witness".  So this runner fixes all three axes that were left implicit:
#   (1) N repeats, refuse on ANY disagreement -- never "looks the same, ship it";
#   (2) BOTH modes -- an m3-only sample cannot see an m4 crash-signal effect;
#   (3) (stdout, rc) AS A PAIR -- either alone reproduces the exact ambiguity this exists to remove.
# ⭐ The catch that produced this script was not vigilance: hq_B got lucky that an accidental second
# sample existed minutes later.  Vigilance does not transfer; repeat-and-refuse does.  That is the
# whole argument for putting it in the tool (RULES.md § A SIGNAL REACHABLE BY TWO CAUSES THAT NAMES
# ONLY ONE, applied to an instrument rather than a defect).
#
# EXIT: 0 = every witness stable in both modes · 1 = at least one witness UNSTABLE (that is a real
# result, not an error) · 2 = REFUSE, could not measure (missing binary/RT/dir, or zero witnesses).
# ⛔ An unstable witness is NOT a failure of this script.  Instability is the measurement.  Use rc=1
# as "do not grade a cure against this set until the named witnesses are stabilised or excluded".
