# util_pl_zd_arm_census.sh — THE PROLOG ζ-ADMISSION CENSUS (PZ-0(c), GOAL-PROLOG-100).
#
# Answers the conversion's denominator question: of every ZD run in every Prolog graph, how many
# are ARMED (ride the ζ spine) and how many are REFUSED — and for the refused, WHICH IR KIND
# refused them.  A ZD run is all-or-nothing (s163: the unlock set is five kinds, all-or-nothing
# per run), so the refusing kind is the load-bearing fact: it names the next admission arm to
# write, and the per-kind rollup is the conversion ladder's progress meter.
#
#   bash scripts/util_pl_zd_arm_census.sh [--arm default|cells|both] [--jobs N] [file.pl ...]
#
# Default corpus: corpus/prolog/*.pl + corpus/benchmarks/prolog/bench/*.pl.
# Read the table as CANDIDATES, not verdicts: a kind at the top of the refusal table is where the
# next PZ rung goes.  ⛔ FALSIFY BY INJECTION before believing a zero (run one program you know
# refuses and confirm it appears).  Compile-only sweep — programs are never executed.
