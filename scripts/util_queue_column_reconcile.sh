# util_queue_column_reconcile.sh — reconcile QUEUE.tsv's STATE column (col4) against claims/<topic>.claim,
# which is the authority. Audit by default; --fix repairs the one direction that is safe to repair.
#
# ⭐ WHY THIS EXISTS (hq_B 2026-08-29, on hq_P's queue-wide audit; row queue-column-unwritten-by-acquiring-verbs).
# s4e_msg.sh's acquiring verbs (claim / next / assign) wrote the claim file and NOT the state column, while the
# releasing verbs (park / done / unclaim) wrote the column — so the column learned about endings and never about
# beginnings. Measured before the cure: of 16 rows holding a live claim, 15 read FREE. The script fix stops NEW
# drift; this reconciles the rows that drifted before it landed.
#
# ⛔⭐ THE TWO DIRECTIONS ARE NOT THE SAME SEVERITY, AND CONFLATING THEM IS THE MISTAKE THIS SCRIPT EXISTS TO STOP.
#   A: live claim, column reads FREE      -> ILLEGIBLE, correctly dispatched. The picker skips any row with a claim
#      file regardless of the column, so nothing is double-served. Cosmetic-but-load-bearing: a human reading the
#      queue sees free work that is not free. SAFE TO REPAIR — mirroring the claim changes no dispatch outcome.
#   B: column names an owner, NO claim file -> UNSERVABLE BY A SEAT. PASS 3 serves only FREE|'' so the column
#      hides it, and PASSES 1/2 iterate claim FILES so nothing resumes it. ⛔ NOT auto-repaired: returning it to
#      FREE is a DISPATCH act on someone else's row, and the column may be the only surviving record of intent.
#
# ⛔⭐ AND B IS NOT ONE POPULATION — hq_P's correction, 2026-08-29, reported against their own row. The first
# version of this script called every B row unservable, which reads as a defect. For one of the two populations
# it is the FEATURE:
#   B-RESERVED: an HQ-ONLY row (e.g. defect-c-zop-flat-regime-depth-compensate, CEO-19). The picker does NOT
#      filter on the owner column and only the STATE column is load-bearing (s265), so a row left FREE would be
#      served to whichever seat called `next` — and that seat's own baton tells it not to attempt the work.
#      ASSIGNED-with-no-claim IS THE DOCUMENTED MECHANISM for reserving a row to an HQ. Nothing is wrong.
#   B-STRANDED: a seat's lock vanished and the row is genuinely marooned. This one is the defect.
# ⭐ THE DISCRIMINATOR (hq_P's, and it needs no human): a RESERVATION never had a claim, so it has no release
# receipt under released/; a STRANDED row generally does. It is a heuristic, not a proof — so this script LABELS
# and never acts, and says which population it thinks each row is in and on what evidence.
