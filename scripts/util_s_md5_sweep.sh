# util_s_md5_sweep.sh — per-program mode-4 .s md5 sweep, for killswitch byte-identity and blast-radius gates.

# LISTFILE = one .sno path per line; default list = corpus demo (maxdepth 1) + crosscheck + probe/bb.
# Compare arms/builds with:  diff A.md5 B.md5   (or join to list movers).  Landed s145 (HQ) — the gate that
# proved ARBNO-TAIL-BETA byte-identity (529/529) and the SEED-NAMES fix .s-invariance ran exactly this shape.
#
# ⛔ rc IS RECORDED AND A FAILED COMPILE IS NEVER HASHED (s149, per s148's instrument brief).  The old test was
# `[ -s p.s ]` alone: a compiler that DIED partway still leaves a non-empty TRUNCATED .s, which was then hashed
# as if it were a legitimate result — the s33 "non-empty is not alive" false-signal class living inside the very
# instrument every codegen rung is validated against.  Two truncated arms hash to two different md5s and
# masquerade as blast radius.  Now: rc!=0 emits COMPILE_RC_<rc>, which is a STABLE label — a program whose
# compile segfaults reads COMPILE_RC_139 in BOTH arms and correctly shows as ZERO movers instead of two random
# hashes.  rc==0 with empty output emits COMPILE_EMPTY.  Only rows carrying a real md5 are byte-identity claims.
# Measured at s149 on 529 programs: rc==0 527, rc!=0 2 (crosscheck/coverage/coverage_sno_nodes.sno,
# programs/snobol4/demo/expression.sno), and ZERO failed compiles emitted bytes — so the hazard has no live
# instance on this tree today and this change is byte-identical in effect here.  It is landed anyway because the
# next codegen rung that segfaults the compiler is exactly when a silent wrong answer would cost a session.

# The summary exists so a byte-identity claim states its own DENOMINATOR (s149): "0 movers" is only as strong as
