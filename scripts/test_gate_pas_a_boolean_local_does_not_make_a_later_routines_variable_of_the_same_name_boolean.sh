# test_gate_pas_a_boolean_local_does_not_make_a_later_routines_variable_of_the_same_name_boolean.sh -- a Boolean declared in one routine is a Boolean only inside that routine (ISO 7185 6.2.2.1, the scope of an identifier is its block).
#
# MEASURED 2026-10-09 by hq_pascal against fpc -Miso: `procedure one; var r, f: boolean; ...` followed by `procedure two; var r: real; f: integer; begin r := 6.5; f := 3; writeln(r:8:3); writeln(f:1) end` printed r as 0.000 and f as t in
# both modes where fpc prints 6.500 and 3. The parser kept every Boolean variable name it had ever seen in one table that was never emptied (pas_boolvar_add, no release), so a later real, integer or character of the
# same name was classified Boolean: writeln of it took the true/false path, and an assignment of a real to it was lowered as a Boolean store. Found while running Pascal-P5's interpreter under the byte-addressed variant overlay:
# its callsp declares `f: integer; r: real` after routines with `r, f: boolean`, and every real it wrote came out 0.000. CURE (pascal.y only; no new global, no new table): each Boolean entry carries the routine nesting depth
# it was declared at (the member beside the name; pas_boolvar_add stamps g_pas_npvmark), pas_ptrvar_release -- the existing routine-exit release that already empties the pointer and record variables -- drops the entries
# deeper than the depth it returns to; a Boolean FUNCTION's name is stamped with the enclosing depth (pas_boolvar_add_outer) so a caller after the body still sees a Boolean call; a forward header saves the Boolean parameters it
# declared with its pointer and record ones (pas_boolvar_collect, the bn/bnames members of the forward table) and the full definition that omits the parameter list re-adds them.
# NOT COVERED, written down: the sibling tables keyed by name alone -- the character, set, single and subrange variable tables are still never released (a character local `c` and a later integer `c` share a class).
#
# ARMS, both modes: one control cut LIVE from fpc -Miso: Boolean locals r and f in one routine and a real r and an integer f in the next (written, computed and printed), a Boolean function used in conditions after its body, a
# forward-declared routine with a Boolean parameter and an integer parameter of the same name in a routine declared between the header and the body, a nested Boolean function whose local shares a name with an integer local
# of its parent; it must be byte-identical. FAIL_ONCE=1 corrupts the control's ref.
