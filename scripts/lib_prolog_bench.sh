# lib_prolog_bench.sh -- the ONE implementation of two checks every Prolog loop-benchmark angle needs (hq_P 2026-09-02,
# row prolog-instruments-and-baseline-standup). Sourced by test_bench_prolog_timed.sh (angle 1) and bench_prolog_fixed_iter.sh
# (angle 2); a harness that cannot source it REFUSES rc=2 rather than re-implementing either check -- a rule with two copies
# proves the copies agree, never that either is right (same law as lib_perf_fmt.sh / lib_oracle_flags.sh).
#
# ⛔⛔ THE LOOP MUST BE PROVEN TO HAVE LOOPED BEFORE ITS TIME IS DIVIDED BY N. MEASURED on SCRIP f4532dea, -O0, the pin tree of the
# van Roy baseline: the between/3+fail wrapper vanroy/fib.pl (N=64) prints 64 answers on gprolog and on swipl and TWO on SCRIP m3
# and m4 -- then exits 0. Both angle harnesses gated only on bench_rusage's exit= field, so they divided N=65536 by the CPU time of
# two iterations and printed m3 at 3,102,442 iter/s against gprolog's 485 (fib), a 6,400x multiple for a program that had stopped
# after its second iteration. Angle 1 and angle 2 then AGREED on it to within 1% -- the two angles share the defect, so the
# cross-proof certified the fabrication (the "engines agreed at reps=0" witness of RULES.md THE INSTRUMENT LAWS §2, again).
# The cure is not a SCRIP-specific guard (NO PER-ENGINE FILTER): every engine's loop stdout is compared byte-for-byte against N
# copies of the kernel's .expected, and a run whose output is not exactly N answers is reported as what it IS --
# LOOP-OUTPUT-MISMATCH(lines=<seen>/<wanted>) -- and never as a rate. The observation prints first, the belief nowhere.

# measurement). vanroy/ was 21 files, each bench/<k>.pl with `main :- l__(N).` frozen in; the N values were lifted verbatim into
# corpus/benchmarks/prolog/fixed-iter-n.tsv when it was retired, so this generates the same 21 programs at the same 21 counts from
