# test_gate_pl_bom_is_written_detected_and_reported.sh -- open/4's bom(Bool) option must WRITE the UTF-8 BOM
# on a write stream and DETECT it on a read stream, and stream_property/2 must report bom/1 for text streams
# and have NO SOLUTION for it on binary ones (row prolog-logtalk-eleven-unicode-stream-cases-routed-from-the-
# builtins-family-row, hq_R 2026-09-13).
#
# WHAT WAS WRONG. bom(Bool) parsed, validated, and was then used on ONE path only: a read stream skipped a
# BOM if it found one. Nothing wrote a BOM, nothing recorded whether one had been seen, and bom/1 was not a
# stream property at all -- so `stream_property(S, bom(B))` simply failed for every stream in every state.
# ⭐ THE FAILING SHAPE IS WHY IT LASTED: a property that HAS NO SOLUTION and a property that is CORRECTLY
# ABSENT print the same thing, so the six Logtalk cases asserting bom(false) and the four asserting
# `\+ stream_property(S, bom(_))` were half right for free, and the half that was right was the half a
# reader checks first.
#
# ⛔ THE DEFAULTS RUN IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS AND ARM 1 IS WHERE THAT IS PINNED. A read stream skips a BOM it
# was not told about; a write stream must emit one ONLY when asked. The option was held in a plain int
# defaulted to 1, which was right for reading and would have meant "write a BOM" the moment the write path
# looked at it -- and an unrequested BOM corrupts every file this engine produces, which no Prolog-level
# test would ever show. It is tristate now, and ARM 1 reads the actual first bytes rather than asking the
# engine what it thinks it did.
#
# ⛔ ARM 6 IS THE ONE THAT STOPS THE CHEAP CURE. Reporting bom(false) unconditionally passes every positive
# arm above it and reds the four binary cases that assert the property is ABSENT -- and a cure that trades
# one case for another never lands (CEO-589).
#
# ⛔ THE BOM IS NOT CONTENT (ARM 5). A detected BOM must be consumed, not delivered: if it reaches the
# program as a character, every read of a BOM'd file is off by one and the file's first term is corrupt.
# rc 0 green · 1 red · 2 could not measure.
