#
# ⛔⭐ THE ACCEPT ARM IS THE DANGEROUS ONE, NOT THE REJECT ARM. A hook that fails to reject lets
# one bad trailer through; a hook that wrongly rejects stops EVERY seat's every commit at once
# (the row's own brief: "a hook that rejects clean messages stops all 20 clones"). So the
# accept cases here outnumber the reject cases on purpose, and they include the exact shape this
# policy's own documentation takes -- prose naming the trailers mid-sentence, which MUST stay
# committable or the policy could never be written down.
