# test_snobol4_spitbol_x64_suite.sh -- the runner for corpus/packages/snobol4/spitbol_x64_tests, row
# snobol4-spitbol-x64-tests-self-check-but-nothing-reads-their-verdict (ceo, 2026-09-11).  36 programs
# vendored from https://github.com/spitbol/x64 test/ -- the upstream of our own correctness oracle, i.e.
# the tests the reference implementation checks ITSELF with.  Before this file nothing graded them: no
# runner, no SCORE.md row, no progress rows.  21 of the 36 are floating point, the thinnest part of our
# coverage.
#
# ⭐⭐ TWO INSTRUMENTS, AND WHICH ONE A PROGRAM GETS IS MEASURED, NEVER LISTED.  The row's whole point is
# that these programs SELF-CHECK: math_chks.inc's `chks(expression, expected)` EVALs the expression,
# compares against the expected value and prints its own verdict -- " pass: <expr> Obs[..] Exp[..]" or
# "*FAIL: <expr> Obs[..] Exp[..] (exception)".  So for those the runner reads THE PROGRAM'S OWN VERDICT
# LINES, which is both cheaper than a cut ref and immune to float formatting: a digit of difference in
# how the two engines print 2.6308364999025599e-307 is not a defect, and a byte diff would call it one.
#   SELF-CHECK arm  (the oracle's own run printed >=1 verdict line): SCRIP passes iff it prints ZERO
#                   "*FAIL:" lines AND exactly as many " pass:" lines as the oracle printed on the same
#                   program this run.  The denominator is measured live, never pinned.
#   STREAM arm      (the oracle printed no verdict line at all): gate_oracle_stdout_match, the ONE
#                   authority for an oracle stdout diff (lib_gate.sh) -- byte-exact stdout plus matched
#                   rc for a clean oracle run, error-identity for a run the oracle halted on.
# ⛔ THE ARM IS CHOSEN FROM THE ORACLE'S OUTPUT, NOT FROM THE FILENAME.  A hand list of "the math ones"
# would be wrong the moment the sibling case-conversion row lands (nine more math files join the graded
# set) and wrong in the other direction for math_limits1..4, which are named math_* and print no verdict
# line at all.  Measured 2026-09-12: 8 of the 24 graded take the self-check arm, 16 take the stream arm.
#
# ⛔⭐ WHY A PASS COUNT AND NOT JUST "NO *FAIL: LINES".  A run that prints NOTHING has zero "*FAIL:"
# lines.  The sibling row records that trap biting for real: the math tests were converted one line each,
# their -INCLUDE was left lower case, and the -bf run then printed nothing at all -- an empty run that
# reads green if you only check rc, or only check for failure lines.  Requiring SCRIP's pass count to
# EQUAL the oracle's makes silence a FAIL, which is what it is.
#
# ⛔ A CRASH OR A HANG IS NEVER A PASS, WHATEVER THE STREAM (the verdict ladder; the measured case is in
# test_snobol4_dotnet_suite.sh's header -- "0 bytes equals 0 bytes" graded a timed-out run PASS).  It
# bites here too and harder: seven of these programs are stdin filters (trim, lower, def, arcget, arcput,
# cfreq, map-x64) which print nothing on /dev/null, so an abort that also prints nothing to stdout is
# byte-equal to a correct run.  rc=124 is HANG, rc>=128 is CRASH, and both are checked BEFORE the stream.
#
# THE POPULATION, and the row's own refusal clause: 36 shipped .sbl.  If the glob does not find exactly
# SPITBOL_X64_SHIPPED (default 36) the runner REFUSES rc=2 rather than grading a population that moved
# under it -- a vendored third-party suite that changes size is a fact to look at, not one to average.
#
# UNGRADED, 12 of the 36, and this runner does not decide it -- UNGRADED.tsv beside the package declares
# them (lib_inventory.sh: all three sidecars are declarations, never inferences).  What the runner does
# is MEASURE the same set live every run and say STALE or UNRECORDED aloud when the declaration and the
# oracle disagree, the shape test_snobol4_dotnet_suite.sh uses for OUTSIDE_SPITBOL_BASELINE.tsv.  Their
# cure is one sibling row: snobol4-twelve-spitbol-tests-hold-code-inside-evaluated-string-literals.
#
# ⛔ NOT AN OUTSIDE-BASELINE SET.  The oracle runs all 36 under its OWN default (folding); it refuses 11
# of them only under `-bf`, the arm WE mandate because it matches SCRIP's case sensitivity.  Under
# CEO-542 the outside-baseline test is about the ORACLE, so these are INSIDE the SPITBOL baseline and the
# gap is ours -- work owed, never a ruling.  That is why they are in UNGRADED.tsv and not UNGRADABLE.tsv,
# and why this runner ships no OUTSIDE_SPITBOL_BASELINE.tsv.
#
# MODE 4 HAS A DECLARED, MEASURED BUDGET.  These programs are enormous by generated-code standards --
# math_minus emits a 55 MB .s in 9 s, and math_pow was still writing at 128 MB after 47 s.  The compile
# runs under `ulimit -f` (SPITBOL_X64_M4_ASM_MB, default 64) and a timeout, so a program whose asm does
# not fit is DEFERRED WITH ITS MEASURED SIZE in the record, never silently dropped and never allowed to
# fill the disk.
# ⛔⭐ SKIP IS RETIRED AS A LEAF AND SPLITS BY WHO DECIDED (hq_T ruling 2026-09-12, GOAL-TEST-SUITE-
# CONSISTENCY.md, .github 8fda2878, on this runner's own ask).  One word was carrying two facts that want
# opposite readings, and the instrument HAD the distinction and threw it away:
#   DEFERRED     -- WE chose not to measure, and it carries its threshold (asm over the budget, or the
#                   compile timeout).  Not our failure; not a pass either.
#   COMPILE_FAIL -- OUR OWN toolchain refused a GRADED program.  ⛔ That is not a skip at all, it is a
#   LINK_FAIL       failure, and calling it SKIP is skip-as-success wearing the ladder's clothes.  Both
#                   are counted in m4_fail, not in a bucket beside it.
# So m4_deferred is the only excluded bucket and it names its threshold; a program our compiler could not
# build is red, which is what it is.
#
# Exit: 0 iff FAIL=0 in both modes over the graded population, the same contract as every sibling package
# runner (dotnet, gimpel, snoflake, csnobol4).  rc=2 when it cannot measure.
