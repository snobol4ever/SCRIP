# scripts/bench_min_of_n.sh -- MIN-OF-N benchmark rail for the SNOBOL4 RTX ladder.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. bench_rtx_3arm.sh reports a MEDIAN and refuses on intra-arm spread. s220
# established that on this machine only the MINIMUM is stable, and s224 measured the MEDIAN
# verdict getting WORSE with more rounds (1.071x -> 1.922x on an UNCHANGED binary). A statistic
# that moves on an unchanged binary cannot grade a port, so every speed claim on this ladder has
# been blocked behind this instrument for four sessions running.
#
# THE STATISTIC. Wall time under contention is a MINIMUM plus non-negative noise: an interfering
# process can only ever make a run SLOWER, never faster. The minimum of N is therefore the best
# available estimator of the true cost and is monotone-stable as N grows -- adding rounds can only
# lower it or leave it alone, never flip a verdict the way a median can. We report MIN as THE
# answer and carry med/max/spread only as a health readout on the measurement environment.
#
# HONESTY RULES BAKED IN (they are the whole point):
#   - Every number is labelled with its RT_OPT level. -O0 unless Lon directed otherwise (RULES.md
#     O2-DIRECTED-ONLY). An unlabelled number is not quotable against an optimized oracle.
#   - SPREAD is printed per arm. If spread exceeds SPREAD_WARN% of min, the row is flagged NOISY
#     and the ratio is NOT to be quoted -- it is not refused outright (that hides data), it is
#     marked, because "the window was too short" was FALSIFIED at 5704 ms in s224.
#   - A ratio below RATIO_FLOOR (default 1.10) prints as "~null" per ARCH SNOBOL4-RTX rung 4:
#     NO TWO-ARM NUMBER BELOW ~1.10x IS TRUSTWORTHY on this rail.

# ASLR DEFAULTS TO **off** (s11).  RC-0(a)'s exit criterion is stated "at ASLR=off (setarch -R)", so the
# instrument defaults to the layout its acceptance test is defined on.  The min-of-N statistic does move with
# the layout draw (measured: min 427ms unpinned vs 448ms pinned), so the min is only a stable floor WITHIN one
# layout -- and for an A/B RATIO, a shared fixed layout removes layout as a variable that differs between arms.
#
# ⛔ DO NOT REPEAT THE "PINNING REDUCES SPREAD" CLAIM -- FALSIFIED HERE (s11).  Measured INTERLEAVED (arms
# alternated run-by-run, so thermal/scheduler drift is shared rather than confounded with the arm), fibonacci,
# unchanged binary, N=12: ASLR=on max/min=1.075 (spread 7.5%) vs ASLR=off max/min=1.085 (spread 8.5%).  Pinning
# did NOT reduce spread; it converts layout variance into a fixed unknown BIAS, and this box drew a slow layout
# (~5% slower across the whole distribution).  A first, SEQUENTIAL measurement had suggested the opposite --
# arm-ordered runs on a 1-core box confound drift with the arm.  Interleave, or do not compare.
#
# ⛔ RC-0(a)'s EXIT CRITERION IS NOT MET IN THIS CONTAINER: it requires max/min <= 1.05x at N=12 with ASLR=off;
# this box measures 1.085x pinned and 1.075x unpinned.  ⇒ NO RATIO BELOW ~1.09x IS TRUSTWORTHY HERE, which
# independently corroborates RATIO_FLOOR=1.10 below.  The rail is not yet an accepted instrument on this box.
