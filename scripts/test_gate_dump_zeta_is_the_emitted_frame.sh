# ⭐ RUNG 2 OPENER, SECOND INSTRUMENT, of frame-slot-reuse-a-live-range-in-a-byrd-graph-extends-to-every-point-reachable-by-recession
# (cto, CEO-684 slice 2): THE DUMP MUST BE THE EMITTED FRAME.  --dump-zeta used to run slot assignment in a
# pipeline state the compile and run paths never see: no proc registration, no fl_derive_tier, no zframe mark.
# zls_callee_is_gen() therefore read false for every staged call, the callgen.act quad was not granted in the
# dump while the emitter granted it, and every graph with a staged call to a registered generator callee (every
# Prolog predicate) was printed 16 bytes per such call smaller than the frame the code addresses: r/1 of the
# witness read 448 in the dump and 480 in the emission, its named locals sat at +432..+480 in the code and at
# +400..+448 in the dump, and the field census paired references with the wrong fields.  Every number this row
# had reported (688 / 576 / 448) was the dump's, 32 low.  CURE: the dump path shares the compile path's
# register_procs_all + drive_slots_all (src/driver/scrip.c), emission byte-identical on the Prolog, Icon and
# SNOBOL4 witnesses.  THE CLAIM SPANS TWO SITES (the layout and the emitter), so it is held by this check:
# util_frame_refs_land_in_grants.py grades every literal [rbp+N] of every FN__ body of the Prolog witness against
# the --dump-zeta grant table of the same binary -- a reference below region_end must land in a granted field, a
# reference above it must be in the 64-byte entry header at the top of the carve; the root graph is NOT GRADED
# by name (its carve is not the flat frame).  A finding is a finding, never a lead.
# PINS: (1) every non-root graph graded, none skipped silently; (2) zero findings; (3) r/1 shows the two
# callgen.act quads the old dump never printed (since rung 3(a) the quad is described as 'callgen.act +0' / '+8',
# the two halves the template writes, and sits right after the staged call's result); (4) the MEASURES line.
# RED-BEFORE (the pre-cure binary, same checker): 20 findings on 160 graded graphs, r/1 ungranted=4 -- [rbp+448],
# +456, +464, +472 addressed by the body and granted to nothing, rc=1.
