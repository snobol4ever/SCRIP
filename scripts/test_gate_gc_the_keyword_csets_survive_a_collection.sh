#
# WHAT WAS THERE, AND IT WAS TWO HOLDERS OF ONE ADDRESS. &cset and &ascii are the only two keyword csets whose content
# carries a NUL byte, so they cannot go through make_kw_cset (which reads the registry by NAME and therefore always
# hands back the CURRENT pointer): kw_read built each one itself into a 257/129-byte HB_WSB block and remembered the
# block's ADDRESS in a function-local `static const char *cs`. The registry (g_kw_cset_names[i].ptr) is a visited root
# and moves correctly at every collection; that static is not a root and never moved. After one collection &cset handed
# out a pre-move address: measured as the SIGSEGV of procedure_coexpr_suspend_replace_3 at SCRIP_HEAP_MB=1 (the read
# landed on PROT_NONE ground the repl buffer had since occupied, which is why the vacated ledger named the repl block
# and not the cset -- a ledger entry names the LAST occupant of the ground, not the block the pointer meant).
# The second holder is the POINTER-KEYED index: kw_cset_gc_roots visits the .ptr fields, but g_kw_cset_hidx is keyed on
# their pre-move values and was never rebuilt, so kw_cset_find_ptr MISSED a perfectly current pointer after any
# collection, fell through to the content index -- which refuses a string starting with NUL -- and kw_cset_len returned
# -1, i.e. strlen() == 0 for both csets. `every !&cset` then yielded 0 to 24 of its 256 elements, rc=0, silently.
#
# WHAT IS HERE. kw_read caches the registry SLOT (an int, relocation-proof) instead of the address, and reuses the
# entry kw_cset_prime already registered rather than appending a second one; kw_cset_find_ptr rebuilds the pointer
# index when rt_gc_runs_count() moves, which is outside the collection and costs one pass per collection, not per
# lookup. No allocator changed: the cure for an unrooted holder is a root, never a different allocator.
#
# ARMS. (1) STRUCTURE, both directions: no raw `static const char *cs` cache remains in keywords.c, the two branches
# cache an int slot, and the generation-stamped index refresh exists and is reached from kw_cset_find_ptr. (2) BAND,
# both media: the witness matches its icont-cut ref at stress 0,1,3,5 under SCRIP_GC_RELOC=1 in a 128 KB arena, and
# EVERY arm reports collections>0 from the run's own report -- a tiny arena states a configuration, a collection count
# states an exercise. (3) LENGTH AFTER A MOVE: *&cset, *&ascii and *&lcase read the icont answer once the blocks have
# moved, which is kw_cset_find_ptr's own path rather than the bang's.
