# test_gate_runtime_trampolines_enter_generated_code_16_byte_aligned.sh -- every hand-written trampoline that jumps
# into generated code must leave RSP where the x86-64 ABI says a called function's stack sits, because everything
# below that jump is C: the generated code calls the runtime, the runtime calls glibc, and glibc is entitled to use
# aligned SSE against its own frame.
#
# ⛔ THE DEFECT THIS WAS WRITTEN FOR (ceo 2026-09-14, row snobol4-generated-code-enters-the-c-runtime-with-the-stack-
# misaligned-by-eight). `rt_proc_enter_named` pushes SIX registers (rsi plus the five callee-saved) where its sibling
# `rt_proc_enter` pushes five, and nothing compensated for the parity flip -- so every procedure entered through it
# ran 8 bytes off, and so did every C frame it went on to call. `rt_proc_enter_frag` does the SAME six pushes and
# then `subq $8, %rsp`, with a matching `addq $8` in both exit paths: the compensation existed, was written by
# someone who understood exactly this, and was missing from the one trampoline beside it.
#
# ⭐ WHY IT SURVIVED SO LONG, WHICH IS THE PART WORTH GATING RATHER THAN FIXING: a misaligned stack is not an error.
# It runs. Hundreds of calls return correct answers on it. It faults only when a callee happens to use a 16-byte
# aligned SSE store -- here glibc's vsnprintf, reached through an unrelated DATA() buildplan hook -- so the symptom
# lands arbitrarily far from the cause, in a different language's library, and reads as a SNOBOL4 semantic defect.
# Measured on AI SNOBOL's SIR: 2298 of 2438 runtime calls correctly aligned, 140 not, the flip at one APPLY.
#
# ⛔ THIS IS A SOURCE GATE AND SAYS SO. It does not run a program and cannot see a misalignment introduced by
# emitted code; it holds the five hand-written trampolines, which is where this class lives because they are the
# only places we hand-count pushes. A dynamic arm belongs with the witness, not here.
#
# THE ARITHMETIC, stated so the next reader can check it by hand rather than trusting the parser: a trampoline is
# entered by a CALL, so RSP ≡ 8 (mod 16) at its first instruction. It then pushes N quadwords and subtracts S bytes
# before `jmp *%rax`. Generated code is entered as if CALLED (its own return addresses are the last two pushes), the
# convention rt_outer_call sets, so the requirement is:  8 - 8N - S ≡ 0  (mod 16).
#
# NO BUILD NEEDED (pure source census, <1s). rc=0 clean · rc=1 a trampoline lands on the wrong parity · rc=2 REFUSAL.
