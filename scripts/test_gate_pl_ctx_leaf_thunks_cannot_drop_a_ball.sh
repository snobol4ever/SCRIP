# test_gate_pl_ctx_leaf_thunks_cannot_drop_a_ball.sh -- A PROLOG LEAF WHOSE C HELPER CAN SET A BALL MUST BE
# REGISTERED WITH THE THUNK THAT READS ONE. rtx_plunify.s has two thunk macros over the same C calling
# convention: PL_CTX_LEAF(nm) and PL_CTX_LEAF_BALL(nm, modop). Only the second stores 0 to CTX_BALL before the
# call and loads it back after, turning a non-zero ball into DT_FAIL with r15 set. The first neither
# initialises that slot nor reads it. So a C helper registered under the PLAIN macro can set cx->ball with a
# perfectly correct ISO error and the goal will simply FAIL: the ball goes into an uninitialised stack slot
# and is never looked at again, and the helper's own do-not-overwrite guard is reading garbage on the way in.
#
# ⛔ WHY THIS EXISTS AND WHY A GATE RATHER THAN A RULE (cto 2026-09-13, from hq_C's succ/plus ask):
# hq_C cured rt_pl_succ_plus_cell to raise the four ISO errors succ/2 and plus/3 owe, in both modes, and
# NOTHING CHANGED -- because succ and plus sit under the plain macro. The C side looks complete and correct
# and is neither. That is the defining property of this class: THE CONTRACT LIVES ONLY IN HAND-WRITTEN ASM,
# so it is invisible to every grep of the compiler's own C sources, and each side reads as finished alone.
# RULES.md answers exactly this with a check rather than a memory -- a claim spanning two sites must be held
# by an instrument, because the next helper that learns to throw will go silent for a sitting otherwise.
#
# ⛔⭐ AND IT EXISTS BECAUSE MY OWN FIRST AUDIT OF THIS CLASS WAS WRONG, which is the strongest argument for
# automating it. I resolved each plain leaf by grepping by_name_dispatch.c for the literal `PL_CX_LEAF_HEAD(nm,`
# and reported the class as TWO NAMES. Twenty-odd names came back NO-HEAD and I read that as nothing-to-see
# rather than as could-not-resolve. They were not absent: PL_IN_LEAF, PL_OUT_CX_LEAF, PL_ATOM_OP_LEAF and
# PL_READ_TERM_LEAF each expand TO PL_CX_LEAF_HEAD with the name token-pasted, so the string I grepped for
# never appears in the source. The real count was ELEVEN -- succ, plus, and the nine inbound stream leaves
# (get/peek/unget char/code/byte _s), every one of which calls pl_stream_idx_ball and drops a real
# existent_error or domain_error on the floor. An instrument that reports success while failing to look is
# the recurring defect the INSTRUMENT LAWS exist to catch, and I shipped one before I shipped this.
#
# METHOD, and the preprocessor is the point: regexes over macro DEFINITIONS cannot see token pasting, so this
# gate runs the C PREPROCESSOR over the runtime sources and reads only fully-expanded function bodies. Every
# rt_pl_dop_<nm>_c is then a real definition whatever macro produced it. It extracts brace-balanced bodies,
# builds a call graph, marks the functions that write a ball (cx->ball =, plc_sp_ball, rt_pl_ball_*), and
# propagates reachability. A plain leaf that can reach a ball write is reported WITH ITS SHORTEST PATH, so the
# reader audits the finding instead of taking the verdict's word for it.
#
# ⛔ EVERY PLAIN LEAF MUST RESOLVE TO A BODY THIS GATE ACTUALLY READ. An unresolved name is the failure mode
# that produced the wrong count above, so it is rc=2 REFUSED, never a quiet pass. Same for a preprocessor
# failure: this gate would rather say it cannot measure than report a green it did not earn.
#
# ⛔ IT RESOLVES ITS SUBJECT FROM ITS OWN TREE (ROOT), NOT FROM S4E_HOME (coo 2026-09-13): a gate that resolves
# through S4E_HOME grades the MAIN tree no matter which tree invoked it, so a green run in a side tree is a
# statement about a tree you did not change. This gate reads the sources beside itself.
#
# WAIVERS: scripts/pl_ctx_leaf_ball_waivers.txt, one `<name> <reason>` per line. A waiver is for a REACH that
# is provably not a real path -- the graph is an over-approximation and says so. A waiver with no reason is
# rejected. Curing a leaf means moving it to PL_CTX_LEAF_BALL, never adding it here.
# EXIT 0 every ball-capable leaf reads its ball; 1 at least one drops it (named, with path); 2 REFUSED.
