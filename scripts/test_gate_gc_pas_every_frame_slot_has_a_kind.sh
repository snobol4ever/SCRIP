# EMERGENCY GC RESET, ARCH-GC-COMPILE-TIME-FRAME-MAPS.md section 7 F1: the collector guesses nothing, every frame word carries a
# compile-time kind).  POPULATION: every entry of the Pascal master(s), extracted through the harness's own readers and laid out by
# `scrip --dump-zeta`; util_zls_frame_map_census.py reports every word of the zls region no zls_field covers (region-gap, scope-gap,
# overlap, vslot-unmapped, provisional-kind, unknown-kind).  FAIL-ONCE ON ORIGIN 162e8a172: the return-value cell IR_RETURN writes at
# frame +0 was unregistered in every function graph (raku 318, pascal 514, icon 304, prolog 88364 holes) and two Icon pad quads were
# unregistered (scanseq +8, revswap +56); all registered at this landing, every master reads holes=0.
# THE DETECTOR ARM: SCRIP_TEST_PLANT_ZLS_HOLE=1 (an inert cached-getenv seam in zls_dump, CEO-554's shape) omits the first field of
# every graph; the census on a one-function fixture must then report a hole, or this gate REFUSES rc=2 -- a detector that fails open
# reads as "there was never a bug here".  NOT CENSUSED HERE, said so the reader does not over-read a green: the emitter's wire header
# past region_end (saved continuations and rsp) and the spine cells are the cto's F6 step-2 map cell and DESCR discipline.
