#
# ⛔⭐ THE CLASS (hq_S 2026-09-13, measured; cure site is hq_U's ζ-SPINE depth planner, NOT this seat's files):
# a match WITH REPLACEMENT whose SUBJECT is a SUBSCRIPTED reference (an array element) leaks exactly 64 bytes of
# ζ-SPINE (RSP) every time the statement executes. The statement trailer's whack constant -- op_zgpop, staged from
# g_zd_gpop and stamped by zd_plan (src/ir/zeta_depth.c), emitted on the X86H_JMP gamma hook arm at
# x86_asm.h:1910 -- does not account for the FOUR 16-byte value-stack slots pushed by the store chain that exists
# ONLY for an indexed target: var -> call (rt_call_arr_bl, the SNO$NAME lvalue store) -> var -> assign_var.
# MEASURED, not inferred: RSP falls 0x40 per iteration across five consecutive iterations of the loop form, and in
# the function form the γ/ω continuation pair the RETURN box pops sits at rsp+0x40 while the trailer whacked 96.
#
# ⭐ TWO SYMPTOMS, ONE DEFECT, AND THE ARMS ARE WRITTEN AGAINST THE LEAK RATHER THAN AGAINST EITHER SYMPTOM.
#   (1) inside a function the RETURN box does `pop rcx; add rsp,8; jmp rcx`, reads leaked DATA instead of γ, and
#       jumps to it -- SIGSEGV in BOTH modes (the measured wild target was 0x0000000200008b28, a descriptor half).
#   (2) in a loop the drift is monotonic and eventually exhausts the stack, so the program reports ERROR 246 where
#       the oracle prints its answer -- the guard fires correctly on a bogus overflow.
# ARM 3 is the LEAK arm and it is the one that matters: it asserts the INVARIANT (the spine does not drift) rather
# than the crash that motivated the row. A cure that repaired only the function-return symptom would leave arm 3
# red. This is hq_U's own lesson from the r12 plane, applied here deliberately: a gate written against a plane must
# assert the plane's invariant at the site that establishes it, not the symptom that led you to it.
#
# ⛔ THE FOUR CONTROL ARMS ARE NOT DECORATION -- each removes ONE ingredient and each PASSES on today's broken tree,
# so a cure that over-corrects (whacking the spine somewhere it was already balanced) reds them while arms 1-3 go
# green. plain-variable subject in a function · array element with a MATCH but no replacement in a function · array
# element with a PLAIN ASSIGNMENT in a function · the IDENTICAL replacement statement at TOP LEVEL. That last one is
# the sibling that pins the activation as the discriminator: the statement is not wrong, its context is.
#
# ⛔⭐ THE CLASS IS WIDER THAN AN ARRAY ELEMENT AND ARM 7 IS WHY THIS MATTERS (hq_S 2026-09-13, measured after hq_U
# took the cure). An INDIRECT REFERENCE subject -- `$NM  LEN(1) . S1  REM . S2  =  S2  S1` inside a function -- has the
# IDENTICAL signature: SIGSEGV where the oracle prints BCA, and green at top level. So the discriminator is a COMPUTED
# LVALUE (subscripted OR indirect), not a subscript. A cure that keys on the subscript node alone passes arms 1-2 and
# leaves gimpel PEEL_driver.sno dead -- PEEL.sno:26 is `$NAME.  LEN(K1.) . PEEL  =` inside a function, the indirect
# spelling. Arm 7 exists so that cure cannot read as complete.
#
# ⛔ COVERAGE NOTE, measured and worth more than the gate: corpus/tests/snobol4/ALL.sno contains ZERO entries whose
# replacement subject is subscripted, which is exactly why the SNOBOL4 master reads clean while gimpel PERMS_driver
# SIGSEGVs. A green board is necessary, never sufficient. Adding a master witness is hq_S's suite-gap row and waits
# on the cure -- a red entry in the master is not a cure and must not land as one.
#
# Every arm compares against the ORACLE's own output, refs cut from it ON THIS RUN, never from our output; the
# oracle is run TWICE per witness and diffed against ITSELF first, refusing rc=2 if it differs.
# EXIT: 0 all arms · 1 an arm failed · 2 REFUSED (cannot measure).
