# THE DEFECT THIS PINS (measured 2026-09-10, hq_I, SCRIP 3bbdfc8c7): rt_big_arith_route returned
# FAILDESCR for EVERY x ^ v with v a large integer, so all sixteen of lgint's bigexp rows printed
# "error 204" -- and the 204 was not even raised, it was the STALE &errornumber left by an earlier
# real overflow. Three separate wrongs wearing one face: no error raised, the wrong number reported,
# and five exactly-computable answers (0^v, 1^v, -1^v, and |x|>=2 with v<0) refused.
#
# ⛔ WHY THIS GATE HAS TWO KINDS OF ARM, AND WHY THAT IS NOT A HEDGE.
# lgint cannot be graded against Arizona iconx as a whole: iconx does not reject a 20-digit exponent,
# so at "-2 ^ 36472996377170786403" it starts squaring bignums toward a ~10^19-bit result and never
# returns (600 s cap, 142 of 452 lines; ceo NOTE on the baton). That is UNBOUNDED, not slow. But the
# unboundedness is confined to |base| >= 2 with a POSITIVE huge exponent -- every other row answers
# instantly. So this gate does NOT fall back to the shipped ref wholesale; it grades against the live
# oracle everywhere the oracle can answer (ARM A, 14 rows) and leans on the CEO-491 jcon-provenance
# ruling ONLY for the four rows that provably cannot be measured (ARM B). Naming which rows are which
# is the point: "the oracle cannot finish this program" is true and would have licensed grading all
# eighteen off jcon, which would have imported jcon's divergences as if they were Icon's semantics.
#
# ARM A -- ORACLE-GRADED, LIVE (never hardcoded): bases -1, 0, 1 for all three v; bases -2, 2 for the
#   NEGATIVE v (bounded: the result truncates to 0); and the real base -1.0 for all three v. The real
#   row is the subtle one -- v = 36472996377170786403 is odd, but AS A DOUBLE it rounds to
#   36472996377170788352, which is EVEN, so C pow() on the converted exponent answers +1.0 where Icon
#   answers -1.0. The parity that governs is the parity of the INTEGER, and this arm is what holds
#   that, since a plausible "just call pow()" cure passes every other row here.
# ARM B -- JCON-PROVENANCE (CEO-491), the four unmeasurable rows: |base| >= 2 with a positive huge
#   exponent raises 203 (integer overflow), NOT 204 (real overflow). &errornumber is PRIMED to 204
#   first -- deliberately the very number the bug printed -- so a regression to "nothing was raised,
#   the stale &errornumber was reported" reads 204 here and goes RED. Without that priming this arm
#   would pass against the very bug it exists to catch. (The prime uses 0 ^ -1, whose 204 is oracle-
#   verified by test_gate_icn_pow_error_cases.sh. 1 / 0 CANNOT be used: SCRIP does not honour &error
#   for integer division by zero -- a separate open defect hq_I named to the ceo 2026-09-10.)
#
# ⛔ READ THE NUMBER, NEVER THE MESSAGE SHAPE (RULES.md THE INSTRUMENT LAWS, EIGHTEENTH BATCH,
# CEO-510): every arm compares a VALUE the program itself printed via &errornumber, so a change to the
# fatal-report format cannot turn this red while the semantics are right.
# ⛔ A GATE THAT CANNOT MEASURE REFUSES rc=2 -- all 36 runs (18 rows x 2 modes) must be graded.
# ⭐ NEGATIVE-TESTED AS A DISCRIMINATOR, not merely watched go green (CEO-510): the two source files
# were restored to their pre-cure content, the runtime rebuilt, and this gate run again -- rc=1, RED
# on BOTH arms in BOTH modes, with armB reading exactly "num=204" (the stale &errornumber) and armA
# missing all nine exact-value rows. Cured tree: rc=0. So it can fail, and it fails on the real bug.
