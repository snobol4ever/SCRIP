# test_gate_same_suite_ref_agreement.sh -- THE SAME-SUITE TWIN of test_gate_cross_suite_ref_agreement.sh:
# TWO ENTRIES IN ONE MASTER MUST NOT HOLD CONTRADICTORY REFS FOR A BYTE-IDENTICAL PROGRAM.
#
# ⛔ WHY THIS EXISTS (hq_B's find 2026-09-04, routed by ceo, task
# same-suite-contradictory-refs-gate-two-entries-one-program-two-answers): the Icon master held
# contradictory refs for one program that appeared TWICE UNDER TWO NAMES IN THE SAME MASTER (not one master
# vs a sibling suite, which the cross-suite gate already covers) -- and the cross-suite gate cannot see it,
# because its whole method is comparing ACROSS suites via the ALL.csv `origin` linkage; two entries that
# both live directly in ALL.<ext> never go through that linkage at all. Same defect class as row ICN4
# (a ref disagreement is invisible until something asks the ORACLE, and this gate still cannot say which
# side is right -- only that a disagreement exists), one level down: WITHIN a suite, not just between two.
#
# ⛔⭐ READS EVERY MASTER THROUGH corpus_suite_harness.py's OWN reader, NEVER A HAND-ROLLED BANNER REGEX
# (CLAUDE.md: shared authorities are sourced, never reimplemented). The seven languages do NOT share one
# banner syntax -- each master is delimited in ITS OWN comment style (icon/raku/rebus `#`, prolog `%`,
# pascal `{...}`, snocone `/*...*/`, snobol4 bare `*` one-line-tagged format A, no LANG_CONFIGS entry at
# all) -- and a single `#`-prefixed regex, tried first while building this row, silently parsed only 3 of
# 7 masters to zero visible error: the other four just produced zero sections and read as "nothing to
# compare" instead of REFUSING. `corpus_suite_harness.read_suite`/`read_block_suite` already carry the
# real per-dialect banner_re (via LANG_CONFIGS) AND the SNOBOL4 format-A/format-B mix, are exercised by
# the actual master builder (util_build_master_suite.py) on every push, and already parse the `.wantrc`
# sidecar into `Entry.want_rc` -- so this gate does not re-derive any of that, it asks the one place that
# already knows.
#
# METHOD: within each language's own master, group entries by their SOURCE BODY (banner/name excluded --
# that is what the shared reader already returns as `Entry.sno_lines`). Two or more entries sharing one
# body are, by construction, the same program under different names. For every such group, sharing the
# same `modes` value (ALL.csv) -- never comparing an ast-graded entry's parse-tree dump against a
# run-graded entry's program output, which would be a real difference for a fake reason -- their ref
# bodies (progname-normalized, same reasoning as the cross-suite gate: a program that echoes
# &progname/its own name is not disagreeing, it is naming itself) and their `want_rc` must all agree. A
# group that does not is a contradiction: at least one ref or want_rc is wrong, named entry-vs-entry so
# the reader can take it to the oracle directly, exactly as the cross-suite gate's own closing line says.
#
# EXIT 0 no contradictions (over a real, nonzero population); 1 at least one contradiction (names them);
# 2 REFUSED -- cannot measure (no language's master was readable, or the population was empty: a green
# here would be an empty claim, same vacuity guard as the cross-suite gate).
