# test_gate_score_row_denominator_includes_xfails.sh -- ROW-LEVEL GATE: EVERY SUITES.tsv ROW'S PUBLISHED DENOMINATOR IS
# THE CEO-749 IDENTITY  PASS + FAIL + OUTSIDE-BASELINE + UNGRADABLE + UNGRADED + DEFERRED == population,
# re-derived from the progress DB on the row's OWN tree plus the suite's OUTSIDE sidecar (coo, CEO-780b, 2026-09-16;
# row test-gate-score-row-denominator-includes-xfails-refuses-on-every-tree-under-ceo-753-rewrite-it-to-police-the-ceo-749-identity).
#
# ⛔ WHAT THIS FILE USED TO ASSERT, AND WHY IT IS GONE: hq_T's 2026-09-08 gate (on the coo's ask; CEO-416 "an xfail counts as a
# FAIL, so it sits in the denominator") read a RUNNER-PUBLISHED `xfail=` count out of SCORE.md's Master board cell and checked
# total >= pass + xfail. Under CEO-753 (2026-09-14) THERE IS NO XFAIL -- the builder that mints one is the defect and no master
# cell publishes an xfail= count -- so from that day the gate REFUSED rc=2 on every tree (measured 2026-09-16 11:1x on 61315eaa9
# and 11:21 on 0a3f38904): a standing rc=2 in `make test` for ten seats, asking for a number the law forbids. The property it
# protected (a known red stays in the denominator) is now the wider CEO-749 identity, and the evidence is the DB, not a cell.
#
# HOW A ROW IS GRADED: on the row's tree (SUITES.tsv column `tree`) every progress row of the suite in m3/m4 gives each program
# its LAST outcome per mode; a program is PASS when every mode it declares reads PASS, OUTSIDE when any mode reads OUTSIDE or
# the suite's sidecar names it, DEFERRED when any mode reads DEFERRED, UNGRADABLE when every mode reads UNGRADABLE, UNGRADED when
# every mode reads UNGRADED/SKIP/MISSING/UNPROVEN, else FAIL (FAIL, CRASH, HANG, REJECT, REFUSE, XFAIL, or a mixed pair);
# sidecar entries with no DB row are OUTSIDE too. The population is the union, and the row AGREES when its published total
# equals it. A row whose tree has NO DB rows is UNPROVEN and NAMED (CEO-750: a row without per-program evidence is DARK wearing
# a number); a row with no tree and a DEFERRED criterion (gnu_fd, CEO-579) is DEFERRED by ruling and agrees when its total is
# the deferred count it states. THE NUMERATOR is not this gate's question: util_suite_rows_vs_progress.py (the batch audit,
# CEO-780a) reads pass vs DB PASS, with the xpass discriminator (the DB folds XPASS into PASS, a board does not -- hq_snocone).
#
# VERDICT: rc=0 when every graded row agrees (population printed: graded, agree, disagree named, unproven named); rc=1 under
# --strict when a graded row DISAGREES (each named with its total, the DB population and the difference by class); without
# --strict a disagreement is PRINTED and the rc stays 0 -- report-only in `make test` today because the SNOBOL4 package rows
# disagree by a class the runners themselves split (row snobol4-three-runners-split-ungraded-between-inventory-and-append,
# hq_snobol4) and a blocking red there would dark every arm after it for ten seats; the row that flips this arm to --strict is
# minted when that row closes. rc=2 ONLY when zero rows are gradable (no SUITES.tsv, no DB, or no row with DB rows on its tree).
# --selftest builds a scratch SUITES.tsv, DB and corpus under mktemp with one agreeing row, one DEFERRED row and ONE PLANTED
# DISAGREEMENT, and proves: report mode prints the planted row and exits 0, --strict exits 1 naming it, an empty DB exits 2.
