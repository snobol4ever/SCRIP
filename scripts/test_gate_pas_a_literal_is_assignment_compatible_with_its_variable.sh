# test_gate_pas_a_literal_is_assignment_compatible_with_its_variable.sh -- ISO 7185 6.4.6 via 6.8.2.2 and 6.8.3.9, refused at compile time
#
# MEASURED 2026-09-23 by hq_pascal on SCRIP eb9d2f411, both modes, row pascal-all-test-suites-of-the-language-read-100-percent-on-the-
# suite-table-the-home-stretch (class row pascal-pat-static-type-and-parameter-checking). The expression of an assignment-statement
# (6.8.2.2) and the initial-value and final-value of a for-statement (6.8.3.9) shall be assignment-compatible with the variable's type
# (6.4.6). Nothing compared them: PAT iso7185prt1749 (a := 'c', a: integer), 1824 (i := 1.0), 1752 (for a := 'c' to 10) and 1753
# (for a := 1 to true) compiled and ran.
#
# ⭐ WHAT THE CHECK DELIBERATELY DOES NOT CLAIM. It classifies only a value whose type is certain from its shape -- a char literal or
# chr(), a real literal or real constant, the literal true or false, a string of other than one character -- and never an integer
# literal, because an enumerated, Boolean or char constant defined through another constant also lowers to one. A relational
# expression is NOT treated as Boolean: an FPC typecast lowers to its argument, so LongWord(i1 < i2) arrives looking like a relation
# (measured: without that restriction tbs_tb0601 and test_cg_tcnvint1 were refused). The variable's type must agree across EVERY
# declaration of its name in the flat type table, and an array variable is never checked (the table records a char array under its
# component type). Before landing, every acceptance program in the corpus (PasM, the FPC suite, P4, P5, the benchmarks, 456 programs)
# was compiled with the check: the refused set was identical to the tree before, so the check cannot move another suite's row.
#
# ARMS: four vendored PAT witnesses, each required to be REFUSED with a non-empty diagnostic in BOTH modes (m4 compiles, and if the
# compile is accepted, links and runs -- a witness passes that arm if either step refuses). A fifth arm proves the check
# DISCRIMINATES: every legal pairing it could confuse (real := integer, char := chr(), a Boolean constant, a string into a packed char
# array, for-statements over char, Boolean, enumerated and integer control variables) runs byte-identical to fpc -Miso in both modes.
# A sixth arm is COMPILE-ONLY: a global integer x shadowed by a local x: char must be ACCEPTED, as fpc -Miso accepts it (its output is
# not graded here -- the flat type table is a named open defect). FAIL_ONCE=1 flips the first witness to prove the arm can fail.
