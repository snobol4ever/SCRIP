# Lon 2026-09-03 20:45: "100% means 100% of the industry standard language." For Prolog the standard is ISO/IEC 13211-1
# and the public suite that grades it is the INRIA suite (Deransart / Ed-Dbali / Cervoni), vendored at
# corpus/packages/prolog/inriasuite (see its README and PROVENANCE.txt). 445 goals across 67 builtin-family files.
#
# ⛔⭐ WHAT THIS GRADES, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT -- stated here and in the board line, because a conformance number that
# overstates itself is worse than no number. It compares the OUTCOME CLASS of each goal: success vs failure vs error,
# and for an error the ERROR TERM'S FUNCTOR (type_error, instantiation_error, ...). It does NOT compare substitution
# bindings, so a goal expected to yield [[X <-- a]] scores as a pass if it merely SUCCEEDS, whatever it bound.
# That is strictly weaker than the suite's own criterion. Tightening it can only ever move the number DOWN.
