# test_gate_gc_no_pinned_lifetime_class.sh -- THE PINNING MECHANISM IS DELETED AND CANNOT COME BACK UNDER ITS OLD
# SPELLINGS (cfo 2026-09-16, THE COLLECTOR, CEO-799; Lon in-chat to ceo 14:5x CDT, verbatim: "Just so we are clear.
# Delete the mechanism of the pinning FIRST. THen go figure how to fix it.").
#
# WHAT WAS DELETED, measured at 14:58 CDT on origin f587b10e5: 458 spellings in 27 files under src/ -- rt_pinned_alloc /
# rt_pinned_alloc_tag / rt_pinned_realloc / rt_pinned_strdup (the allocator that minted HB_WS / HB_WSS blocks),
# hb_no_move (the forward pass forwarded a marked block of those types TO ITSELF so it never slid), hb_root_blanket +
# SCRIP_GC_PIN_AGGREGATES (a blanket mark of every such block, the immortal policy), gc_unpin_wss_on +
# SCRIP_GC_UNPIN_WSS (the test-only knob that let names slide), HB_WSS itself, the rtx_alloc.s entry that jumped to the
# C allocator, and the rtx unit arms that paired them. Every site is now ORDINARY COLLECTED ALLOCATION: rt_ws_alloc
# (HB_WS: moves, is reclaimed when unmarked, interior conservatively scanned and its slots relocated), rt_ws_realloc,
# rt_heap_strdup_c (HB_WSC, a leaf C string), or rt_gcheap_alloc(HB_ARR|HB_DINST, n) for the aggregates that have a
# precise visitor. No block type is exempt from the slide; the forward pass has ONE marked-block branch.
#
# ARMS: (1) CENSUS -- the spellings above under src/ read 0 (the arm the ceo asked for: the mechanism cannot return by
# name); (2) STRUCTURAL -- gc_heap.c contains no self-forward of a title (fwd = h) so no type is exempt from the slide;
# ⛔⭐ (5) PROPERTY and (6) PLANTED, added by the cfo 2026-09-17 under CEO-831 on LON's ORDER ("Get rid of any code that
# pins blocks in the GC"), because ARMS 1 AND 2 CATCH THE MECHANISM AS IT WAS WRITTEN AND NOT THE PROPERTY THEY EXIST TO
# PROTECT. A block can be pinned WITHOUT ever self-forwarding and WITHOUT any known spelling: leave it marked and simply
# SKIP it in the forwarding pass. It keeps its address, the self-forward grep never matches, and the name census cannot
# know a name nobody has invented yet. The collector now counts marked blocks and forwarded blocks INDEPENDENTLY, prints
# both on the [ZGC] line, and prints a loud [ZGC-PIN] VIOLATION whenever they differ. Arm 5 asserts the equality; arm 6
# PLANTS a skip through the test-only cached-getenv seam SCRIP_GC_PLANT_PIN_SKIP and requires the arm to FIRE, because a
# guard never seen to fire is not known to hold. Measured on the churn witness: clean reads marked=437 forwarded=437 on
# every collection; SCRIP_GC_PLANT_PIN_SKIP=3 reads 437/436 with the violation line on every collection.
# (3) BEHAVIOURAL, both modes -- a live TABLE, ARRAY and DATA record survive 30000 statements of 20 KB string churn
# (four collections, SCRIP_ZETA_TELEM counts them; zero is a vacuous run) and print byte-identical to sbl. The
# behavioural arm is deliberately UNSTRESSED: under SCRIP_GC_STRESS=20 this witness SEGVs both modes on the deletion
# tree (a cure row, minted with the landing), and a gate that reds on a known open row blocks the set for nothing.
# FAIL-ONCE, 2026-09-16: arm 1 read 458 on origin f587b10e5, arm 2 read 1 (gc_collect_ex line 686). PASS-ONCE: 0 / 0 /
# both modes rc=0 identical to the oracle across 4 collections on the deletion tree.
