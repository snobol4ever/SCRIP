# ⛔⭐ CONTROL EDGES LIVE ON PORTS (ceo CEO-696, on Lon's 2026-09-13 word that SCRIP uses a
# PHYSICAL GRAPH AND TEMPLATES and has no labels -- "that is JCON. Totally different.").
#
# THE TEST THIS ENFORCES (CEO-695): IF A NODE'S CONTROL EDGES CANNOT BE FOLLOWED BY THE
# WALKER'S ORDINARY PORT RULE, IT IS NOT A NODE -- it is an instruction wearing a node's
# shape, and it belongs in a template.
#
# ⛔ WHY A RATCHET AND NOT A BAN: an operand push is not automatically the defect. Three of
# the four live cases are sub-expression or sub-graph REACHABILITY -- IR_CREATE's operand is
# a co-expression body with its own coret/cofail, a genuine separate graph root; IR_SUSPEND's
# is its value expression; IR_REPALT's is an alternation body entry whose re-entry is that
# construct's own semantics (MEASURED 2026-09-13: `every write(|1 \ 3)` matches icont, so it
# is green and is not to be "cured"). Only IR_MOVE_LABEL carried genuine CONTINUATIONS --
# the arms a gate jumps through -- which a port should have carried; Lon ordered it deleted
# (CEO-693/695) and it is the witness this gate is built from.
#
# ⭐ SO THE CEILING FALLS AND NEVER RISES. A NEW op that reaches control through its operand
# list is refused here at mint time, which is the only moment it is cheap -- reviewing the
# NAME would never have caught IR_MOVE_LABEL, and did not, for as long as it existed.
