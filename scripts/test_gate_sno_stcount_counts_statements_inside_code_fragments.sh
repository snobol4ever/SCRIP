# test_gate_sno_stcount_counts_statements_inside_code_fragments.sh -- &STCOUNT counts the statements
# executed inside a CODE()-compiled fragment, and counts the SAME number of them as SPITBOL does, in BOTH
# modes. (hq_S 2026-09-13, row snobol4-stcount-diverges-in-m4-from-m3-and-the-oracle-inside-code-eval-
# compiled-statements.)
#
# THE CLASS. A CODE() fragment is parsed and lowered AT RUN TIME. The lowerer chooses between the counted
# SNO$STMT hook and the cheap inline statement mark from g_sno_uses_stmtkw, which it seeds from the
# SCRIP_SNO_STMTKW environment variable. In mode 3 the main program was lowered in the SAME process, so
# that seed is already set when the fragment is lowered; in mode 4 it was set in the compiler's process
# and died with it, so every statement executed inside CODE() went UNCOUNTED and &STCOUNT drifted low.
# It surfaced in AIS ATN as a WRONG ANSWER rather than as a counter reading, because ATN's own GENNAME
# mints generated node names out of &STCOUNT -- the program encodes the statement counter into its output.
#
# ⛔ WHY THIS GATE PINS VALUES AND NOT A DIFF. The row's symptom was an m3-vs-m4 diff, and a build that had
# simply stopped counting statements ALTOGETHER would make that diff vanish too -- both modes agreeing on a
# wrong number is not a cure. So every arm here compares SCRIP's &STCOUNT against the ORACLE's own reading
# of the same program, and arm 2 sweeps the amount of work inside the fragment so the count has to TRACK
# the oracle across a range rather than match it at one point. That is the boundary shape CEO-678 named for
# limit, size and depth rows, applied to a counter: a verdict arm asks "did it count?", a boundary arm asks
# "did it count the right number, everywhere?".
#
# REFS ARE CUT FROM THE ORACLE on every run (sbl -bf, the shared correctness oracle) and never from our own
# output. The witnesses are deterministic -- no TIME(), no DATE(), no input -- so the oracle is its own ref;
# that is checked, not assumed, by running the oracle twice and diffing it against itself before any
# comparison is made (the prophylactic from
