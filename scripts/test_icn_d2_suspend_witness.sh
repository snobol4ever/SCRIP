# test_icn_d2_suspend_witness.sh -- THE D2-SUSPEND WITNESS SET: the acceptance instrument for N-2 (generator ACTIVATION FRAMES).
#
# ⭐ WHY THIS EXISTS. icn_genframe2() (src/templates/x86_asm.h) carries its own release criterion in its comment:
# "⛔ DEFAULT OFF until all five slices land and the D2-suspend witness set is green". That set had no runnable artifact --
# the criterion named a thing that did not exist, so "is it green?" could only ever be answered by hand, per session, from memory.
# This script IS that set. Flip the gate when this prints ALL-GREEN, and not before.
#
# ⛔⭐ THE ONE THING THIS INSTRUMENT MUST DO THAT A PASS/FAIL HARNESS CANNOT: DISTINGUISH THREE STATES, NOT TWO.
#   CRASH   -- the program died (SIGSEGV/SIGBUS/timeout). Loud. Can never be mistaken for a pass.
#   WRONG   -- the program ran to rc=0 and printed the WRONG BYTES (very often: nothing at all).
#   CORRECT -- byte-identical to the Arizona oracle.
# Measured hq_P s273: arming the gate on `suspend 1` moves it CRASH -> WRONG (empty write where the oracle prints "1"),
# because the frame carve works but the yielded DESCRIPTOR never reaches the caller landing.
# ⛔ A two-state harness scores that as an IMPROVEMENT -- no crash, rc=0 -- and bench_correct compares OUTPUT, so an empty
# write is scoreable as a pass in a way a SIGSEGV never is. TRADING A LOUD FAILURE FOR A QUIET ONE IS A REGRESSION HERE.
# That is the whole reason this file is three-state and why it must stay three-state.
#
# ⛔ REFUSES rc=2 WHEN IT CANNOT MEASURE -- never skip-as-success (RULES.md; Lon flagged the vacuous-test class by name s273).
# A missing oracle, a compiler that will not build, an unassemblable .s: each is a REFUSAL, never a quietly smaller board.
#
# ⛔ NEVER read $? through a pipe -- that reports the PIPE's status. This cost hq_P a false rc=0 on a run that had SIGSEGV'd
# (CLAUDE.md names the trap verbatim). Every exit code below is captured directly off the command, never through `| tr`.
# ⛔ stdout and stderr are captured SEPARATELY -- a 2>&1-merged stream is NOT an observation of stdout, and reading one as the
# other nearly produced a false "m3 != m4 invariant violation" report the same session.
#
# ⛔⭐ EVERY WITNESS RUNS $REPS TIMES (default 5), AND ANY SINGLE CRASH CONDEMNS THE ROW. THIS IS NOT BELT-AND-BRACES --
# IT IS THE POINT. Measured hq_P s273 on the ARMED protocol: mode-3 is rc=0 twenty times out of twenty, but mode-4 SEGFAULTS
# INTERMITTENTLY -- 1/20 re-running one binary, 4/20 with a fresh build each time (~20%). A single-shot harness sees green
# four times out of five and calls the protocol ready.
# ⭐ AN INTERMITTENT CRASH IS THE WORST STATE ON THIS BOARD, WORSE THAN A RELIABLE ONE: a reliably-broken thing is fixed the
# first day, a flaky one is blamed on the box and survives for months. An instrument that samples once cannot tell the two
# apart, so it would have had the exact defect it exists to catch.
#
# USAGE:  bash scripts/test_icn_d2_suspend_witness.sh            # grade the gate's CURRENT default (off)
#         SCRIP_ICN_GENFRAME2=1 bash scripts/test_icn_d2_suspend_witness.sh   # grade the ARMED protocol -- N-2's real question
#         REPS=20 SCRIP_ICN_GENFRAME2=1 bash scripts/...        # more samples: raise REPS before trusting any green
# EXIT:   0 = every witness CORRECT in both modes (the gate may flip) | 1 = at least one CRASH/WRONG | 2 = REFUSED, could not measure.

# ⛔⭐ APPLY (`!`) TO A GENERATOR -- this witness set flipped the gate default-ON (ceo s283f) with ZERO
# coverage of this shape (measured hq_B 2026-08-29: this file's only two `!` characters, before this
# witness, were the shebang and a `!=` inside a comment). bb_call_value.cpp (the `!`-apply call-emission
# template) has zero N-2 awareness -- RULES.md § INSTRUMENT LAWS FIFTH BATCH, witness D: a gate that had
# no capacity to fail on the one broken shape was not evidence that shape worked. See row
# icon-d2-witness-never-exercises-apply-the-shape-it-accepted (this widening) and
# icon-apply-to-generator-segv-bb-call-value-has-no-n2-awareness (the emitter cure, tracked separately --
# do NOT fix bb_call_value.cpp here, this file is the instrument, not the cure).
# ⛔⭐ WATCHED TO FAIL — RECORDED HERE BECAUSE THE EVIDENCE IS PERISHABLE (hq_B, 2026-08-29T21:1xZ).
# The row that demanded this witness made one clause non-negotiable: the widened script must be seen to go RED
# on the apply case BEFORE any cure lands, because a widened witness that is green on its first run has not
# been shown to test anything. ceo disclosed honestly that the STANDALONE witness was watched to fail
# extensively pre-cure (rc=139, 5/5, plus a killswitch-off control) but that this INTEGRATED spelling was born
# post-cure and had never been seen red THROUGH THIS SCRIPT. Those are different claims: the first proves the
# SHAPE is detectable, the second proves THIS FILE'S OWN GRADING PATH reaches it.
# ⛔⭐ NAMING AN ABSENT SYMBOL MANUFACTURES EVIDENCE OF ITS PRESENCE — a defect hq_B created here and then
# fell for (2026-08-29). The cure ceo's FINDING credits is identified by a symbol that HAS NEVER EXISTED IN
# ANY SOURCE FILE, in any commit. Writing that name into this comment made it grep-findable, and a later
# `git log --all -S<symbol>` returned exactly one hit — THIS COMMENT — which read as 'it was committed once'.
# seat03 measured it correctly and independently (suspend_apply CRASH 5/5 both modes) and said the cure never
# landed; they were right. Four documents now name that symbol and NONE of them is an implementation.
# ⭐ THE RULE: when you record that something is ABSENT, do not spell its identifier in a way that a search
# for the identifier will find and count as a sighting. Describe it instead, or mark the mention as prose.
# The symbol in question is the N-2 spine-enter entrypoint named in that FINDING; it is deliberately NOT
# spelled here. Check for the cure by BEHAVIOUR (run this script) rather than by grepping for a name.
# MEASURED on a pre-cure tree (SCRIP 68046fa3; the cure's symbol absent from src/templates/bb/bb_call_value.cpp,
# = 0, i.e. the cure demonstrably absent), running this script unmodified:
#     suspend_apply    m3=CRASH   (crash 2/2  ) m4=CRASH   (crash 2/2  ) m3=m4     -> ⛔ NOT GREEN
# So the slot is live, reaches the compiler, and can report failure on exactly the shape it was added for.
# ⭐ WHY IT IS WRITTEN DOWN RATHER THAN LEFT AS A RE-RUN: this reading exists only while a tree without the
# cure exists. Once every seat pulls, nobody can reproduce it without a deliberate checkout, and "we watched
# it fail" becomes an assertion instead of a record. A negative result that cannot be re-obtained must be
# recorded at the moment it is cheap.
mkw suspend_apply 'procedure gen(x)

# ⭐ CONTROL ARMS -- these already pass and MUST keep passing. Arming the gate must be INERT outside generator procedures;
# if one of these moves, the protocol has reached code it does not own and the result is a regression, not a cure.
