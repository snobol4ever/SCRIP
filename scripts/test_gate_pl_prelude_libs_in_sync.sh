# test_gate_pl_prelude_libs_in_sync.sh -- THE VENDORED SWI LIBRARIES AND THE TABLE SCRIP EMBEDS AGREE (cfo 2026-10-10, row
# prolog-swi-library-modules-rbtrees-assoc-ordsets-apply-error-pairs-aggregate-option-strings-516-swi-cases; CEO-1473).
#
# THE RULING (CEO-1473): swipl's pure-Prolog libraries are vendored under src/parsers/prolog/prelude/<lib>.pl with their BSD
# headers and embedded by a generator at build like the parsers.  The generator is scripts/util_gen_prolog_prelude_libs.py;
# its product src/parsers/prolog/prolog_prelude_libs.inc is committed, as the parsers' .tab.c are, so a vendored file
# changed without regenerating (or a table edited by hand) would ship a library SCRIP's source no longer states.
#
# THE ARMS. (1) --check over the committed tree: rc 0 in sync, rc 1 STALE.  (0) SELF-TEST, every run, on scratch copies: a
# table that differs from what the generator writes must read STALE; a vendored file that is no longer byte-identical to
# swipl's own copy must refuse rc=2 by that reason (the predicate references and meta-predicate declarations are read
# from swipl's copy, so a vendored file that drifted would be renamed by the wrong reading); an unknown directive must
# refuse rc=2 by name (a directive is never dropped silently).  An instrument that cannot see its plants proves nothing by
# passing: the gate refuses.  Needs swipl (the generator reads every library with SWI's own reader), no build; ~2 s.
# rc=0 in sync · rc=1 stale · rc=2 refused.
