"""Census every activation-frame word the frame allocator lays out against its zls_field registration.

THE CLAIM UNDER TEST (ARCH-GC-COMPILE-TIME-FRAME-MAPS.md section 7 F1, the collector guesses nothing): every
word of an emitted frame that the collector will ever read carries a kind the compiler wrote down at compile
time.  frame_layout.c is where that kind is written (zls_field: offset, size, ZK_DESCR|ZK_RAW|ZK_PTR_GC|
ZK_PTR_CODE), and `scrip --dump-zeta` prints the table it wrote.  This census reads that table for every
graph of every program it is pointed at and reports every word the table does NOT account for:

  region-gap        a byte in [0, region_end) of the graph that no scope's field covers (the classic hole:
                    the return-value cell IR_RETURN writes at frame +0 was never registered -- found by this
                    census on the Raku master, ceo 2026-09-17, CEO-820)
  scope-gap         a byte inside a scope's [lo, hi) between two registered fields
  overlap           a byte two fields of one scope both claim (two kinds for one word)
  vslot-unmapped    a named variable slot (vslot) not covered by exactly one field
  provisional-kind  a field printed with `(audit)` -- a kind nobody verified against the template
  unknown-kind      a kind name outside the four the enum defines

WHAT IT DOES NOT SEE, SAID HERE SO NOBODY READS A CLEAN CENSUS AS A CLEAN FRAME: the emitter's wire header
beyond region_end (the saved gamma/omega continuations and the saved rsp the prologue stores, 48 or 80 bytes;
FN__add stores rcx/rdx/rsp at +120/+128/+136 of a 144-byte frame whose zls region ends at 96) is not in the
zls table and is the cto's per-frame map cell (F6 step 2).  Nor does it see the spine (F1 tagged cells).
The population is the zls REGION, and the summary line says so.

POPULATION: one master suite (--lang, extracted in-process through the harness's own readers, the ONE
extraction authority) or explicit --files.  An entry the compiler refuses (no `; graph` line, or rc != 0)
is NO LAYOUT, named and counted beside the verdict, never silently dropped and never graded green.
⛔⭐ A NO-LAYOUT ROW PRINTS rc WITH THE FIRST LINE OF THE REFUSAL, because `rc=1` alone is a bucket and not a
member (the coo's instrument bar, 2026-09-20: every bucket a fleet instrument prints must be answerable to
"name one member of this count").  It also keeps a RED apart from a COULD-NOT-MEASURE, which is the split the
Makefile holds everywhere else.  MEASURED THE HOUR IT LANDED (hq_snobol4, SCRIP 553678ec2 / corpus 86574b2bf,
RT_OPT=-O0), the whole remaining fleet bucket named in one command: snobol4's 1 is
`rc=1: FATAL lower_snobol4 ... lambda(expr), the CONDITIONAL pattern lambda, is not implemented yet`; raku's 31
are `rc=1: raku parse error line 1: syntax error` on the test_stmt_pfx_BEGIN/_CHECK/_END statement-prefix family;
prolog's 10 are `rc=2: builtin b_getval is not on the ladder yet -- rung 10 lands it`.  42 real, three named
unlanded-feature gaps, no mystery -- and rc=2 there is an honest REFUSAL that a bare `rc=` would have shown as
the same thing as raku's red.
rc 0 = graded > 0 and holes == 0; rc 1 = holes > 0; rc 2 = nothing graded (the denominator is zero).
Set ZLS_LIST_ALL=1 to print every hole (the default caps the listing).
THE MACHINE-READ LINE, frozen for the coo's maps census (CEO-821): one per run,
  ZLS-MAP lang=<l> graphs=<n> words=<n> unkinded=<n> holes=<n> graded=<n> no_layout=<n> no_layout_declared=<n>
    no_layout_never_emitted=<n> no_layout_emitted_no_layout=<n> no_layout_unmeasured=<n>

⛔⭐ THE THREE KIND FIELDS, AND WHY THE DISCRIMINATOR IS NOT THE rc (cto 2026-09-20, building CEO-1025 and
correcting its discriminator on the data).  The ruling is right that `no_layout` CONFLATES TWO POPULATIONS WITH
OPPOSITE OWNERS: (a) the compiler REFUSED the entry, so nothing was emitted, there is no leaf boundary and no
store -- a COMPLETENESS debt wearing a GC census's clothes; and (b) the compiler EMITTED the graph and the planner
gave it no frame layout -- boundaries exist, they store into unmapped slots, and THAT is the correctness
population that gates completeness under MODE TENET condition 1.  ⛔ THE RULING NAMED rc=2 AGAINST rc=1 AS THE
SPLIT AND THE DATA SAYS OTHERWISE: prolog's ten read `rc=2 builtin X is not on the ladder yet`, and raku's seven
read `rc=1 raku parse error` / `lex error` / a role-composition refusal.  BOTH ARE REFUSALS THAT EMIT NOTHING, so
rc=1 against rc=2 separates a ladder refusal from a parser refusal -- two flavours INSIDE bucket (a) -- and not
(a) from (b).  The fact the ruling actually asked for is DID THIS ENTRY PRODUCE EMITTED CODE AT ALL, and this
census has always known it directly: a non-zero rc from `--dump-zeta` is NEVER-EMITTED, rc=0 with no frame layout
in the dump is EMITTED-NO-LAYOUT, and a timeout is UNMEASURED and is folded into neither.  The kind is returned as
a VALUE by dump_one and never re-parsed out of the message text, because a guard keyed on a spelling is a
coincidence and not a guard.  The three sum to `no_layout` and the census REFUSES rc=2 if they do not, because an
entry placed in no bucket vanishes from both owners' work lists.
⛔ A DECLARED entry keeps the `NO-LAYOUT ` LINE PREFIX and carries [DECLARED wantrc=N] in its tail; the declaration is NEVER a
new line prefix.  The coo's util_gc_census.py cross-checks no_layout=N against the number of lines starting `NO-LAYOUT ` and
REFUSES when they disagree -- measured 2026-09-20: a first cut of this field used a NO-LAYOUT-DECLARED prefix, the consumer
counted 7 lines against no_layout=9 and refused rc=2.  It was right to.  The sidecar note below uses NO-LAYOUT-SIDECAR (no
space) for the same reason.
no_layout_declared is APPENDED, never inserted: the frozen token and the order and meaning of every field before it are
untouched, and no_layout stays the TOTAL so no consumer silently changes its mind about what it is reading (ceo CEO-1003,
cto's three conditions, 2026-09-20).  It is PRINTED FOR EVERY LANGUAGE INCLUDING ZERO, so a diff of two census lines is a
diff of numbers and never of shapes.  A DECLARED no-layout is an entry the master's own ALL.wantrc gives a NON-ZERO rc:
the suite declares it must not compile, so having no frame is the correct and permanent answer rather than a defect.
words = 8-byte words of every graded graph's zls region; unkinded = words of those inside a reported hole.
Planted arm: SCRIP_TEST_PLANT_ZLS_HOLE=1 makes zls_dump omit the first field of every graph, so a gate can
prove this census still detects a hole the day the real ones are gone (CEO-554: a gate anchored on a found
witness dies when someone cures the witness).
