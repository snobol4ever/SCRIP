# ⛔⭐ R IS COMPUTED FROM THIS SCRIPT'S OWN LOCATION AND MUST STAY THAT WAY (cfo 2026-09-09 17:17). This
# line used to compute R and then immediately reassign it to the literal /home/claude_R, so the gate ran
# THIS author's binary against THIS author's corpus inside every other seat's make test: a green there
# graded a tree nobody was landing, and a red would have been the wrong seat's to explain on their own
# console. A gate that hardcodes one root measures one root, whatever thirteen consoles print.
# ⭐ NOTE THE TWO HALVES ARE ONE DEFECT: cfo's freshness guard (47781cd12) checks the SEAT'S OWN binary,
# and the literal below it pointed the gate body at a DIFFERENT one -- so the guard would have certified
# the caller's tree while the arms graded mine. Both lines have to agree about which root this is, and
# now they do, because there is only one expression for it.
