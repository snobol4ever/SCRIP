# test_gate_icn_string_escapes_match_icont_including_unknown_and_uppercase.sh -- every one-character escape in an Icon string or cset literal means what icont says it means: recognized letters are case-insensitive, \8 and \9 are their digit values, \x is hex but \X is not, and an UNRECOGNIZED escape is the character itself with the backslash dropped (ceo CEO-665).
#
# MEASURED 2026-09-13 on 24f1ec353, found by the image-leak row's own oracle-diff arm: "q\y" imaged as "q\\y" where
# icont says "qy" -- our lexer's default arm KEPT the backslash for an escape it did not recognize, where icont's
# esctab maps an unknown escape to the character itself. Two more defects fell out of the same sweep: the uppercase
# forms \T \N \B \R \V \F \E \D \L were all unrecognized (icont accepts them, its table is case-insensitive), and \X
# was treated as a hex escape though icont's hex escape is lowercase \x only, so "\X" read 0 instead of 'X'.
# THE REF IS THE ORACLE ITSELF: this gate GENERATES a witness that takes ord() of \<c> for every printable c (bar the
# four that cannot be written bare: " \ ' ^), plus a cset literal, an image() of a mixed string, and the multi-char
# escapes \^A \101 \x41, and diffs the whole stream against icont in both modes. FAIL_ONCE=1 corrupts the first line.
