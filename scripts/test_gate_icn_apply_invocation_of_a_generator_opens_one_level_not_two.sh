# test_gate_icn_apply_invocation_of_a_generator_opens_one_level_not_two.sh -- invoking a GENERATOR through
# the apply operator (`p ! args`, and every other route that reaches rt_call_value_gen_h) opened TWO
# activation levels for ONE activation: rt_proc_call_gen_h raised rt_k_level around scrip_coexpr_activate
# AND the coroutine body's own rt_proc_call_open -> rt_proc_call_prologue_lex raised it again through
# rt_lvl_open(own=0), which is the arm a generator always takes. A DIRECT call of the same generator opens
# exactly one, which is why only the apply route was wrong (row: jcon tracing, cfo, under CEO-545).
#
# ⭐ THE VISIBLE FACE WAS THE TRACE INDENT, THE DEFECT WAS &level. The extra level printed one extra "| "
# on the call and on the first suspend, and -- because rt_trace_resume_hook walks g_icn_act DOWNWARD from
# rt_k_level looking for the activation with this name -- it made the "NAME resumed" line report a STALE
# earlier call site's line. Both are cosmetics of one wrong number: measured pre-cure, `&level` read inside
# a generator reached by `g ! args` answered 3 where iconx 9.5.25a answers 2, with the direct call of the
# same procedure answering 2 on both. A2 is the load-bearing arm for exactly that reason -- a cure written
# in the renderer (padding the bars, or re-dating the resume line) greens A1 and leaves A2 red.
#
# ⭐ A3 IS THE OVERSHOOT CONTROL: a NON-generator invoked through the same `!` operator was already right
# (it never enters the coroutine arm at all) and must stay right, so a cure written one layer too wide --
# in rt_call_value_gen_h, or in rt_lvl_open -- is caught here rather than by a suite three hours later.
#
# ⛔ NAMED, NOT CURED, AND NOT HIDDEN: iconx emits NO line marker for an apply-invocation, so its &line
# LAGS -- `every g ! args` on line 6 traces its call at line 5, the previous statement's line, and a bare
# `g ! args` on line 7 traces 5 too (measured, iconx 9.5.25a, 2026-09-11). SCRIP reports the statement's
# OWN line, 6 and 7. A1 is written in the `while ... do every g ! args` shape, where the previous statement
# IS the while header and both sides agree, so this gate grades the level defect and not that one. The lag
# is a separate divergence with its own witness; it is NOT graded here and must not be assumed cured.
#
# ⛔ &trace WRITES ONLY TO stderr; every arm captures 2>&1 for that reason.
# Every .want below is the byte-exact stdout+stderr of icont/iconx 9.5.25a (/home/resources/icon-master/bin).
# EXIT: 0 all six arms byte-identical; 1 a mismatch; 2 REFUSED (no binary, no gcc, stale build).
