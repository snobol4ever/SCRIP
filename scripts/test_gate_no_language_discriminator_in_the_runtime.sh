# test_gate_no_language_discriminator_in_the_runtime.sh -- the runtime must not decide LANGUAGE IDENTITY
# from the VALUE of a global, and the Icon errors that identity currently gates must keep raising.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (row icon-a-language-discriminator-in-the-runtime-gates-whether-errors-are-raised-at-all,
# hq_I census, ceo-verified, hq_U co-signing). src/runtime/core/core.c carries:
#     int core_icn_active(void) { extern long g_stno; extern long g_line; return g_stno == 0 && g_line > 0; }
# and 22 sites across six runtime files branch on it to decide whether Icon run-time errors 201 202 204
# 101 103 110 113 114 are RAISED AT ALL. That is language identity smuggled through two unrelated globals'
# values, past the frontend/lower boundary.
#
# ⛔ THE FAILURE MODE IS WHY THIS IS A GATE AND NOT A CLEANUP. If the discriminator ever reads false under
# Icon, nothing crashes and no board blanks: the errors simply stop being raised and programs return wrong
# values with rc=0. hq_U MEASURED it rather than predicting it -- with the discriminator forced false,
# `pos("a")` under `&error := -1` prints "pos SUCCEEDED", &error stays -1, &errornumber is never recorded,
# and the program exits 0 with a full plausible output.
#
# ⛔ AND THE GUARDS OVERLAP UNEVENLY (hq_U, measured): `tab`/`move` are checked in BOTH icn_argtype_gate
# (NOT guarded by core_icn_active) and core_icn_builtin_argcheck (guarded), so a regression here would not
# break cleanly -- it would shift SOME error numbers and not others, which on a counting file like
# errors.icn reads as mysterious partial drift rather than a switch being off. That is exactly why ARM B
# is BEHAVIOURAL AND PER-ERROR-NUMBER rather than a count: a count cannot tell those two apart.
#
# ⭐ ANCHORED ON THE ORACLE, NOT ON OUR OWN OUTPUT (CEO-554). Every ARM B witness is run through iconx in
# the same invocation and SCRIP is compared against THAT, so curing anything moves both sides together and
# no cure can invalidate this instrument. hq_U lost an open gate this week to exactly that trap.
#
# ⛔ WHAT THIS GATE CAN AND CANNOT DETECT, stated because the gate it replaces did not say so and was
# believed to cover this. test_gate_emit_no_lang.sh scopes to src/emitter and src/templates and greps for
# language-identity NAMES; it is structurally blind here on both counts. ARM A looks in src/runtime and
# matches a PREDICATE SHAPE, which is stronger -- but it is still a source scan, and a discriminator
# spelled a third way would pass it. ARM B is the part that cannot be fooled by spelling.
