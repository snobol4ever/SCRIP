# util_require_fresh.sh -- THE ONE-LINE STALE-BINARY PREFLIGHT, callable from ANY language.
#
# ⛔ THIS FILE CONTAINS NO STALENESS LOGIC AND MUST NEVER GROW ANY. It is a CALLING CONVENTION over
# gate_require_fresh() in lib_gate.sh (hq_B, SCRIP 4c7253e99) -- source it, call it, translate its exit
# code. Every rule about WHAT counts as stale lives in that one function.
#
# ⛔⭐ WHY A SHIM AND NOT A REIMPLEMENTATION -- this is the whole point of the row (harness-and-ladder-
# runner-refuse-on-a-stale-binary-like-the-artifact-regen-does, ceo -> hq_T 2026-09-04). The staleness
# idea ALREADY existed twice in this repo: gate_require_fresh (lib_gate.sh) and assert_binary_current
# (lib_build_currency.sh). ceo cured the commit-time defect in the second (3d12ca54, "IT IS NOT A
# SUPERSET, IT IS WRONG") and the fix never reached the first, so the identical defect regenerated there
# and had to be cured a SECOND time nine days later (4c7253e99). ⭐ THE LESSON THE ROW ENCODES: the cost
# of a copy is not the duplicated lines, it is that a cure applied to one copy STRENGTHENS EVERYONE'S
# BELIEF THE CLASS IS DEAD while the other copy keeps the bug. corpus_suite_harness.py is Python and
# cannot `source` a bash function -- which is exactly the pressure that produces copy number three. This
# file is the answer to that pressure: Python shells out to the SAME function every bash caller runs.
#
# USAGE (all callers, any language):
#     util_require_fresh.sh [--gate <name>] [<artifact> ...]
# With no artifacts it checks the two the whole fleet grades: $SCRIP (default <root>/scrip) and
# $RT_DIR/libscrip_rt.so (default <root>/out) -- the .so because a stale runtime is the FALSE-GREEN half
# of this class (row stale-binary-preflight-also-covers-out-libscrip-rt-so, DONE): a 13:37 .so against a
# 14:16 src read `exec_stmt` as still exported when source had already deleted it.
# --gate <name> names the CALLER in the refusal text; without it the refusal says "util_require_fresh",
# which is the shim, not the instrument that refused -- an unactionable verdict of the kind gate_stamp
# already exists to prevent.
#
# ENV (both live in gate_require_fresh, the one authority -- this shim only passes them through):
#   SCRIP_STALE_PROBE_SRC=<file>  ONE extra "newest source" candidate, for fail-once proofs against a SCRATCH file
#                                 (the ceo's DONE-WHEN contract). It can only TIGHTEN the verdict, never loosen it.
#   SCRIP_ALLOW_STALE=1           the deliberate stale run: a stale artifact PASSES with a loud banner on BOTH streams,
#                                 and gate_score_row refuses to write SCORE.md for the rest of that run. A MISSING
#                                 artifact is never overridable -- nothing ran, so nothing was "deliberately" graded.
# EXIT: 0 every named artifact exists and is newer than every tracked src/+Makefile file · 2 REFUSED
# (missing or stale, cause + cure printed). ⛔ NEVER 1: this cannot say "measured and bad", only
# "measured and current" or "I could not establish what you are about to grade" (lib_gate.sh's three
# exit codes). A missing artifact REFUSES here rather than passing-by-skip -- gate_require_fresh itself
# `continue`s past a nonexistent binary because its production caller checks existence one line earlier,
# and a shim whose callers may not is the wrong place to inherit that assumption.
