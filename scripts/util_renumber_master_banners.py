"""util_renumber_master_banners.py -- THE SANCTIONED RENUMBER PATH for a language master's banner seq
numbers, restoring the invariant `banner number == entry position` across ALL.<ext>, ALL.ref AND ALL.in
together (hq_T 2026-09-13, on the cfo's routed brief "the-sanctioned-add-a-witness-path-is-refusing-on-
five-of-seven-masters-because-the-620-removal-left-the-banner-numbers-stale").

WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL -- THE INVARIANT, AND WHAT BROKE IT: read_block_suite()/read_suite() IGNORE the
number printed in a banner and re-derive seq positionally (`seq += 1`), while write_block_suite()/
write_suite() print e.seq back out. So "banner number == position" is an invariant of every file those
readers have round-tripped, and it is load-bearing for exactly one consumer: util_add_ladder_witness.py's
byte-for-byte ROUND-TRIP PROOF, the check that refuses to trust the tool with a real write until the
reader+writer pair reproduces the existing master byte-for-byte. corpus a6646f04c removed the 620
modes=ast entries from all seven masters WITHOUT renumbering, so every entry after a removal point kept a
banner number one-per-removed-predecessor too high, and the sanctioned add-a-witness path went down for
five of the seven languages at once.

⛔⭐ THE REFUSAL WAS CORRECT AND ITS EXPLANATION WAS FALSE, which is why this sat unnamed for a week and
why the cure is a tool rather than a note. "this language's reader+writer pair does not reproduce the
existing master byte-for-byte" accuses THE TOOL; the fault is in THE FILE. Three lanes (raku corpus
02d2e456e, snocone 53fd3d903, snobol4 a401e1e3e) each independently paid the same diagnosis and then each
hand-renumbered their own master, and the four remaining lanes were on course to pay it a fourth, fifth,
sixth and seventh time. A correct procedure with a false explanation -- RULES.md names the class.

⛔⛔ A RENUMBER IS NOT A ONE-FILE EDIT, AND THE HAND VERSION HAS ALREADY PROVEN IT. MEASURED, not
inferred (hq_T 2026-09-13): ALL.in -- the stdin sidecar -- banners its blocks from the SAME e.seq the
master's banners carry. read_stdin_sidecar() attaches BY NAME, so a stale .in banner never breaks a
grade; it breaks the READER. Before corpus a401e1e3e, all 33 of the snobol4 master's ALL.in banners
AGREED with its master banners (measured at a401e1e3e^: 33 banners, 0 disagreeing). That commit renumbered
ALL.sno and ALL.ref only, so today all 33 DISAGREE -- a hand renumber that fixed one invariant silently
introduced the inconsistency across two files that the harness's own write_suite() comment exists to warn
about ("read_stdin_sidecar attaches BY NAME and would still work, which is precisely why the inconsistency
could sit there unnoticed and confuse the next person to read the two files side by side"). Icon has 23
such banners waiting for the identical trap. ⭐ THE GENERAL FORM: a "cosmetic" edit is only cosmetic
against the instruments you remembered to check -- and the sidecar nobody renumbers is the one keyed by
the field nobody grades.

WHAT THIS DOES, AND WHAT IT REFUSES TO DO: it rewrites BANNER LINES ONLY, in place, positionally. It does
NOT re-serialize through write_block_suite()/write_suite() -- a writer reorders (lines then blocks) and
could legitimately move content, and a renumber that can move content is not a renumber. Every non-banner
byte is carried through untouched and PROVEN untouched. The banner itself is regenerated through the
harness's OWN make_banner()/make_banner_cfg(), never by substituting the digits, because the banner is
width-padded to BANNER_WIDTH and the dash count depends on the seq's digit length -- 316 -> 186 loses a
digit and owes a dash, and a digit-substituting sed would leave an off-width banner that the next reader
accepts and the next `--width` check does not.

THE PROOF, RUN BEFORE ANY BYTE IS WRITTEN, ALL FOUR ARMS AND ANY ONE OF THEM REFUSES rc=2:
  (1) LINE COUNTS unchanged in every file touched.
  (2) EVERY NON-BANNER LINE byte-identical, compared positionally -- not by difflib, whose n=0 alignment
      reports content lines as moved when only their neighbouring banner changed (measured: icon showed
      636 'non-banner' ref diff lines under difflib and 0 under a positional compare).
  (3) THE ENTRIES RE-READ from the rewritten text compare equal to the entries read from the original on
      every field the grader reads -- kind, name, sno_lines, ref, stdin, xfail, argv, mask, want_rc,
      xfail_reason -- and in the same order, so no entry has moved and no name has moved.
  (4) THE RESULT SATISFIES THE INVARIANT: every banner's number equals its entry's position, in the
      master AND in ALL.in, which is the whole point and is checked rather than assumed.
