# ⛔⭐⭐ WHAT IT PINS AND WHY A NAME IS WORTH A GATE. roast_bucket() is the ONE authority that says WHY a roast
# file did not grade, and it has now been wrong about that three times in one function: `rc -ge 124` filed
# every SIGSEGV under a bucket named for the CLOCK; the missing lex arm filed 61 front-end failures as UNGRADED-OTHER; and the complement of UNGRADED-PARSE was read as "files that
# parse" and published as 143 when the direct measurement was 66.
# ⭐ THE ONE SENTENCE BEHIND ALL THREE (the cto's ruling, 2026-09-16): A BUCKET NAMED FOR A STAGE NAMES WHAT
# IT CAN RECOGNISE, NOT WHAT THE PROGRAM REACHED. Every failure of this function is a class it had no name
# for landing in a bucket named for a stage the file never got to -- and none of them shows up as a wrong
# TOTAL, which is why no board ever went red over any of the three. A miscount is loud; a misdescription is
# silent and sends the next reader looking for a defect in the wrong stage.
# ⛔ SO THE ARMS BELOW GRADE NAMES, NOT COUNTS, and they grade them on SYNTHETIC stderr built to order --
# never on the roast tree, whose answer changes every time the compiler improves.

# ⛔⭐ AND A CORRECTION MADE BY ABLATING RATHER THAN BY REASONING: this comment first claimed the ARM ORDER
# (parse tested before lex) was load-bearing. Swapping the two arms left every arm here green, because the
# driver never puts both phrases on one line -- the order is arbitrary and the claim was false. What IS
# load-bearing is that both arms read head -1 and not the whole stderr: a lex death's SECOND line is a bare
# `parse error in <file>`, so a whole-stderr parse grep swallows all 61 lex files back into UNGRADED-PARSE
# and hands the ranker files whose dying line is not a construct it can ablate. Ablating that arm reds the
# first arm below, which is how this was found. ⭐ A comment asserting that something matters is a claim like
# any other, and the way to check it is to break the thing and watch.
