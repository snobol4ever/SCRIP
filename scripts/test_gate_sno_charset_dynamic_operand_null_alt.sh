# ALTERNATION BRANCH sits immediately before it in the pattern. It does not fail -- it silently matches the

# charset-primitive-loses-its-set-after-a-null-alternation-branch (minted by hq_T, 2026-09-06T01:13:33Z),
# owned by hq_U's lane.
#
# ⭐ MECHANISM (hq_U, decisive same-binary/same-pattern/subject-only-varies experiment): bb_match_span's
# `_.op_zres` arm reads the set through ZOPQ(0,8)/ZOPD(0,4), which fall back to a raw RSP-relative spelling
# with ONE emit-time-constant displacement whenever the operand did not earn an RBP frame slot. A null-
# matching alternation arm lowers to IR_MATCH_DEFER, whose success path gamma-SUSPENDs by pushing a two-word
# resume frame and jumping to the merge WITHOUT restoring rsp -- so the null arm and a non-null arm (e.g. a
# literal match) reach the shared merge point 16 bytes apart in rsp, and one compile-time constant cannot be
# correct for both. Two blockers in series keep the operand from earning a slot in the first place:
# xop_frame_member chases gamma from operand to consumer and steps OVER the alternation's DEFER arm rather
# than into it (the hazard is invisible, not the consumer); and blob_frame_scope() is 0 for every inline
# statement graph because `flat_jmp_entry` is set only for HOISTED pattern/proc graphs -- an EMISSION-PATH
# boundary, not the `flat_pat`/"PAT$"-name test an earlier reading of this same row assumed and later
# retracted (do not cite "switched off by name" as current; it is a corrected, superseded claim). This is the
# same shared-engine class as POS/RPOS/FENCE/LEN (test_gate_sno_pos_rpos_dynamic_operand.sh); this gate's four
# witnesses are a further symptom pair (wrong-answer and crash faces both) of the identical two-blocker cause.
#
# ⛔ THIS GATE IS WITNESS-ONLY (seat11, rung 1, per this row's own GOAL text: "never a compiler fix"): it
# PROVES the class, it does not cure it. The recommended cure (a match-frame RBP slot for a dynamic pattern-
# primitive operand, precedented by capture_frame_slot, emit.cpp:2513) is hq_U's shared-engine lane with hq_S
# co-signing the SNOBOL4 board, not a fleet seat's. RED here is this gate doing its job until that cure lands
# -- once it does, this becomes the standing regression gate, unmodified.
#
# ⛔ THE SWEEP IS NOT OPTIONAL, same reasoning as the POS/RPOS/LEN gates (hq_S FINDING sec 2): argv length
# shifts the initial stack, which shifts every RSP-relative address. This class's own finding text describes
# it as deterministic (3/3, 20/20-style readings) but that was never measured across a basename-length sweep
# -- so this gate sweeps 1..20 anyway, in both modes, and reports the true ok3/ok4 count rather than assuming
# it will read 0/20 or 20/20. Determinism is a property of a witness, not of the class.
#
# CONTROLS (span_dyn_lit_nullalt, span_dyn_noalt, span_dyn_altnonull) discriminate this class from a plain
# alternation/charset semantics bug: a foldable (literal) operand, no preceding alternation at all, and an
# alternation with NO null branch are all correct today under the identical sweep and MUST stay correct, or
# this gate cannot tell "the known class" from "a new regression" apart. span_dyn_altnonull in particular is
# built the way the finding's own Corrections section insists on: its subject ('+12x') actually enters the
# non-null branch and SPAN matches a real, non-empty run ('+12') -- a subject that cannot enter the group at
# all would pass on both sides for the wrong reason and prove nothing (the finding's own caught mistake).
#
# rc=0 CLEAN (nothing swept diverges from the oracle, in either mode), rc=1 VIOLATION (at least one does),
# rc=2 UNPROVEN (no oracle, no fresh binary, or a zero denominator -- never printed as a pass).
