# util_package_inventory_cause.sh — WHY does this package's board cell carry no runner-written
# PACKAGE_INVENTORY clause? Prints exactly one CAUSE line for one package, and never guesses.
#
# Row package-shipped-per-lane-printed-by-the-runner-not-transcribed (hq_T).
#
# ⛔⭐ WHY THIS EXISTS. util_score_row.py's work line can observe only an ABSENCE -- it reads the cell and
# nothing else -- so on 2026-09-10 it named ONE cause ("the runner is not retrofitted"), was measured wrong
# for both packages it reported that day, and was cured to name TWO. On 2026-09-11 the same line was wrong
# again, in the same direction, for FOUR of the seven packages it reports: snobol4's gimpel, aisnobol,
# dotnet and testpgms are ALL wired AND their sidecars validate (ARM 20 pins all four), so NEITHER named
# cause holds -- their cells are prose only because no suite pass has rewritten them since the carriage
# landed, and under ONE RUNNER ONE BOARD (CEO-523) only the coo may run one.
# ⭐⭐ THE GENERAL FORM, and it is the reusable half: A DIAGNOSTIC THAT CAN ONLY OBSERVE AN ABSENCE MUST
# ENUMERATE EVERY CAUSE OF THE ABSENCE, AND ENUMERATING FROM MEMORY IS HOW YOU GET TWO OF FOUR. Each
# enumeration was written by someone who had just measured the cause in front of them and then generalised.
# The cure is not a longer list -- it is to stop enumerating and MEASURE the cause, which is cheap here
# (a directory, a grep, one call to the shared body) and was cheap on both earlier days too.
# ⛔ A wrong cause is not a cosmetic defect: it is a WORK LIST. This row's own baton told its next reader to
# do "the CARRIAGE half" on four runners whose carriage has been correct and pushed for days.
#
# Usage: bash scripts/util_package_inventory_cause.sh <lang> <label> <clause-regex>
#   e.g. bash scripts/util_package_inventory_cause.sh snobol4 testpgms 'spitbol_testpgms|testpgms'
# Prints one line: `CAUSE=<A|B|C|D> <label>: <text>`. rc=0 a cause was determined · rc=2 CANNOT MEASURE.

# ⭐ THE MATCH IS THE CELL'S OWN REGEX, UNANCHORED AND CASE-INSENSITIVE, exactly as util_score_row.py joins
# a clause key to a table label (`re.search(rx, k, re.I)`, util_score_row.py:2556) -- never a second
# spelling of the join. Three labels already differ from their package directory (testpgms/spitbol_testpgms,
# snoflake/snoflake_suite, gnu/gnu_prolog), and a reader that re-invented the join would report a package as
# MISSING, which looks exactly like honest work.
# ⛔ MEASURED, IN THIS SCRIPT, BEFORE IT SHIPPED: the first version matched case-SENSITIVELY and reported
# pascal/PAT as "NO VENDORED PACKAGE CORPUS" while packages/pascal/pat sat right there -- because `\bPAT\b`
# is written for a cell whose text says PAT and a directory that spells itself pat. ⭐ A JOIN COPIED FROM
# ONE PAIR OF THINGS TO ANOTHER KEEPS THE SPELLING AND LOSES THE RULE; the rule lived one line away in the
# reader this script exists to serve, and the copy was made by reading the regex rather than its consumer.

# ⛔⭐⭐ THE ARITHMETIC REFUSAL IS NOT CLEAN HERE, AND IMPORTING ARM 20'S EXEMPTION IS THE ONE MEASURED BUG

# declares the bucket sum out of scope and is RIGHT to: it grades whether a package's data is HONEST, and
# the sum needs a graded count only a suite pass produces. THIS reader answers a different question -- WILL A
# PASS PRODUCE A CLAUSE -- and for that question the arithmetic is decisive. gimpel declares ungradable=174
# against shipped=292, so a pass emits a clause only if it grades exactly 118; the coo's pass graded 132, the
# buckets did not sum, and no clause could be computed. CAUSE=D told the only seat who may run a board that
# one pass would fix a cell that every future pass refuses identically.

# roots carrying the donor's JOB rather than only its paths, one instrument down.
