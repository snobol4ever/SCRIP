# test_gate_suite_conversion_complete.sh <lang> -- ONE DONE-WHEN authority for the six tests-consolidate-* rows.
#
# ⭐ WHY THIS EXISTS (hq_C ruling 2026-08-27, on seat02's question, corroborated by seat14's measurement).
# The fan-out rows shipped with two independent defects in their DONE-WHENs, and each is trap #1 -- a criterion
# that can never say YES:
#   (1) FOUR of the six (pascal/prolog/rebus/snocone) test `find tests/<lang> -name '*.<ext>' | wc -l -eq 0`.
#       But the SETTLED architecture puts converted suite output INSIDE tests/<lang>/ WITH THE REAL EXTENSION --
#       live proof: corpus/tests/snobol4/crosscheck/patterns.sno, 44KB, pushed. So a successful conversion makes
#       that count go UP, and the criterion is unsatisfiable BY DOING THE WORK CORRECTLY. Measured at ruling
#       time: `find tests/snobol4 -name '*.sno'` = 187, against a criterion demanding 0.
#   (2) The one row that DID exclude the suite subdir hardcoded a keeper allowance (`-le 12`). seat14 then
#       measured the real number: 34 -- all of beauty_suite is STANDALONE-KEEP. A guessed keeper count is a
#       second unsatisfiable criterion wearing a fix's clothing; the keeper set is DISCOVERED by doing the work,
#       so it cannot be a constant known when the row is minted.
#
# THE CRITERION THIS IMPLEMENTS, which needs no guess: every loose program file is EITHER converted (gone from
# the loose tree) OR explicitly declared a keeper in a KEEP.md. Same three-bucket shape as the corpus coverage
# manifest -- converted / declared-kept / nothing-falls-through -- and it is the declaration, not a number, that
# carries the judgment. Do NOT "fix" a red by raising an allowance; declare the file and say why.
#
# ⭐⭐ THE FOURTH BUCKET: DEFERRED-TO-ANOTHER-ROW (PENDING.md) -- hq_B 2026-08-29, on hq_P's catch.
# A ROW-scoped split against a TREE-scoped gate cannot ever go green. tests-consolidate-prolog was split and its
# genuinely-blocked third carved out into tests-consolidate-prolog-pz4-blocked-33; those files are STILL PHYSICALLY
# IN THE TREE, so this gate counts them and the parent's DONE-WHEN is unreachable no matter how much of the
# parent's OWN work is finished. The split bought an honest FREE parent with workable items, not a reachable gate.
# ⛔ KEEP.md IS THE WRONG INSTRUMENT FOR THEM AND USING IT WOULD BE A LIE (hq_P's point, and it is the crux):
# these files are PENDING, not keepers. A keeper declaration says "this stays loose forever, on purpose"; these
# are "this converts later, when a named row unblocks". Filing the second as the first is how a deferral becomes
# permanent silently -- an allowance wearing a declaration's clothes, which is the exact defect above.
# ⛔ SO THE DEFERRAL MUST EXPIRE BY ITSELF, and that is the whole design: a PENDING.md names the OWNING ROW, and
# this gate RESOLVES that row against the live queue every run. Row missing => FAIL (dangling). Row already DONE
# => FAIL (the deferral outlived its reason; convert them now). Only a LIVE row defers. Modelled directly on
# s4e_msg.sh's BLOCKED-ON:/PARKED-AWAITING: self-clearing and its dangling-blocker refusal (2eaca909) -- a block
# recorded against a row that no longer exists is not a block, it is a hiding place.
# ⛔ AND A DEFERRED FILE NEVER READS AS CONVERTED. The verdict line says the tree is NOT fully consolidated and
# names the blocking row(s); this gate certifies THIS ROW'S SCOPE, never the tree's completeness. If the queue
# cannot be read at all, deferrals cannot be verified and the gate REFUSES rc=2 rather than trusting them.
#
# REFUSES rc=2 when it cannot measure -- never skip-as-success.

# ⛔⭐⭐ A PENDING.md DECLARES ONLY WHAT IS LISTED UNDER `## DEFERRED`, AND PROSE ANYWHERE ELSE IS INERT.
# MEASURED THE HARD WAY (hq_B 2026-08-29, on the first real PENDING.md ever written -- my own): I listed all
# 49 loose files in it, 32 deferred plus 17 I was explicitly NOT deferring and was describing in order to
# explain the split. The gate deferred ALL 49 AND WENT GREEN (rc=0). A false green, authored by the person
# who had just written the bucket, in the first hour it existed.
# ⭐ THIS IS KEEP.md's PROSE-MENTION SURFACE, WHICH hq_P CURED ONE LEVEL AND DELIBERATELY LEFT OPEN AT THIS
# ONE -- "prose mention WITHIN the owning directory still counts as a declaration; that surface is left,
# because narrowing it further needs a format change and would break every existing KEEP.md". That reasoning
# is right for KEEP.md and WRONG for PENDING.md, for a reason specific to what each file is for: a KEEP.md
# lists things it keeps, while a PENDING.md inherently wants to DISCUSS the files it is not deferring -- to
# say which are convertible now and why the rest are not. Its most natural content is the exact content that
# breaks it. The surface is not merely open here, it is aimed at the writer.
# ⛔ SO PENDING.md IS STRUCTURED, NOT PROSE. Only `- `/`* ` list items under a `## DEFERRED` heading (up to
# the next `## `) declare anything. There is no migration cost: this format is one session old and has
# exactly one instance in the tree. A NEW format is the one moment when strictness is free -- KEEP.md's
# surface stayed open only because it had already been paid for.
# ⭐ A `## DEFERRED` HEADING MAY NAME ITS OWN ROW: `## DEFERRED <row-topic>`. Bare `## DEFERRED` falls back to
# the file-level `ROW:`. MEASURED NEED (hq_B 2026-08-29, within a day of writing the one-row rule): the 12
# wrong-output prolog files route to THREE different rows -- 11 to the generator-resume-cell row (ASM-confirmed
# by seat03 for 5, by the same discriminator here for 6 more) and 1 to prolog-existence-error-not-catchable-iso,
# which shares neither symbol. The original "one row per PENDING.md" rule was justified as "a file that needs
# two owners has not been split yet" -- true of ONE FILE, and it silently also forbade DIFFERENT FILES having
# different owners, which is the ordinary case. Per-section rows cost one awk field and remove the incentive to
# mis-route a file just to keep the declaration expressible.
# Emits `row<TAB>list-item-text` for every item under any DEFERRED heading; row empty => use the file-level ROW:.

# ⭐⭐ config/*KEEP.md ALSO DECLARES (seat07 2026-08-30, on the zero-subfolders end state going live for

# (hq_C's MODES.tsv ruling names it explicitly), and SNOBOL4's own tree already carries a dozen
# `<prefix>_KEEP.md` files there -- but this gate only ever looked for a literal per-ancestor-directory
# `KEEP.md`, so config/ was invisible to it (MEASURED: `test_gate_suite_conversion_complete.sh snobol4`
# itself reports 95 undeclared today, entirely because its own config/*_KEEP.md files are never read).
# config/ is a FLAT junk-drawer, not a per-family ancestor directory the old walk's directory-scoping
# logic was built for, so every *KEEP.md under it applies tree-wide -- the SAME delimited/unambiguous
# match rule as an ordinary KEEP.md, just checked against every such file rather than one per directory
# level.

# ⛔⭐⭐ THE DECLARATION CHECK WAS A RAW SUBSTRING TEST OVER EVERY KEEP.md CONCATENATED, AND IT UNDER-COUNTED
# (seat14 2026-08-29, measured; cured here by hq_P). The old form was:
#     DECLARED=$(cat "${KEEPFILES[@]}"); case "$DECLARED" in *"$b"*) : ;; ... esac
# — two independent defects on one line, BOTH of which make the gate report FEWER undeclared files than exist,
# i.e. they push it toward FALSE GREEN:
#   (1) SCOPE WAS DESTROYED. Every KEEP.md in the tree was concatenated, so a KEEP.md in one subdirectory
#       silently declared same-named files anywhere else. MEASURED: writing tests/prolog/KEEP.md to rule on
#       ONE file (plunit.pl) dropped loose-but-undeclared by THREE — frontend/plunit.pl was declared by
#       accident purely through a basename collision.
#   (2) THE MATCH WAS AN UNDELIMITED SUBSTRING, so `foo.pl` matches inside `myfoo.pl`, and any KEEP.md that
#       merely MENTIONS another file's name — to contrast it, exclude it, or cross-reference it, which is a
#       normal and good thing to write in prose — silently declared that file too.
# ⭐ THE CURE KEEPS THE PROSE FORMAT (every real KEEP.md is prose with backticked names; a structured-list
# requirement would invalidate all of them). Instead: a KEEP.md may only declare files in ITS OWN DIRECTORY
# or below it, and the basename must appear DELIMITED — bounded by a non-filename character on each side.
# ⛔ Prose mention WITHIN the owning directory still counts as a declaration; that surface is deliberately
# left, because narrowing it further needs a format change and would break every existing KEEP.md. The
# declaring file is now PRINTED for each kept file, so an accidental declaration is visible instead of silent.
# ⭐ AMBIGUITY IS THE ACTUAL TEST, not path depth. Two rules were tried and BOTH were wrong:
#   bare basename anywhere in any KEEP.md  -> seat14's measured false positive (a root KEEP.md naming
#                                             `plunit.pl` silently declared frontend/plunit.pl too);
#   path relative to the KEEP.md, always   -> a FALSE RED on 66 real files: tests/snocone/ladder/KEEP.md
#                                             legitimately declares ladder/prog/*.sc by bare basename, and
#                                             there is nothing ambiguous about it.
# ⛔ What made seat14's case wrong was not the bare name, it was that the bare name was AMBIGUOUS — two loose
# files shared it and only one was meant. So: a bare basename declares a file only when that basename is
# UNIQUE among the loose files; when two or more share it, the declaration must be written as the path
# relative to the KEEP.md. Unambiguous trees keep working untouched; ambiguous ones must say which they mean.
# ⛔⭐⭐ A DEFERRAL RECORDS INTENT, NOT REACHABILITY (hq_B 2026-08-29, on hq_P + seat05's finding).
# A file can be correctly deferred -- named, reasoned, pointed at a LIVE row -- and simultaneously run by
# NOTHING. The two facts are independent and this gate reported only the first, which made the state read as
# under control. MEASURED WITNESS: tests/prolog/rung31_bridge_catch/{04,05}_*.pl and
# rung38_iso_errors/03_existence_error.pl are all correctly deferred here, and their family runners were
# repointed at the consolidated suite -- which contains ZERO `throw(` and ZERO `existence_error` -- so nothing
# executes them. The board stays green because nothing fails, and nothing fails because nothing runs.
# ⛔ REFERENCING THE FAMILY IS NOT REACHING THE FILE. A consolidated runner names its family and points at
# <family>.pl only; matching the family name would call every orphaned directory file "reachable" and the
# check would certify exactly the state it exists to catch. Match the PATH or the BASENAME, or a runner that
# globs the file's OWN directory -- nothing weaker.
# ⛔ AND A GATE THAT MERELY LISTS A FILE IS NOT A RUNNER: this script and the declaration files are excluded,
# or the census would count its own reading of a name as evidence that something executes it.
# ⭐ SCOPE, stated because the general problem is bigger than what this can check (hq_P's sweep): of 140
# consolidated suites only FIVE still have a directory. Where the loose files are GONE, "is anything running
# this file" has to become "is anything running what this file COVERED" -- a construct check, not a path
# check. This gate answers the path question for files that still exist, which is exactly the population a
# PENDING.md declares. It does NOT answer the construct question, and must not be read as though it does.

    # sweeps, which is GREEN and is the manifest's own GATED harness for tests/prolog. That runner names only
    # the TREE ROOT ("$S4E/corpus/tests/prolog") and reaches every subdirectory via `find`. Nothing in the
    # file's own basename, relative path, or own directory appears in any script, so all three greps missed.
    # ⭐ THE GATE WAS RIGHT ABOUT THE POPULATION AND WRONG ABOUT THE MEMBER, WHICH IS THE EXPENSIVE DIRECTION:
    # a false DARK fails a row's DONE-WHEN on a file that is genuinely executed, so the row can never close
    # and the message tells its owner to go fix something that is not broken.
    # ⛔ AND `find` CO-OCCURRENCE IS REQUIRED, not just the ancestor name. A script naming an ancestor and
    # then globbing `"$DIR"/*.pl` at ONE level does NOT reach a subdirectory, and clearing on the name alone
    # would trade a false DARK for a false CLEAR -- the dangerous direction, since a file wrongly declared
    # reachable is exactly the untested-but-managed state this whole check exists to expose.
    # ⚠️ HONEST LIMIT, stated because the next reader will otherwise assume more: this is still TEXTUAL. It
    # proves a script names an ancestor and does recursive discovery somewhere in its body; it does not prove
    # that particular `find` is rooted at that particular ancestor, nor that its -name filter matches this
    # file. Reachability is only truly answerable by asking the runners what they ran. This narrows a
