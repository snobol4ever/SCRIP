"""util_arena_pin_census.py -- THE CENSUS OF RECORD for the CEO-1146 arena sweep: which gates PIN the arena,
BY NAME, in what FORM, and whether the pin is reachable from the blocking set.

CEO-1153 (2026-09-22, ruling the coo/ceo overlap option 1): "the arena sweep stays yours under CEO-1146 and its
population is your pinned census BY NAME ... my line-stripped grep reads 27 gates with a literal or brace-default
MB=1, 26 of them in the blocking set; yours is the census of record, the difference is comment stripping."

⛔ WHY THIS IS AN INSTRUMENT AND NOT A grep, stated where the number is.  Two seats greppting the same tree got 27
and 28.  A sweep whose POPULATION is in dispute cannot produce a receipt anyone can check, and "the difference is
comment stripping" is a hypothesis until something prints both halves.  So this census prints, for every gate:
the form, the line, and whether that line SURVIVES comment stripping -- and it prints the DISAGREEING set by name
rather than reconciling the totals silently.  A total that agrees by accident is not agreement.

⛔ THE STRIPPING RULE IS STATED, NOT ASSUMED.  Shell has no tokenizer here, so `#` is treated as starting a comment
only at the start of a line or after whitespace, and NEVER inside single or double quotes on that line.  That rule
is WRONG inside heredocs (a `#` there is data, not a comment) so every heredoc-interior line is reported as
AMBIGUOUS and counted in NEITHER half -- an instrument that guesses on the exact population under dispute is the
defect this row exists to close.

⛔ THE OTHER KNOB IS PART OF THE FORM (the cto, measured 2026-09-22; re-derived at gc_heap.c:191-192 by the coo).
:191 reads SCRIP_HEAP_MB and sets BOTH mb and kb; :192 reads SCRIP_HEAP_KB and OVERWRITES kb.  Last writer wins and
KB is last, so an exported SCRIP_HEAP_KB silently defeats an explicit MB pin -- measured: collector_visits arm 5
read gc2 0 of 5 under an outer KB=64 while passing at its own default.  A pin that does not unset the other knob is
therefore NOT A PIN, and this census grades that per gate (PIN-UNSAFE) instead of treating every pin as equal.
CEO-1153 makes `env -u` a condition of the sweep; two-knobs-set-refuses-rc2 is the ceo's 33rd batch.

# ⛔⭐ ALL FOUR POSIX DEFAULT OPERATORS, AND THE NARROW VERSION OF THIS LINE COST THE CENSUS ITS OWN POPULATION.
# It read `=1` and `${VAR:-1}` and NOT `${VAR:=1}` -- one character apart, the assign-if-unset twin of the form it
# already knew -- so it called two genuinely pinned gates unpinned and reported 16 where the truth is 18
# (nv_cell_caches_honour_the_memo_generation L38, the_pending_prolog_ball_is_a_rooted_cell L48, both spelling it
# `: "${SCRIP_HEAP_MB:=1}"; export SCRIP_HEAP_MB`).  ⛔ THE COUNT WAS THE SMALL HALF: a DONE-WHEN was about to be
# written that trusts THIS READER to say ZERO, so a spelling it cannot see is a FALSE GREEN minted by the very
# instrument the sweep is graded on -- the census preaching "an instrument that guesses on the exact population
# under dispute is the defect this row exists to close" while doing it.  Caught by diffing against a hand grep and
# reading the DISAGREEING SET rather than the totals, which is what the docstring above says to do.
# So the form list is now DERIVED FROM THE SHELL GRAMMAR rather than from the spellings that happened to be in the
# tree: `=` (assignment), `:=` (assign if unset or null), `:-` (substitute if unset or null), `-` (substitute if
# unset).  A form nobody uses today costs nothing and every match is PRINTED BY NAME AND LINE, so a false positive
# is visible to the reader rather than buried in a total -- and --selftest plants one witness per spelling so this
# line can never again be narrower than the grammar without an arm going red.
# ⛔⭐ SPLIT OUT AND NAMED, NEVER FORCED (MODE line 2's standing warning; CEO-1146's population is a sweep, not a
# mandate).  A gate lands here ONLY with a reason printed beside it, so the arithmetic stays checkable by a reader:
# the swept remainder is pinned MINUS the cto's MINUS these, each one readable.  A silent exemption would be the
# census lying about its own population, which is the defect this file exists to stop.

        "(1, 4, 512 MB) and requiring three different readings -- a compile-time constant reports 512 three times and "
        "cannot pass. Converting those to KB would delete the gate's subject. It already states this sweep's own "
