# test_gate_gc_the_visited_set_key_spaces_do_not_collide.sh -- THE COLLECTOR'S VISITED SET HOLDS THREE KINDS OF KEY IN ONE
# TABLE, AND A KEY OF ONE KIND MUST NEVER ANSWER A QUESTION OF ANOTHER (cto 2026-09-23, CTO-153; law RULES.md FACT RULE THE
# COLLECTOR GUESSES NOTHING, CEO-812).
#
# MEASURED 2026-09-23 on procedure_every_scan_replace_9 (the Icon rungs), the ONE entry the holder-(A) landing bda7691cc
# turned non-green (CRASH at SCRIP_GC_STRESS=1/3/5 under SCRIP_GC_RELOC=1 in both modes, [ZGC-STALE] "THE FAULT HAPPENED
# INSIDE A COLLECTION"): the crash was gc_visit_tbblk reading a table whose buckets pointer had not been repaired for
# three collections while the table itself moved every time.  The gdb probes (slot2..slot8.py: a watchpoint on the frame
# slot, then on the table's buckets word, then every gc_hins call for the table's address with its caller line and return
# value) read the mechanism: a DT_N slen=1 cell reference whose ptr was the table's first word inserted the TABLE'S OWN
# ADDRESS into the visited set from gc_visit_one's name-cell case (gc_heap.c:823, key = the cell address), every later
# DT_T visit of the table then read gc_hins(t)=0 "already visited" and skipped gc_visit_tbblk, the buckets array was never
# marked, was reclaimed, and the collection after next walked an integer cell as a bucket.  Ordinary compaction had left
# the table and its buckets in place, so the assignment seam's removal only changed WHEN the collision started to matter.
#
# THE CURE: distinct key spaces by construction -- bit 0 was a registered slot (RETIRED 2026-10-01 by the cfo: the slot record carries its target offset and the fixup is idempotent), bit 1 = a name-
# referenced cell (the DT_N slen=1 case), an even key = an aggregate whose contents were visited.  The plant
# The key-collision PLANT (SCRIP_GC_PLANT_KEY_COLLISION, which restored the shared key so the crash could be seen to return) was RETIRED 2026-09-26 (cto, row gc-the-key-collision-plant-has-no-witness-today): no producer of a slen-1 name cell into a block whose key is that cell exists on the tree, so arm (b) now grades the one producer of the shape that does exist, a record field used as a name, and FAIL_ONCE grades arm (a) against an empty ref.
#
# ARMS: (a) THE PROPERTY: the witness (the rungs entry, ref cut from iconx) answers its ref at SCRIP_GC_STRESS=1,3,5 under
# SCRIP_GC_RELOC=1 at the compiled default arena in mode 3 and mode 4; (b) the plant reproduces the loss (rc!=0 or DIFF) at
# stress 1 -- an instrument never seen to fire is not known to look; (c) the source carries the distinct key.
# FAIL_ONCE=1 runs arm (a) under the plant and requires it to red.
