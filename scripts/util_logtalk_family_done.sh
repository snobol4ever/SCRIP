# util_logtalk_family_done.sh -- the DONE-WHEN body of one Logtalk FAMILY row (ceo CEO-650): grades each named group
# with util_logtalk_grade.py --group (a development aid, never a board -- the coo's test_prolog_logtalk_suite.sh is the
# board) in BOTH modes and is green only when every group's cases ALL PASS IN BOTH MODES over a non-zero population.
#
# ⛔⭐ THE VERDICT IS both-modes-pass == population, NOT FAIL=0, AND THE DIFFERENCE IS A FALSE GREEN THAT
# FIRED (hq_C, 2026-09-13). FAIL is not the only way to not pass: the runner's own doctrine is that a case
# it cannot set up is UNGRADED, named with its reason, "never dropped from the population and never counted
# as passing" -- but a FAIL=0 verdict counts it as passing anyway. Measured that day: a harness change
# turned the 15 cases blocked on stream aliases from FAIL into UNGRADED, and this script immediately
# reported `escape_sequences PASS cases=12 both-modes=8` -- a green group with a THIRD of its cases
# unmeasured, printed on the same line as the 8 that were. ⭐ Nothing about the change was wrong: the
# reclassification was correct and made the board MORE honest. The defect was that this verdict read one of
# the six buckets and treated the other five as empty, so becoming more honest upstream read as becoming
# greener here -- a criterion that improves when the work becomes less measurable can never close its row.
#
# ⛔⭐ ROUTED CASES: SCOPED MEANS ROUTED, NEVER SUBTRACTED (cto ruling to hq_C, 2026-09-13). A family row whose
# group contains cases that only ANOTHER seat's lane can cure narrows its verdict by DECLARING them in
# scripts/lib_logtalk_routed.tsv with the row that now owns each one. This gate prints every routed case BY
# NAME with its owning row on every run -- a case dropped silently and a case never measured produce the same
# output, and only naming separates them. ⭐ The declaration expires by itself: a routed case that PASSES, or
# that is not in the group's population at all, REFUSES(2) instead of passing, because a tolerated-red list is
# written when the red is found and read long after it is closed, and so goes stale in the flattering
# direction. The day the owning row lands, the routed cases come back into this row's denominator.
# Usage: bash scripts/util_logtalk_family_done.sh <group> [<group>...]
# rc 0 green AND the row may be declared done · 1 red · 2 could not measure, OR every case passes and the DONE
# CLAIM IS REFUSED because a group's population could not have produced the counter-example (see the cross-index
# block below) -- rc 2 is never a pass, so a caller that tests `rc = 0` is already correct without knowing which.
