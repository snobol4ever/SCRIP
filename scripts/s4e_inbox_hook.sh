# s4e_inbox_hook.sh -- ⭐ THE LOOP STEP 1, HARDENED INTO THE HARNESS (hq_C s261, Lon: "But what the loop says
# never happens.  Has this been hardened or do we ask God when you pray?").
#
# ⛔ WHAT WAS BROKEN, AND IT WAS BROKEN FOR EVERY SEAT SIMULTANEOUSLY.  PROTOCOL.md and every CLAUDE.md say
# "At EVERY prompt, before anything else: s4e_msg.sh check".  MEASURED s261: BOTH HQs ran check exactly ONCE,
# at session start, read ten messages each, replied to none, cleared neither, and did not look again for the
# rest of the session.  Four more messages arrived unseen -- including one asking for a receipt, which was the
# very thing Lon was testing.  Lon had to ask "Are you answering your messages?" to discover it.  Two seats,
# no coordination, identical failure: that is not a lapse, it is a MISSING ENFORCEMENT.
#
# ⭐ THE PRECEDENT THAT PROVES THE CURE.  The BANNER law had this exact shape -- "MANDATORY LAST ACT OF EVERY
# SESSION", an instruction no session can follow because a session cannot know which reply is its last.  Lon
# measured the result ("none of the sessions ... NEVER show the required banner") and the fix was NOT a
# sterner rule, it was a `Stop` hook.  Since s255 the banner fires whether the seat finishes, blocks, or is
# cancelled.  THE INBOX LAW HAS THE SAME DEFECT AND NEVER GOT THE SAME FIX.  This is that fix: a
# UserPromptSubmit hook, so the inbox state is in front of the seat at every prompt mechanically.
#
# ⛔ WHY HEADERS AND NOT BODIES.  Dumping 11 dense messages into context at every prompt costs ~10k tokens a
# turn and would itself become the thing a seat learns to skim past.  The hook prints the COUNT and the
# FROM/RE line of each, which is a signal that cannot be misread, and names the command for the bodies.  HQ
# context is the scarcest resource; a reminder that bankrupts it is not a reminder.
#
# ⭐ SEAT-DERIVED, NOT HARDCODED -- the same D-17 PORTABLE-HOME derivation s4e_msg.sh uses, so hq_P, ceo and
# every seat wire the IDENTICAL hook with no per-seat edit.  A hook that hardcodes /home/claude_C would grade
# another seat against this inbox, which is exactly the layer-2 false-GREEN hq_P found in the batons.

# brief offered `make setup` OR the session path; `make setup` runs $ROOT/setup.sh, which DOES
# NOT EXIST in this tree, so it would have installed nothing forever -- the same
# looks-wired-cannot-fire defect this fleet has now measured four times today. This is the live
# path: it runs for every seat at every prompt, costs a cmp per repo, and says nothing unless it
# actually installed something. Never allowed to break the inbox banner above it.
