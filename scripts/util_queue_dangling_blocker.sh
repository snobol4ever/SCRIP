# util_queue_dangling_blocker.sh -- row `picker-dangling-blocker-parks-a-row-forever-in-silence` (hq_B mint 2026-08-29), cure (2).
#
# ⛔⭐ THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS FOR: a row's state column can read BLOCKED-ON:<name>/PARKED-AWAITING:<name> where <name> is
# not a real row at all -- a sub-item gloss appended to a real topic ("icon-n2-generator-activation-frames-items-3-4",
# meaning "items 3-4 of icon-n2-generator-activation-frames"), a typo, or a topic that was renamed/retired. The two
# mechanisms that would ever free such a row both key on the blocker NAME: the promotion walk's dangling branch
# ("no row exists to serve") and the self-heal check (s4e_blocker_done, which needs a claim/QUEUE.done.tsv hit for
# that exact name) both just silently return false forever. MEASURED (hq_B, queue-wide sweep, 2026-08-29):
# prolog-pz4-gamma-retain-activation-frames named exactly this shape; 3 more rows sat parked behind pz4, all
# unresolvable until a human happened to notice. `s4e_msg.sh park` now REFUSES (rc=2) writing a new dangling
# blocker (cure 1) -- this script is cure 2, for the ones already written before that guard existed, or written
# some other way (direct QUEUE.tsv edit).
#
# ⛔ THIS SCRIPT ONLY REPORTS. It never edits QUEUE.tsv and never touches a claim -- repairing a dangling block
# (re-point it at the real row, or park FREE if the intended blocker no longer applies) is a judgement call with
# an owner, exactly per util_queue_donewhen_state_disagree.sh's own precedent.
#
# A blocker name counts as REAL (not dangling) if it is either a live QUEUE.tsv row, or already swept into
# QUEUE.done.tsv -- the same two facts s4e_msg.sh's own qrow()/s4e_blocker_done() consult, so this script flags
# exactly what the now-fixed `park` would have refused, no more and no less.
