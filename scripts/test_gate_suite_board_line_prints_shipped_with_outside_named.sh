# test_gate_suite_board_line_prints_shipped_with_outside_named.sh -- THE HARNESS BOARD LINE PRINTS PASS OVER THE SHIPPED
# POPULATION WITH OUTSIDE NAMED, AND THE OUTSIDE ENTRIES REACH THE PROGRESS DB (coo 2026-09-16; ceo CEO-772, CEO-749; Lon
# 2026-09-16 "Get those fixed" -- OUTSIDE is debt; row snobol4-master-runner-publishes-over-the-graded-population-1972-not-
# the-shipped-1980-with-outside-named).
#
# THE DEFECT: corpus_suite_harness.py dropped every --outside entry from its SUITE_BOARD total= (1972 for a 1980-entry
# master) and recorded nothing for them, so test_corpus_snobol4.sh published 1961/1972 and the SUITES.tsv row had to be
# hand-set to 1961/1980 OUTSIDE=8 (COO-82); on one of the harness's two paths total= still carried the outside
# entries while the mode counts did not -- one word, two arithmetics. Every board write dropped OUTSIDE (hq_snobol4).
#
# THE CURE UNDER TEST: the SUITE_BOARD prints total= (graded) shipped= (graded + outside) outside= (the entries THIS run
# removed, so a sharded sum reads once), OUTSIDE_BASELINE lines name each with the oracle's class and reason, and each is
# appended to the progress DB as OUTSIDE in every requested mode; test_corpus_snobol4.sh quotes all_pass/shipped OUTSIDE=N
# and refuses when the fields are absent.
#
# ARMS (hermetic: a three-entry suite cut from the live master under mktemp in a tests/snobol4/ALL.sno layout, the progress
# DB redirected by S4E_PROGRESS_DB to a scratch table -- the live table is never touched; a fixture outside the corpus is not
# a board and the one-runner guard does not apply, CEO-547):
#   (a) with one entry declared outside: SUITE_BOARD total=2 shipped=3 outside=1, all_n=2, m3_n=2 m4_n=2
#   (b) the OUTSIDE_BASELINE line names the entry with its class and reason, and the count line says IN the shipped one
#   (c) the scratch DB carries one OUTSIDE row per requested mode for the entry, note = class: reason
#   (d) ⛔ AMENDED 2026-09-17 (coo): the same suite with NO --outside now rides the SIBLING list and still prints
#       total=2 shipped=3 outside=1, with OUTSIDE_BASELINE_LIST saying DERIVED. This arm used to assert the OPPOSITE
#       (total=3 shipped=3 outside=0), and that assertion was the defect written down: two boards on the same corpus
#       a6bcd8097 76 minutes apart disagreed on seven snobol4-master entries -- cfo 22:55:52Z PASS, cto 00:11:39Z
#       OUTSIDE -- because a direct `corpus_suite_harness.py run` omitted the flag and graded the eight entries the
#       ONE ORACLE REFUSES against their stored .ref. A declared fact beside the data may not depend on the caller
#       remembering a flag; the escape is loud, not silent, which is arm (f).
#   (e) STATIC: test_corpus_snobol4.sh writes --suite-total "$_sn4_shipped" and refuses when shipped=/outside= are absent
#       and test_icon_arizona_suite.sh / test_icon_jcon_suite.sh write --suite-total "$SHIPPED", never a graded subset (ceo CEO-1245,
#       CEO-1268: Zona 88/124 and Jcon 82/91, the ungraded staying in the denominator as debt)
#   (f) --outside-none is the LOUD escape: total=3 shipped=3 outside=0 AND the printed line names the list it skipped
#       and says the count is not comparable to a baseline board; --outside with --outside-none together REFUSE rc=2
# FAIL_ONCE=1 rewrites the captured board line's shipped=3 to shipped=2 before arm (a) grades, to prove the arm trips.
# rc 0 = every arm holds; rc 1 = a FAIL named; rc 2 = REFUSED-TO-GRADE (no binary, no master to cut the fixture from).
