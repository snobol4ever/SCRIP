# test_gate_errlimit_survival_is_measured_per_code.sh -- &ERRLIMIT SURVIVAL IS DECIDED PER ERROR CODE BY THE
# ORACLE, NOT BY MEMBERSHIP IN A LIST BUILT FOR A DIFFERENT QUESTION.  hq_U 2026-09-12, curing the coo's
# bisected master regression keyword_replace_branch_9 (SNOBOL4 master 1869/1894, FAIL=1 where the previous
# pass read FAIL=0).
#
# ⛔⭐ THE DEFECT THIS PINS, AND IT IS A CLASS, NOT A CODE.  70a0bc6c0 (hq_U) cured a real bug -- a goto to an
# undefined label was absorbed by &ERRLIMIT and the program ended silently where sbl stops -- by making the
# &ERRLIMIT arm consult core_err_is_terminal().  That list already existed and already held eleven codes, and
# it was built to answer "does this exit nonzero".  Reading it for "may this be absorbed" moved ELEVEN codes
# on one commit's evidence about ONE of them.  It was wrong for 022 the same day: sbl -bf absorbs an undefined
# function call under &ERRLIMIT and prints nothing, and we began printing ERROR 022 and exiting 1.
# ⭐ EIGHT OF THE ELEVEN ARE RAISED AT ZERO SITES IN THIS TREE, so the first consultation silently changed
# behaviour for codes for which no witness can even be minted -- the part that makes this worth a gate rather
# than a one-line revert.  A classification is safe to consult only for the question it was measured for.
#
# THE ARMS -- each witness run under `&ERRLIMIT = 10` against the ONE oracle (sbl -bf) and against SCRIP in
# BOTH modes, and SCRIP must agree with the oracle on WHETHER EXECUTION CONTINUED:
#   022 undefined function called   `X = NOSUCHFN(1) :F(NX)`   oracle ABSORBS, prints nothing, continues
#   038 goto undefined label        `:(NOSUCHLABEL)`           oracle REPORTS and stops
#   242 return from level zero      `:(RETURN)` at depth zero   oracle REPORTS and stops
# ⭐ 038 AND 242 ARE THE CONTROL ARMS AND THEY ARE NOT DECORATION: they are the two cures this gate must not
# let a future "just absorb everything" revert undo (038 is hq_U's 70a0bc6c0, 242 is hq_S's 99d4be3aa).  A
# gate holding only the 022 arm would go green on the exact regression that produced 70a0bc6c0.
#
# ⛔ THE INSTRUMENT IS THE ORACLE, RE-ASKED EVERY RUN, NEVER A PINNED STRING.  Each witness is run through sbl
# -bf in the same invocation and SCRIP is compared against THAT, so a cure moves both sides together and
# cannot invalidate the gate; and nothing here encodes "022 survives" as a fact this file believes -- it
# encodes "SCRIP answers whatever the oracle answers", which stays true if SPITBOL is ever measured again and
# disagrees with today's reading.
#
# REFUSES rc=2 (never a pass, never a fail) when it cannot measure: no oracle, stale binary, or a witness the
# oracle itself cannot run.
