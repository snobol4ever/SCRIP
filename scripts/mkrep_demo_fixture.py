# the program itself brackets the FIXTURE (the match), so the match phase is isolated from the
# pattern-COMPILE phase that dominates these demos at their committed inputs.
# ⛔ REFUSES rather than emitting a variant it cannot vouch for: exactly one fixture line, or nothing.

# calculator-2 and json write the IMPLICIT juxtaposition form `src  C  :F(error)` with no '?' at all.
# A detector keyed on '?' finds zero fixtures in the second group and, if it then fell back to a guess,
# would silently bracket the wrong statement. So: locate `<subj> = INPUT`, then take the next
# non-comment statement whose subject is that same variable and which is NOT an assignment.

# ⭐ THE BRACKET GOES TO STDERR (ceo ruling, 2026-08-28): the correctness anchor and the perf instrument
# never share a channel, so stdout stays byte-identical and every committed .ref is untouched.
# ⛔ THIS WAS A TEMP FILE UNTIL TONIGHT, and only because SCRIP silently discarded every write to an
# OUTPUT association on a file descriptor. hq_C cured that (SCRIP 69178c73) -- and the defect was WIDER
# than the fd2 symptom I routed: -f1 was silently discarded identically, because _io_parse_opts
# understood -fn perfectly and had exactly one caller, _INPUT_; the write side never called the parser.
# Verified in both modes on the cured build before this switch was made.
# ⛔ LABELLED TIME_ns, NOT cpu_ns OR elapsed_ns, DELIBERATELY: TIME() is measured to be NANOSECONDS in
# both engines (calibrated against an external clock, not taken from the manual's millisecond
# convention), but WHICH clock it is -- wall or cpu -- is NOT settled: every calibration run was
# compute-bound, so the two coincide and the test cannot separate them. Naming it for the primitive
# rather than for a quantity we have not proven keeps the claim the size of the evidence.
