# test_gate_rakugram_precedence.sh — RUNG 4 gate for the Grammar.nqp -> recursive-descent port.
#
# Regenerates Raku's operator-precedence table from Rakudo's Grammar.nqp, compiles the emitted Pratt
# parser, and proves three things about it. The third is the one that matters:
#
#   1. PRECEDENCE   2 + 3 * 4  folds as  (2 + (3 * 4))
#   2. ASSOCIATIVITY  1 - 2 - 3 -> ((1-2)-3) left, 2 ** 3 ** 2 -> (2**(3**2)) right
#      ⛔ Associativity is INVISIBLE to any syntax-only test: a parser that folds 1-2-3 as 1-(2-3)
#         accepts exactly the same language. Only a shape assertion catches it.
#   3. HLL LAYER    ws / identifier / int literals / lookahead -- the hand-written rules that cannot
#                   be generated from Grammar.nqp at all (rung 6). Asserts the SUBTLE cases: that
#                   `a - b` does not lex as the identifier `a-b`, that a leading underscore is not a
#                   number, and that lookahead does not consume. Each of those misparses plausibly
#                   and only shows up much later.
#   6. RUNG 8: :my / {code} / :dba lower as matching no-ops and `A ~ B C` is rewritten to `A C B`;
#      the gate's load-bearing half is THE GUARD -- a consultation of a parse-time variable
#      (`<?{ $*IN_DECL }>`) must STILL refuse, or the no-op declaration is a silent wrong answer.
#   5. LOWERED PRIMITIVES  character classes, backslash escapes, anchors and lookahead operands
#      are real code (rung 7). Rung 3 shipped them as stubs that answered "matched" for any input,
#      so this section asserts what each REJECTS -- the only thing a placeholder cannot fake.
#   4. PARSE-TIME EXTENSION — install a new operator at a precedence BETWEEN two existing levels
#      while parsing, and see it bind correctly. This is the property that makes Raku non-LALR and
#      the reason the bison grammar was retired (Lon 2026-08-30); a gate that did not exercise it
#      would pass just as happily against a frozen table, which is the exact defect being avoided.
#
# REFUSES rc=2 when it cannot measure (no Grammar.nqp, no compiler) rather than reporting green.
