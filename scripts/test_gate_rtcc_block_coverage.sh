# test_gate_rtcc_block_coverage.sh — RTCC DoD coverage gate (GOAL-RTCC.md, s16).
#
# WHY: s14 established the coverage census BY HAND ("3 of 17 claimed registers round-trip at HEAD").
# A hand census is re-derived every session and rots silently between them.  RC-7's DoD line 1 cannot
# be certified against a veneer whose coverage nobody can recompute in one command.  This is that command.
#
# THE INVARIANT: for every register the VM claims as a global, the veneer must
#   (a) WRITE IT BACK at generated->C crossings,
#   (b) RELOAD IT at C->generated crossings, in BOTH mediums identically, and
#   (c) leave its block slot visible to the GC.
# A register failing (a) or (b) is not a global, it is a wish.  A register failing (c) is a
# use-after-free waiting for the first claimed register that holds a heap DESCR.
#
# ⛔ s11 LAW OBSERVED: no `cmd | grep -q` under pipefail anywhere below — the reader's early exit
# SIGPIPEs the upstream and a MATCH READS AS A MISS.  Every test is `grep -c` + a count comparison.
# ⛔ s15h LAW OBSERVED: the tree is located with `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`, never a hardcoded
# /home/claude path, so this gate grades the tree it lives in and not a peer seat's worktree.
# ⛔ POSITIVE CONTROL (test_gate_omega_own_k.sh exemplar): if the encoders cannot be found at all the
# gate EXITS 1 rather than passing over nothing.
