# scripts/test_gate_no_c_to_bb_ratchet.sh — THE PER-SITE RATCHET UNDER test_gate_no_c_to_bb.sh (cfo 2026-09-20).
#
# LON, 2026-09-20 07:3x CDT, in-chat to the cfo, verbatim: "Ensure that BB's are never called from C except
# the first time at initial start."  This gate is the ENSURE.  The convention itself is stated and measured by
# test_gate_no_c_to_bb.sh; that gate finds every transfer and names it.  What it could not do is stop a NEW one.
#
# ⛔ THE SEAM THIS CLOSES, AND IT IS IN THE OTHER GATE'S OWN ARITHMETIC — READ THIS BEFORE TOUCHING EITHER FILE.
# test_gate_no_c_to_bb.sh computes its verdict as N=$(echo $VGRPS | wc -w): the number of LEDGER GROUPS still
# populated, which is 3 today (V4, V6, V7) while TWELVE transfer sites exist.  A thirteenth transfer added to an
# already-populated group therefore moves NOTHING that gate reports as its verdict -- N stays 3, the STRICT line
# reads the same, and the regression is invisible.  Only an UNLEDGERED transfer (one no ledger arm classifies)
# raises its own flag.  So the existing gate answers "are there groups left", and this one answers "did the
# population grow", which is the question "ensure" actually asks.  Neither is a substitute for the other.
#
# ⛔ AND IT IS UNWIRED, WHICH IS THE OTHER HALF.  test_gate_no_c_to_bb.sh sits in gate_wiring.tsv as TASK -- a
# row's DONE-WHEN instrument, reachable from no blocking set -- so on 2026-09-20 NOTHING in `make test` would
# have reddened for a new C-to-BB entry.  This gate is wired into the blocking set in the same landing.  It is
# GREEN at its pins today, so it adds an arm and not a red: it goes red the moment the population rises.
#
# ⭐ WHY A RATCHET IS LEGITIMATE HERE.  test_gate_term_wordref_ratchet.sh's header states the one question that
# makes this shape honest rather than a tripwire on legitimate work -- CAN THIS COUNT REACH ZERO BY DESIGN? --
# and names test_gate_rbp_census_ratchet.sh, which retired its own ratchet because its count could not.  Here
# the answer is Lon's sentence above: every C-to-BB transfer outside the sanctioned initial start is debt the
# fleet is actively deleting, and 0 is the intended terminal value.  The sanctioned sites are NOT in this count
# at all (the underlying gate excludes them before printing), so a legitimate MAIN entry can never trip this.
#
# THE COUNTING METHOD IS NOT A CHOICE -- IT IS THE OTHER GATE'S OWN OUTPUT, PARSED.  Re-deriving the transfer
# set here with a second grep would fork the definition: two gates would drift on what a transfer IS, and the
# ratchet would eventually hold a population the gate does not name.  So this runs the gate (--informational, so
# its own STRICT exit cannot mask this verdict) and counts the site lines it prints, keyed by file.
#
# ⛔ UNPINNED FILE WITH ANY TRANSFER == FAIL.  Without it the ratchet is dodged by moving an entry into a new
# file, which is exactly the motion a conversion produces.  A new file is not a fresh budget.
#
# HOW TO RE-PIN: lower a pin ONLY in the same commit as the landing that earned it, and never above measured --
# slack is the only failure mode that matters in a ratchet.  Run the ONE_LINER at the foot of this file.
