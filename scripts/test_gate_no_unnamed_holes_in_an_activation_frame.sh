# ⭐ WITNESS GATE for CEO-684 slice 1: AN ACTIVATION FRAME RESERVES ONLY WHAT IT NAMES.  --dump-zeta prints the
# typed per-activation frame layout -- every field with its offset, size and kind -- and the sum of those fields
# must TILE the region [16, region_end).  A byte in the region that no field covers is storage the emitter
# reserved, the collector walks past and no template can address: it costs one stack byte per activation forever
# and buys nothing.
# ⛔ WHY A HOLE IS A DEFECT AND NOT A TUNING MATTER, which is the whole reason this is a blocking gate and not a
# report: the cost is INVISIBLE WHEREVER FRAMES ARE RECLAIMED.  A deterministic call drops its frame at once, so
# an over-reserved frame has never shown up in any benchmark we run; it becomes an UNBOUNDED stack cost at exactly
# the moment a frame is RETAINED behind a live choicepoint, which is the Prolog backtracking case (CEO-683/684).
# Measured on r/1 of a four-variable clause: 41 slots, 688 bytes, of which 7 x 16 = 112 bytes are uncovered.
# ⛔ THE GATE IS A TILING CENSUS, NOT A SIZE PIN, deliberately.  Pinning a byte count would red on every legitimate
# change to what a frame CARRIES and would teach the next seat to bump the number; a tiling census only ever fires
# when the layout reserves something it cannot name, which is never correct.  A NAMED pad field (gate.pad,
# resume.pad, callgen.act pad) is COVERED and therefore fine -- the gate is about unnamed reservation.
# ⛔ EVERY FRONTEND, because the granter is language-blind (zls_grant in src/ir/frame_layout.c) and a per-call
# over-reservation reaches all seven: SNOBOL4, Icon and Prolog witnesses here, each chosen to contain calls with
# different arities, because the suspected formula error scales with the NUMBER OF CALLS and not with their size.
# ⛔ REFUSES rc=2 rather than grading when --dump-zeta yields no parsable graph at all -- a runner that cannot
# measure never prints the success shape.
