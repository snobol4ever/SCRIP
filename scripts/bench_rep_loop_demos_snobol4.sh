# bench_rep_loop_demos_snobol4.sh -- LON'S TWO-ASPECT PRESENTATION LAW for the tier-1 -match demos.
# Row: bench-rep-loop-demo-harness (hq_P, 2026-08-28). Authority: ARCH-BENCH-CAMPAIGN-README-TABLES.md.
#
#   ASPECT 1  command-line elapsed -- the WHOLE PROCESS as a user runs it (compile included and
#             LABELED), external rusage, never engine self-timing.
#   ASPECT 2  in-program bracket -- TIME() read by the program itself either side of the FIXTURE,
#             so the MATCH phase is isolated from the pattern-COMPILE phase.
#
# ⛔ WHY ASPECT 2 EXISTS AT ALL, MEASURED NOT ASSUMED: at their committed inputs these demos are
# startup/compile dominated -- treebank-match spends 99.3% of its instructions COMPILING patterns and
# 0.7% matching, claws5-match 99.7%, json-match ~100%. A match-path cure measured on aspect 1 alone
# reads as noise no matter how large it is; that is how the s168 PT-3 collapse (a MEASURED 1.41x) sat
# shipped-but-disabled for eight days with every board green.
#
# ⛔⛔ THE TRAP THIS HARNESS EXISTS TO NOT FALL INTO, AND IT COST A 13x WRONG ANSWER IN CALIBRATION:
# THE FIRST MATCH PAYS LAZY PATTERN COMPILATION. A rep loop with too few reps therefore measures
# COMPILE again, wearing a bracket. Measured on treebank-match, m3 vs the clean oracle:
#     reps=20   0.085x        <- warm-up dominated, WRONG BY 13x
#     reps=200  0.863x
#     reps=2000 1.017x        <- converged
#     reps=20000 1.128x
# ⭐ SO REPS IS NOT A CONSTANT AND IS NOT COMMITTED ANYWHERE. This harness RAMPS reps and REFUSES to
# report until the per-match figure CONVERGES (two successive ramp steps within TOL). A committed
# rep count would be a number nobody could tell had gone stale -- the same class as a scale column
# nobody can justify from a measurement.
#
# ⭐ THE BRACKET GOES TO STDERR (ceo ruling): the correctness anchor and the perf instrument never share
# a channel, so stdout stays byte-identical and every committed .ref and the cross-engine agreement gate
# are untouched. ⛔ It was a temp file until 2026-08-28 only because SCRIP silently discarded every write
# to an OUTPUT association on a file descriptor; hq_C cured that (69178c73) and the defect was WIDER than
# the fd2 symptom -- -f1 was discarded identically. Verified in both modes on the cured build.
