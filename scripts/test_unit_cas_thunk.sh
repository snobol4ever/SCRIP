# ⭐ WHY A UNIT GATE AND NOT A .sno WITNESS: the lambda SURFACE is on hold while Lon redesigns it, so a

# runtime's exported entry points, so it keeps proving the same three properties whatever the surface
# becomes -- and it is the arm that a future surface change must not break.
# ⛔ REFUSES with rc=2 when it cannot measure (no RT built) rather than reporting a green skip.
