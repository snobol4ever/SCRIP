# test_gate_build_governor.sh -- NEGATIVE-TEST gate for row `build-governor-concurrent-pristine`.
#
# This is not a source-scan gate (there is no floor of "files examined") -- it is a behavioral gate on
# lib_build_governor.sh: prove the shared/exclusive exclusion actually excludes, and prove a corrupt/missing/
# unwritable semaphore path is a REFUSAL (rc=2) rather than a silent unguarded pass. Per lib_gate.sh's three-
# way contract: 0 CLEAN, 1 VIOLATION (an assertion below failed), 2 UNPROVEN (flock or the library itself is
# missing, so nothing could be examined).
#
# ⛔ ISOLATION IS LOAD-BEARING: every assertion below runs against a SCRATCH semaphore
# (S4E_GOVERNOR_LOCK, exported before the library is sourced), never the real shared
# /home/resources/postoffice/governor.lock. Up to 16 seats may run this gate at once; a gate run must never
# hold or contend for the real fleet semaphore.
