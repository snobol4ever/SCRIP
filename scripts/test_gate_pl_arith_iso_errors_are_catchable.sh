# test_gate_pl_arith_iso_errors_are_catchable.sh — arithmetic evaluation must raise a CATCHABLE ISO error, and must
# evaluate a variable bound to an unevaluated term (rows prolog-inria-arithmetic-errors-escape-catch3 and
# prolog-inria-is-nested-unevaluated-arithmetic-type-error, hq_R 2026-09-06).
#
# WHAT THIS PINS, AND WHY IT IS TWO ROWS IN ONE GATE. ISO/IEC 13211-1 § 8.6.1 (is/2) and § 8.7.1 (the arithmetic
# comparisons) say each evaluates its arguments and raises on an unbound or non-evaluable operand. SCRIP did three
# different wrong things and they share one cure surface: (1) is/2 raised through rt_pl_iso_throw_*, which is not a
# throw at all -- pl_iso_uncaught() prints to stderr and exit(1)s, so catch/3 never saw it; (2) the comparisons did
# not raise at all, they FAILED silently, which is the more dangerous shape because rc=0 and the goal just goes
# away; (3) an operand that was a variable bound through =/2 to an unevaluated term (X = 1+2, Y is X*3) raised
# type_error(evaluable,+/2) instead of evaluating to 9, because only the COMPILE-TIME expression was ever folded.
#
# ⛔⭐ THE RAISE POPULATION IS GRADED THROUGH catch/3 ON PURPOSE. That is the whole defect: an error that reaches
# the top level as a "Warning: goal raised exception" line looks correct to any grader reading stderr, and is
# invisible to every Prolog program. A witness graded on stderr text would have read GREEN throughout the bug.
#
# ⛔ THE NO-RAISE POPULATION IS THE CONTROL AND IT IS NOT DECORATION. Over-raising is the natural failure mode of
# an evaluation cure: a checker that raises on everything passes a raise-only gate perfectly while breaking every
# working program. So the must-raise witnesses are graded beside the successes and the plain failures ISO requires
# from the same vendored families (3*2 > 7-1 must FAIL, not raise; is(foo,77) must FAIL, not raise).
#
# ⛔ WITNESSES ARE THE VENDORED SUITE'S OWN. Every raise row is an entry of corpus/packages/prolog/inriasuite/
# {is,arith_gt,arith_lt,arith_gt=,arith_lt=,arith_eq,arith_diff} with its expected term copied from that file.
# ⭐ NOTE THE SHAPE OF THE COMPARISON ENTRIES: the suite writes `2 + floot(1) > 5`, so the culprit is NESTED inside
# an evaluable operator. A cure that only validates the comparison's own operands passes `floot(1) =:= 5` and still
# hard-exits on the other four families -- which is exactly how far an earlier arm of this cure got.
#
# ⛔ THE INTEGER-ONLY EVALUABLE FUNCTORS ARE GRADED HERE TOO (xor gcd >> << /\ \/ rem msb \), because they failed
# the same way the comparisons did -- SILENTLY, with rc=0 -- where ISO and swipl both raise type_error(integer,X).
# They share this cure surface exactly: the ball now has somewhere to go. Each is graded beside the value it must
# still compute (6 xor 3 =:= 5, gcd(12,18) =:= 6, msb(8) =:= 3, \(5) =:= -6) -- a raise-only gate would be passed
# by a cure that broke every one of them.
