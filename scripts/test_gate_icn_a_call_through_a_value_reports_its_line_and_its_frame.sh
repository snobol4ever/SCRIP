# test_gate_icn_a_call_through_a_value_reports_its_line_and_its_frame.sh -- A CALL THROUGH A VALUE THAT IS NOT INVOCABLE RAISES 106 AT
# THE LINE ICONX NAMES, AND ITS TRACEBACK ENDS WITH THE ATTEMPTED CALL, IN BOTH MODES (hq_icon 2026-09-27, crawl work under CEO-1270:
# IPL progs/strpsgml, whose every run ends in error 106 from a local that shadows a linked procedure).
#
# Two defects, one report. (1) THE LINE: icont stamps a location on every operation just before it runs it (tcode.c setloc), and iconx
# reports the location in effect at the instruction AFTER the failing invoke -- the invocation's own line, or its parent operation's
# when the invoke is that operation's last operand. SCRIP stamped a call through a value with no line at all, so an error in a do,
# then, else, case or conjunction body reported the line its statement began on. A value call now marks its own line, and keeps no mark
# when it is the last operand of a parent on another line (a mark there would be right for a procedure's frame and wrong for the 106,
# so it stays as it was). (2) THE FRAME: iconx's traceback ends with the attempted call and its arguments undereferenced --
# "&null((variable = "a")) from line 4" -- and SCRIP printed no such frame; rt_call_value_spine_prep also dereferenced the arguments
# before it declined a callee with no name. The error now pushes a builtin frame record that carries the callee, and the decline
# comes first. The rungs cannot grade this -- it discards stderr -- so it is graded here: six witnesses under icont/iconx, m3 and m4,
# stdout and stderr merged and read through the error-voice renderer the suite runners use. On the tree before the cure, w_do, w_then,
# w_case and w_conj differ in the line and every witness differs in the frame (red).
