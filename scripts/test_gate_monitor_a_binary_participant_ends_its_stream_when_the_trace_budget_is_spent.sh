# test_gate_monitor_a_binary_participant_ends_its_stream_when_the_trace_budget_is_spent.sh -- a binary monitor participant
# whose trace budget runs out goes quiet on the wire and ENDs its stream at exit; it never speaks the text protocol on the
# binary wire (cto 2026-09-26, row monitor-comm-var-falls-through-to-the-text-protocol-once-the-trace-budget-is-spent-...,
# measured by the coo 2026-09-25 21:2x and ruled at CEO-1274 (6)). THE DEFECT: comm_var in src/runtime/core/core.c returned
# early only while g_trace_budget was non-zero; at zero it fell through to the text mon_send VALUE, which g_monitor_bin did
# not guard, so the participant wrote nine text bytes onto the binary wire and blocked forever on an ack the reader could
# not send (it was waiting for the other four bytes of a 13-byte header) until the timeout killed it.
# THE WITNESS: a 20-iteration SNOBOL4 loop under SCRIP_TRACE=10 (ten events, then silence) with MONITOR_BIN=1 and an
# acking reader (scripts/monitor/read_one_wire.py, which stops on END). Two arms, one per mode:
#   the participant exits 0 within its timeout (124 is the wedge), its program ran to completion after the budget,
#   the reader saw exactly BUDGET traced records plus the exit LABEL, then ONE END record, last.
# FAIL-ONCE: on 6974ab821 (before the cure) both arms read RED -- rc=124, ten records, no END (the commit that lands
# this gate records that reading).
