# test_gate_pl_stream_property_sees_the_standard_streams_before_any_file_operation.sh -- the FIRST
# stream_property/2 of a program, asked before any open, read or write has touched the file-handle table,
# must still find user_input and its properties (the coo's bisect 2026-09-30: Logtalk stream_property_2
# read 58/72 from 9d3f8a061 on, cases 08a..13; FIRST BAD the cto's one-show batch 2d-1).
#
# THE REGRESSION THIS PINS, AND IT WAS MINE. 9d3f8a061 turned g_fh[64] into a grown vector whose three
# standard slots are made by fh_ensure_init on first use. The g_fh accessor initialized; the FH_N length
# macro did not, so a leaf that bounded its index by FH_N before touching g_fh (pl_sp_count, pl_sp_nth,
# pl_sp_check) read a length of 0 and the enumeration had no streams at all. The first
# stream_property(S, alias(user_input)) failed; every later one, after some write had initialized the
# table, answered. FH_N now initializes exactly as g_fh does (driver_private.h).
#
# ⛔ The witness asks its first stream_property BEFORE writing anything: a write first would initialize the
# table and the gate would read green on the broken binary. The lines are the ones swipl 9 and gprolog 1.4.5
# agree on (they disagree on user_input's eof_action, so that property is not graded here; the Logtalk suite
# grades it as ISO states it).
# rc 0 green · 1 red · 2 could not measure.
