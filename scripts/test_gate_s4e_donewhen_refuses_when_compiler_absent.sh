# test_gate_s4e_donewhen_refuses_when_compiler_absent.sh -- a DONE-WHEN that DRIVES THE COMPILER is REFUSED (rc=2),

# pascal-m4-site1-forloop-backedge-64byte-excess: the criterion's compile step reads
#     timeout 300s SCRIP/scrip --compile ... || { echo "compile failed"; exit 1; }
# so a MISSING binary reported rc=1 -- "real work here", served SILENTLY by the dispatch probe -- instead of rc=2
# -- "could not measure", served WITH a warning. The ceo root's scrip was built 21 minutes AFTER the assign.
# V2-5's three exit codes apply to criteria, not only to gates; and the cure is ONE guard in s4e_msg.sh
# (s4e_donewhen_needs_compiler, at both runner sites) rather than a sweep of the 88 batons that carry the shape.
# THREE ARMS against a THROWAWAY postoffice under mktemp -- never the live one:
#   (1) DISPATCH-WARNS  `next` serves a compiler-driving row WITH the could-not-measure warning naming the binary,
#                       and does NOT close it.
#   (2) DONE-REFUSES    `done` on that row exits 2, names the binary, leaves claim and column untouched.
#   (3) SCOPE           a criterion that never names the compiler is untouched: `done` on a plain red row still
#                       exits 1 -- the guard must not turn every red into a refusal.
# FAIL-ONCE: mutant M1 strips the guard from a copy of s4e_msg.sh -- arms 1 and 2 must go red on it.
# EXIT 0 all arms hold on the real script and the mutant goes red; 1 otherwise; 2 REFUSED (fixture unbuildable).
