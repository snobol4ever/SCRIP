# regenerate_parser_and_lexer_from_sources.sh -- regenerate the committed bison/flex outputs from their .y/.l sources.
# Run after editing any .y or .l; commit the source and its generated .tab.c/.tab.h/.lex.c together (the outputs are committed so a normal
# build never needs bison/flex). Every parser is generated from INSIDE its own directory with the output's bare basename: bison bakes the
# input path into #line and the output basename into an #include and an include guard, so generating from anywhere else rewrites every
# committed file with pure path noise (GOAL-STYLE-200COL R4 measured it: 10 files, 4 non-#line lines; snobol4.tab.h carried a
# SRC_PARSER_ guard from a root-relative run for months). The Snocone lexer is a hand-written FSM (snocone_lex.c), not a flex source.
# ⛔ A generated file is NEVER hand-edited: the June 2026 dead-code sweeps pruned lex.rebus.c and snocone_parse.tab.c by hand, and from then
# on neither could be reproduced from its source (hq_B 2026-09-02 FINDING). Cure at the SOURCE (%option noinput nounput; delete the dead
# helper from the .y) and regenerate; prove it with scripts/util_style200_oracle_yl.sh.
# Tools: bison 3.8.2 / flex 2.6.4 -- gen_tools_ready (lib_build_flags.sh) resolves BISON_PKGDATADIR for the rootless ~/.local install and
# PROVES bison generates before anything is touched. Usage: bash scripts/regenerate_parser_and_lexer_from_sources.sh
