# test_gate_s_artifacts_verifier_stale_binary_refuses.sh -- THE ACCEPTANCE GATE for the stale-binary preflight in
# util_verify_s_artifacts_owed.sh (row s-artifacts-verifier-refuses-when-scrip-predates-the-newest-src-commit).
#
# WHAT IT PROVES, in BOTH directions, hermetically and in under a second:
#   (a) STALE -> REFUSE : a ./scrip whose mtime predates the newest src/ change makes the verifier exit rc=2 with
#       a REFUSED-TO-GRADE verdict. ⛔ It must NOT print an owed count: an OWED number BLOCKS a handoff, so a stale
#       binary would block it on debt that does not exist on origin (measured hq_B 2026-09-02: OWED 26 at rung-6
#       HEAD from a binary built 17 minutes before rung 6 landed; 0 owed after make pristine).
#   (b) FRESH -> PROCEED : a current binary passes the preflight and the run continues to the next check. Without
#       this arm the gate would pass against a script that refuses unconditionally, which is a different lie.
#   (c) ABSENT -> REFUSE : no binary at all still refuses rc=2 (the pre-existing contract, kept).
#   (d) The refusal is ACTIONABLE: it names both timestamps and the cure. A refusal that does not say what to do
#       sends the reader to doubt the gate, which is exactly the failure this row exists to stop.
#
# ⛔ HERMETIC AND NON-DESTRUCTIVE: every arm points the script under test at a THROWAWAY binary path via SCRIP=
# and at a deliberately-absent CORPUS, so the real ./scrip is never touched (not even its mtime -- faking currency
# on the real binary to test a currency check would be the same class of lie the check exists to catch) and no
# clone, build or regen ever runs. Arms (b) and (c) reach the corpus check and stop there; that rc=2 is EXPECTED
# and is the proof the preflight let them past, so each arm asserts on the OUTPUT TEXT, never on rc alone.
# SUT= overrides the script under test -- used to prove this gate FAILS against the pre-cure verifier (fail-once).
