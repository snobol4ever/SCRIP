# test_gate_raku_roast_runner_leaves_the_checkout_clean.sh -- A ROAST CASE THAT WRITES A FILE WHERE IT STANDS WRITES IT
# IN A SCRATCH DIRECTORY, NEVER IN THE CHECKOUT THE RUNNER GRADES (coo 2026-10-09).
# MEASURED: pass 42 (SCRIP cfcfaf46d) ran raku_roast_scoreboard.sh --run with cwd = the checkout, and roast's IO tests wrote
# 16 files there (.tmp-test-file, temp-evalfile.*, io-native-descriptor-testfile, names holding a literal \0 ...). The runner's
# own row write then REFUSED the dirty tree ("SCRIP has uncommitted"), so a whole Roast run (96/1464 both modes) published no
# row -- and a dirty checkout makes every board after it grade a tree nobody can check out.
# THE FIXTURE (outside corpus, under mktemp): a two-file roast tree -- write.t spurts a file into its cwd and checks it is
# there; plain.t passes -- with its own manifest and attribute table, graded by the real runner in its NON-PUBLISHING mode
# (--limit), a scratch progress table, no score write.
#   ARM 1  the runner measures the fixture (its board line names 2 files)
#   ARM 2  write.t PASSES in m3: a case can still write where it stands -- it stands in its own scratch directory
#   ARM 3  the checkout gains NO file: git status --porcelain is the same before and after the run
# FAIL-ONCE: on the runner before incwd(), arm 3 reads the fixture's file in the checkout and reds (measured by hand on
# 3de1f00bb; this gate removes that file if it ever finds one, so a red run never leaves the checkout dirty).
# EXIT: 0 all arms pass · 1 an arm failed · 2 could not measure.
