# test_gate_perf_fmt_refuses_a_dark_cell.sh -- ⭐ THE DARK-CELL LAW, LOCKED (CEO-676; hq_P 2026-09-13).
#
# A benchmark arm that cannot measure its subject must REFUSE, naming the subject -- it must never
# emit a blank cell, and a grid must refuse to publish a column it could not fill.  This gate holds
# lib_perf_fmt.sh, THE ONE AUTHORITY for printing a multiple, to that law.
#
# ⛔ WHAT IT IS GUARDING AGAINST, MEASURED ON THIS TREE BEFORE THE CURE -- every one of these exited
# rc=0, so a caller, a grid and a reader all saw success:
#     perf_mult 100 0      -> "n/a"        a blank cell, read as a measurement that came back empty
#     perf_mult 0   100    -> "0.000x"     ⛔ FABRICATED: a NUMBER.  It sorts, it colours RED, it gets quoted
#     perf_mult 100 ERROR  -> "n/a"        awk's `v + 0` turned a string into 0 and then into a cell
#     perf_mult 100 -5     -> "-20.000x"   ⛔ a NEGATIVE multiple, printed and coloured like a reading
# The last two were found by this gate's own author while writing it, which is the argument for the gate.
#
# ⛔ THIS GATE REFUSES rc=2 RATHER THAN SKIPPING when it cannot measure (no lib, no bash): a test that
# cannot run must never report the same string as one that passed.
