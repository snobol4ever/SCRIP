# test_gate_sno_parser_refuses_at_compile_time_what_spitbol_refuses.sh -- the first product of the grammar-based harness
# (Lon and the ceo, 2026-10-01, CEO-1393): gen_every_snobol4.icn enumerated every OUTPUT = <expression> statement of at
# most 3 tokens (10834) and each went through SCRIP's parser (out/parser_snobol4) and through sbl -bf; where the oracle
# refuses a statement AT COMPILE TIME and SCRIP's parser accepts it, SCRIP grades a compile refusal as a runtime answer.
# Three classes, one witness each, canonical shapes from the census (699 statements of the first two kinds, 20 of the
# third): a literal as the target of = . $ or under unary @ and & ('a' = X); literal-only arithmetic with a type clash,
# which SPITBOL folds and refuses at compile time ('a' + 1); a keyword name carrying a trailing dot, one name to the
# oracle's lexer and a parse refusal in SCRIP (&ANCHOR. X). Each arm wants the two verdicts EQUAL; the arm is red today.
#   bash scripts/test_gate_sno_parser_refuses_at_compile_time_what_spitbol_refuses.sh [ARM]   -- one class arm alone (a row's DONE-WHEN)
# ⛔ `make` never builds out/parser_* (all: is scrip and scrip-ipp); `make parsers` does. A parser binary older than
# src/tools/parser_main.c is REFUSED rc=2: one built before ae0a91289 returned 0 on a SNOBOL4 parse error, so the self-proof's
# control-refuse read ACCEPT and the gate red for a reason that was not SCRIP's parser (the cto and the cfo, 2026-10-03).
