design .github/ARCH-GC-COMPILE-TIME-FRAME-MAPS.md, law RULES.md FACT RULE THE COLLECTOR GUESSES NOTHING).

Five censuses, each a mechanical count printed with its population, each RED until the design lands and each proven
to trip on a planted violation by --selftest (39 arms, the ratchet included):

  conservative   src/runtime/rt/gc_heap.c: call sites of the word walker gc_zeta_frame(, uses of cons_stack, of
                 rt_cas_live_span and of hb_scan_interior (Rule 2, Rule 2b).  Want 0 each.
  allocator      rt_gc_collect( inside rt_gcheap_alloc's body (Rule 3: the allocator never collects).  Want 0.
  safe-points    every ALLOCATING runtime entry the emitter calls has a g_gc_pending poll at its emitted return.  The
                 allocating set is read from the runtime binary's own call graph (objdump: every function that reaches
                 rt_gcheap_alloc), never from a hand list; the emitter's call sites are the literal x86("call", "sym")
                 strings in src/templates and src/emitter; a poll is a g_gc_pending reference (or a helper named in
                 --poll-helper) within --poll-window source lines after the call.  Want unpolled 0 and unresolved 0.
  coverage       a run under SCRIP_GC_STRESS=64 SCRIP_GC_COVERAGE=1 prints [GC-COV] lines; every line must carry BOTH
                 words_scanned=0 (stack and spine words visited without a map, Rule 2) and interior_words=0 (mark-
                 worklist payload words visited by the same sniff, Rule 2b).  A line without a token is RED (the
                 design's field is not there yet); no line at all is rc=2 (no collection ran: not measured).  The two
                 spellings are FROZEN -- the cfo's walker row prints them, this census only counts them.
  callbacks      TWO DIRECTIONS, each with its own denominator, both printed.  INBOUND: every call into the by-name
                 dispatcher (the rt_call_* family) from a runtime frame.  OUTBOUND: every call OUT of the runtime
                 into emitted code through the apply / user-call hook chain -- CEO-836's gdb crash class, where the
                 raw heap `const char *fn` is live across `APPLY_fn(fn, args, nargs)` and comes back reading "\003".
                 The scope is DERIVED (every .c/.h under src/runtime and src/driver), the inbound set is derived by
                 name shape, the OUTBOUND set is DECLARED and says so, and a declared symbol that has vanished from
                 the tree REFUSES rc=2 rather than report a stale zero.  Both must sit inside RT_GC_CALLBACK(
                 (Rule 4; the marker is the cfo's to confirm) -- and whether that marker is DEFINED in the tree at
                 all is printed beside the count, because wrapped=0 with no definition is not progress pending.
                 Want unwrapped 0 on both.
  maps           TWO HALVES, printed and graded separately, because a green slot-kind half beside an absent table would
                 read as if the design existed.  SLOT-KIND: the ceo's util_zls_frame_map_census.py over each language's
                 master (token frozen CEO-821), want unkinded=0 and holes=0, with no_layout NAMED beside the number and
                 never folded into it; the wire header past region_end and the spine are NAMED as not censused here
                 (section 2b makes the spine tagged cells, so its census is the tag census, not a hole count).
                 TABLE: section 6.4, from three independent producers per witness -- the frame allocator (--dump-zeta),
                 the emitter (SCRIP_GC_MAPS_REPORT=1, BOTH media) and the assembler text (.Lgcmap_* labels, their
                 prologue leas, the counted __gc_frame_maps table and each map's four decoded quads).  REFUSES rc=2
                 while gc_heap.c defines no rt_gc_frame_maps_install.

rc: 0 every census green; 1 any census red; 2 a census could not measure (missing file, no binary, no collection).
Every count is printed as `CENSUS <name> ... want=...` so a reader re-derives the population, never only the verdict.

# carve by a TAIL JUMP (`jmp .Lga_armed` on the armed path, `je c_rt_str_alloc` to the C fallback otherwise)
# and never execute a `call rt_gcheap_alloc`, so BOTH of them and everything that reaches the heap only
# through them read as NON-ALLOCATING: 99 functions, the SNOBOL4 string builtins among them (DUPL_fn,
# REVERS_fn, SUBSTR_fn, TRIM_fn, BCHAR_fn, _CHAR_, _COLLECT_, _ITEM_ ...).  Downstream that put 27 emitter
# call sites OUTSIDE THE DENOMINATOR ENTIRELY -- neither polled nor counted unpolled -- in the number the GC
# emergency is steered by.  A tail jump is an edge for exactly the question this census asks: control reaches
# the target, the target may allocate, and it returns past us to OUR caller, so the allocation happens with
# the caller's frame live.  objdump prints a jump to a local label as <fn+0xNN>, and the symbol pattern below
# refuses a '+', so only true inter-function transfers are recorded; a self-edge is dropped.

    "DIRECTIONS. polled 190 -> 190, partially_polled 0 -> 6, unpolled 63 -> 57, identity 190 + 6 + 57 == 253. "
    "(a) MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE STATEMENT ARMS: emit.cpp's icn_trace_tap and xa_flat.cpp's xa_icn_trace_tap are an "
    "if/else-if/else chain of allocating hook calls followed by ONE poll; the base predicate read each arm's "
    "SUCCESSOR ARM as a later call and stopped the window, so six sites read UNPOLLED. _stmt_sibling_offsets is "
    "the statement-level twin of _ternary_sibling_offsets, which COO-146 named and did not mechanize. "
    "(b) THE CONDITIONAL SKIP, THE ONLY SPECIES THAT MADE THE NUMBER TOO BIG (ceo, CEO-1132): the guard's `je` is "
    "emitted ABOVE the call and its landing pad BELOW the poll, so a reader looking only BETWEEN them sees nothing "
    "and credits a poll that is stepped over whenever g_trace == 0 -- which is every program that never assigns "
    "&trace. Two sites were credited that way; they are PARTIAL now, not polled. "
    "(c) THE GUARD IS ITSELF CONDITIONAL: IF(kind == 2 || kind == 3 || kind == 5, ... je) in emit.cpp and "
    "IF(kind != 1, ...) in xa_flat.cpp are NOT emitted on the kind == 1 arm, whose poll is unconditional. Reading "
    "(b) without (c) would have condemned two sound arms. "
    "(d) A SIBLING ARM IS NOT A GUARD: _poll_is_guarded matched `else if (kind == 2)` with its plain `if (` test "
    "and called xa_flat.cpp:427 PARTIAL although its poll is unconditional -- the same alternatives-as-sequence "
    "confusion at a FOURTH level. "
    "⭐ MEASURED FROM EMITTED BYTES BEFORE A LINE OF THE READER WAS WRITTEN, and the reader then reproduced the "
    "predicted 190/6/57 independently: `./scrip --compile` on a two-procedure Icon witness shows each kind 2/3 tap "
    "as cmp/je -> hook -> rt_gc_poll_asm -> landing pad (lines 131/142/149/153), and each kind 1 tap as hook -> "
    "rt_gc_poll_asm with no branch at all. `long g_trace = 0` is src/runtime/keywords.c:17. "
    "⛔ partially_polled IS NOW RATCHETED. It was printed, demanded zero by the census header, and watched by "
    "NOTHING; six sites could have become sixty with every gate green. "
    "⛔ AND THE CENSUS NOW REFUSES rc=2 ON A STALE BUILD (ceo CEO-1147 calls this the sharpest of the four): "
    "census_safe_points derives its DENOMINATOR from out/libscrip_rt.so via allocating_entries_from_binary, so an "
    "unbuilt tree does not merely date the verdict, it changes WHICH CALLS ARE COUNTED. Witnessed both ways at the "
    "landing. lib_build_currency.sh is SOURCED, never reimplemented, and there is deliberately no escape hatch.",
    "2026-09-22 coo, SCRIP this landing (CEO-1119, on the coo's measured delta): safe-points. A POLL THAT FOLLOWS "
    "A LATER CALL IS THAT CALL'S SAFE POINT. The base predicate's poll window now stops at the first intervening "
    "emitted call, the stop the expansion-site window has carried since CEO-1116 -- the SAME defect one level up, "
    "held back at COO-142 because it moves the published headline and that is the ceo's call. polled 156 -> 149, "
    "unpolled 97 -> 104 on SCRIP 20424784f. ⭐ THE RISE IS THE INSTRUMENT GETTING HONEST, NOT THE TREE GETTING "
    "WORSE (ceo, CEO-1119, the CEO-935 shape): the ratchet REFUSES a rise by design, so the baseline is raised in "
    "this same landing. This SUPERSEDES the ceo's NEXT MOVE note carried below, which forecast this change -- it "
    "is history now, not a forecast. ⛔ THE MECHANICAL ARM ALONE READS 148, NOT 149, AND THE DIFFERENCE IS THE "
    "WHOLE POINT: a mechanical stop can NOMINATE a site and cannot CONVICT one (the symmetric half of the ceo's "
    "own law that a static reader can reject a site and cannot clear one). Sixteen first nominations, nine thrown "
    "away by hand, seven published. The ninth rejection -- bb_call_value.cpp:130, where the intervening call at "
    ":134 sits inside the ELSE arm opened at :131 -- was named at COO-143 as an unmechanized blind spot rather "
    "than rounded away, and THIS landing mechanizes it: _ternary_sibling_offsets tracks an ARM INDEX PER PAREN "
    "DEPTH, so a line in a different arm of a ternary the site also stands in is an ALTERNATIVE, never a "
    "successor. It replaces the leading-character exemption entirely -- one rule, not two -- and reproduces the "
    "hand-read name set of 104 EXACTLY, name for name, not merely the count. ⛔ TWO EARLIER SHAPES OF THAT RULE "
    "WERE WRONG AND BOTH WERE CAUGHT BY MEASURING AGAINST THE HAND-READ NAMES RATHER THAN AGAINST A COUNT: a "
    "line-granular reader re-nominated the five sites whose '?' is on their own line (bb_iterate.cpp:27/:28/:29, "
    "bb_field_get.cpp:21/:39), and a latching one CLEARED THREE the hand read convicted "
    "(bb_match_capture.cpp:124/:163, bb_rev_assign_var.cpp:19) because it read the arm the site LIVES IN as an arm "
    "the site is excluded from. Five planted selftest arms hold both directions, each proven able to go red "
    "(selftest 47 -> 52 arms). SCRIP_GC_CENSUS_BASE_CALL_STOP=0 reproduces the pre-CEO-1119 reading and was "
    "verified byte-identical on all 97 names.",
    "2026-09-22 coo, SCRIP this landing (CEO-1109, the cto's finding): safe-points. ONE SOURCE CALL LINE IS NOT ONE "
    "EMITTED PATH. The predicate reads SOURCE PROXIMITY while POLLED is a claim about EMITTED CONTROL FLOW, and the "
    "emitter concatenates strings, so a call written once inside a file-local helper or a #define is spliced into "
    "every path that expands that unit. TWO NEW COLUMNS, multi_path_sites and partially_polled, and partially_polled "
    "is NOT counted in polled. ⛔ THE HEADLINE DOES NOT MOVE ON THIS TREE -- 152 of 253 before and after, "
    "partially_polled=0 -- so this is the instrument gaining a verdict it did not have, not a landing and not a "
    "regression. WHAT MOVES IS WHAT IT CAN SEE: 58 of the 253 sites are multi-path and were previously graded by a "
    "window that cannot distinguish one path from four. MEASURED PROOF THAT THE EXPOSURE WAS REAL, not argued: a poll "
    "planted under IF(g_gva_active) in bb_assign_global's comm_var tap reaches TWO of its FOUR expansions, and the old "
    "criterion read it polled=153 unpolled=100 and dropped the site from the worklist; the new one reads it PARTIAL "
    "and leaves polled at 152. ⛔ THE PATH COUNT IS AN UPPER BOUND AND SAYS SO: emit.cpp's icn_trace_tap expands at "
    "six sites but its call lines sit in mutually exclusive caller-selected arms, so the kind==2 call at :2914 is "
    "reached by one of the six. ⛔ AND ONE STOP RULE IS LOAD-BEARING, caught by reading the output rather than by "
    "writing the rule: an expansion-site window stops at the first intervening emitted call, because without it the "
    "reader credited NV_SET_fn's x86_rt_gc_poll_rec_res() to the comm_var tap spliced in above it and reported 2 of 4 "
    "paths polling on a tap the cto had deliberately left unpolled.",

    "collections. A zero from a walker that was mis-started is not a small number, it is NOT A MEASUREMENT, and the "

    "the poison-fill arm are decidable on 5dd2d79f0 or later, never before it.",
    "2026-09-17 coo, same sitting: safe-points. THE CENSUS IS TOLD HOW TO READ A COMPUTED TARGET -- array, macro, "
    "chooser and resolver-out-parameter, each named beside the site it resolves. The last 7 UNRESOLVED sites entered "
    "the denominator: unresolved 7 -> 0, allocating_call_sites 203 -> 210, unpolled 203 -> 210. Three of the seven are "
    "the Prolog direct-dispatch registry (dop_direct_fp, 172 allocating targets among 504 literals) and two are the "

    "2026-09-17 coo, SCRIP this landing: CALLBACKS, ON CEO-836's WORD THAT THE NUMBER IS NOW LOAD-BEARING. The "
    "63 was wrong three ways and the third is the one that mattered. (i) THE SCOPE WAS TWO HAND-NAMED FILES AND "
    "ONE OF THEM HOLDS NO SITE: gen_runtime.c contributes zero, so the census read ONE file while naming two, and "
    "FIVE real sites of the identical class stood outside any denominator, in pattern_match.c, rt/rt.c and "
    "core/core.c. The scope is now DERIVED by walking src/runtime and src/driver -- 86 files. (ii) A "
    "DECLARATION IS NOT A CALL SITE: the filter tested the line's TERMINATOR, so a prototype ending ';' and a "
    "one-line definition ending '}' both counted -- FIFTEEN of the 63 were declarations, including five of the "
    "rt_call_arr_* forwarders at by_name_dispatch.c:5167-5171. The test is now the declarator prefix BEFORE the "
    "name, with the C keywords that may precede a call excluded. (iii) THE CRASH THE NUMBER IS SUPPOSED TO BOUND "
    "WAS NOT IN IT: the regex matched calls TO the dispatcher and never the callback OUT of it, so "
    "by_name_dispatch.c:5260 `out = APPLY_fn(fn, args, nargs);` -- the exact gdb site CEO-836 traced, the raw heap "

    "printed population over a DECLARED set (APPLY_fn, _usercall_hook, rt_chain_enter, rt_chain_enter_v) that "

# silence).  Measured 2026-09-17 on SCRIP e625d1b35 by the coo: 32 of the 39 UNRESOLVED sites were plain string
# literals the census could not spell, and two of them -- rt_proc_call_epilogue_named_γ and _ω, at

# ⛔ ONE SOURCE CALL LINE IS NOT ONE EMITTED PATH, AND UNTIL 2026-09-22 THIS CENSUS ASSUMED IT WAS.  The emitter
# builds its output by string concatenation, so a call site written ONCE inside a file-local helper or a #define is
# SPLICED INTO EVERY PATH THAT EXPANDS THAT UNIT.  The poll predicate below reads SOURCE PROXIMITY -- poll text within
# --poll-window lines after the call -- which is a question about the source file, while POLLED is a claim about
# emitted control flow.  Where a unit expands more than once the two come apart, and they come apart in the WORST
# DIRECTION: one poll in the shared body reads the site fully POLLED however many of its paths actually carry it.
# FOUND BY THE cto, NOT BY READING THIS CODE (CEO-1109, relayed by the ceo 2026-09-22): bb_assign_global's comm_var
# tap is ONE x86("call", ...) line spliced into FOUR paths, and at one of them the fresh string is live only in
# rax:rdx and rooted nowhere -- so polling the rooted paths alone would have read the site POLLED with a quarter of
# it still uncollectable.  THEY DECLINED AND LEFT IT UNPOLLED, which is why this is a criterion change and not a
# retraction of somebody's landing.
#
# WHAT THIS READER DOES AND, MORE IMPORTANTLY, WHAT IT DOES NOT.  It finds the FUNCTION or MACRO body that textually
# contains each call site and counts that unit's EXPANSION SITES across the emitter files.  That count is an UPPER
# BOUND on the paths reaching the site, never an exact figure, and the bound is named in the output rather than
# rounded away.  Measured reason, 2026-09-22 by the coo, on emit.cpp's icn_trace_tap: the helper is expanded at six
# sites, but its four call lines sit in MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE arms selected by the caller's `kind` argument, so the
# kind==2 call at :2914 is reached by exactly ONE of the six.  A reader that followed argument-selected arms would
# say 1; this one says 6 and SAYS THAT IT IS AN UPPER BOUND.
# ⛔ AND THE FIRST VERSION OF THIS READER WAS WRONG IN A WAY WORTH RECORDING, because it is the same error the row
# exists to cure: it took "nearest preceding function definition" as the enclosing unit, which put
# bb_binop_arith.cpp:137 inside rtop_addr_s() -- a function whose name merely appears in the call's ARGUMENT list --
# and reported 32 multi-path sites off that reading.  The site is really inside the inl_tail() MACRO.  Brace depth is
# tracked from column 0 and #define continuations own their lines, so a macro body is a unit and an argument is not.

    BETWEEN THE MECHANICAL ARM'S 148 AND THE 149 THE ceo PUBLISHED (CEO-1119).  bb_call_value.cpp:130 is the last
    line of the THEN arm of the ternary opened at :126; the ELSE arm opens at :131 with a leading ':' and RUNS ON

    :134 -- the same confusion of EXCLUSIVE ARMS with SEQUENCE that COO-142 recorded in the expansion-path reader and
    COO-143 recorded in this one, now at its third level.

    THE MODEL IS AN ARM INDEX PER PAREN DEPTH, and it is the third one written: each '?' and each ':' at depth d
    starts the next arm of the ternary living at that depth, and the whole chain `a ? X : b ? Y : Z` is one ternary
    with four arm indices.  The call records the arm it stands in at EVERY depth that has one; a later position is an
    alternative when any of those depths is still open and has moved on to a different arm.  Leaving a depth (a ')'
    below it, or a ';') forgets it, so a fresh ternary reopening at the same depth can never be mistaken for the
    site's own.

    ⛔ TWO EARLIER SHAPES OF THIS RULE WERE WRONG IN THE DIRECTION THAT CLEARS SITES, AND BOTH WERE CAUGHT BY
    MEASURING AGAINST THE HAND-READ NAME SET RATHER THAN AGAINST A COUNT.  (a) A LINE-GRANULAR reader that looked
    only ABOVE the site for its '?' missed all five sites whose '?' is on their OWN line -- bb_iterate.cpp:27, which
    is `+ (key ? x86("call", ...)` with three ':' arms below it, and bb_field_get.cpp:21, where the sibling that
    matters is the OUTER ternary's ':' on the next line at a SHALLOWER depth -- and re-nominated them.  (b) A reader
    that latched an 'in alternative' flag the moment it saw a ':' at an open-arm depth CLEARED THREE SITES A HAND
    READ CONVICTED: at bb_rev_assign_var.cpp:14 the guard's ':' on line 15 opens the arm the site at :19 LIVES IN,
    so every later line is that same arm -- a SUCCESSOR -- and the real intervening call at :26 was being exempted.
    An arm the site is inside is not an arm the site is excluded from.
