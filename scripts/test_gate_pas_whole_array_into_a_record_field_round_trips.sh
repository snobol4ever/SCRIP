# ROW pascal-a-whole-array-assigned-into-a-record-field-reads-back-wrong-collapse-pack-and-the-dense-field-interior-to-one-authority
# (hq_pascal 2026-09-20, ranked first by CEO-1021).  FAIL-ONCE ON ORIGIN 5418432bb: `r.name := t` and `p^.name := t` both read back
# `09899` where fpc -Miso reads `bcdefghi`, in BOTH modes, AT THE SHIPPED ARENA WITH NO STRESS -- a silent wrong answer, exit 0, no
# diagnostic, with no collector anywhere near it.
#
# THE MECHANISM THIS GATE HOLDS, so a future reader knows what it is protecting: a Pascal array value is a SOH-separated string, but a
# record FIELD INTERIOR is DENSE -- __pas_field_idx_set writes element n at byte offset n-1 with no separator.  __pas_ca_pack must
# therefore hand __pas_field_set a DENSE string and __pas_ca_unpack must explode a dense field back into SOH-separated elements.
# DENSE IS THE AUTHORITY because the per-element writer and the reader already agree on it (CEO-1021: collapse to the authority, do
# not synchronise the copies).  If someone makes pack separated again, the per-element form keeps working and only this gate trips.
#
# ⛔ THE FOUR ARMS ARE A BRACKET, NOT A SUITE: `plainarray` and `ptrperchar` were ALREADY CORRECT before the cure and are here as the
# CONTROL -- if a cure breaks them it traded one defect for another, and a gate that graded only the two broken forms could not say so.
# The ref is CUT FROM fpc -Miso at run time, never pinned by hand.
