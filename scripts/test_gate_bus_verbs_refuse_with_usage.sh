# test_gate_bus_verbs_refuse_with_usage.sh -- a bus verb invoked with a missing argument REFUSES rc=2 with a
# USAGE MESSAGE, never with a bash diagnostic, and writes nothing.
# cto -> coo 2026-09-20, REPORTED rather than cured because the bus is the coo's instrument. MEASURED,
# verbatim from the cto's terminal on SCRIP d6b8a02c4 and reproduced before the cure: `s4e_msg.sh park` with
# no topic printed the unread banner and then `scripts/s4e_msg.sh: line 2067: 2: topic` and nothing else --
# `${2:?topic}` firing, i.e. the SHELL's unbound-parameter message, naming a LINE NUMBER and the bare word
# `topic` to a seat who was reaching for the board.
# ⛔ THE COST IS NOT THE MISSING HELP, IT IS WHAT IT READS AS: a line-numbered shell error reads as A BROKEN
# BUS rather than as a usage error, so the seat stops to investigate the tool instead of retyping the command,
# and a seat that cannot see the board picks its next row blind. TEN VERBS SHARED THE SHAPE, so it was never
# one verb's typo -- which is why this gate grades the POPULATION and not the one verb that was reported.
# FOUR ARMS over a scratch postoffice under mktemp -- never the live one:
#   (1) RC       every verb in the table exits 2 (could-not-act), never 0 and never 1. rc=2 is the vocabulary
#                every other refusal in this file speaks, so a caller can tell it from a measured red.
#   (2) USAGE    each refusal prints `usage:` AND names the verb the seat typed. A refusal that does not say
#                what to type instead is the bash diagnostic again in nicer words.
#   (3) NO-SHELL-DIAGNOSTIC  ⛔ THE ARM THAT GRADES THE ACTUAL DEFECT: the output must contain no `line N:`
#                and no `unbound variable`. This is what the cto saw, and it is the one property a
#                well-meaning usage message added ALONGSIDE the old expansion would still fail.
#   (4) WROTE-NOTHING  the whole scratch postoffice is byte-identical before and after every refusal. A
#                refusal that mutates is not a refusal, and this is the property nobody would notice breaking.
#   (5) NO-REGRESSION  no NEW `${N:?word}` site: the bare-word form is the defect's shape, and a gate that
#                only grades today's ten verbs cannot see the eleventh verb minted tomorrow.
# FAIL-ONCE: three mutants -- M1 restores `${2:?topic}` on park (arms 1 and 3 red), M2 makes the helper exit 1
# (arm 1 red), M3 makes it print no usage line (arm 2 red). EXIT 0 all arms hold and all three mutants go red;
# 1 otherwise; 2 REFUSED (fixture unbuildable).
