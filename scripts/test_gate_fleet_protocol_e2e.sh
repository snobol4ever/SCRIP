# WHY THIS EXISTS: V2-1's gate tests the picker and V2-4's tests identity, but NOTHING tested the loop a
# seat actually runs — check → next → work → suspend → resume → done → board — or the four baton ports.
# The hole that proves the point: `done` appended the DONE marker UNCONDITIONALLY and never ran the task's
# DONE-WHEN, so the one command whose job is to certify completion took the seat's word for it. Two gates
# were green over that for a whole session because neither of them ran a whole lifecycle.
#
# ⛔ NEGATIVE-TESTED: S4E_MSG_BIN=<older script> must FAIL this gate. A gate that cannot say NO is not a gate.
