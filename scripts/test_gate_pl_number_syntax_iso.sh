# test_gate_pl_number_syntax_iso.sh — number_chars/2 and number_codes/2 must PARSE the list argument and unify
# NUMERICALLY, and must accept the ISO number syntax (row
# flip-inria-number-chars-and-codes-reject-exponent-and-character-code-number-syntax, hq_R 2026-09-06).
#
# WHAT THIS PINS. ISO/IEC 13211-1 § 8.16.7/8.16.8 with § 6.4.4: when the list argument of number_chars/2 or
# number_codes/2 is a proper list, it is PARSED and the resulting NUMBER is unified with the first argument.
# SCRIP failed silently on four INRIA goals, and the four are TWO different defects that share one choke point:
#   (a) DIRECTION — with the first argument BOUND, the leaf converted it to CANONICAL TEXT and unified TEXT
#       LISTS, so number_chars(3.3,['3','.','3','E','+','0']) compared "3.3" against "3.3E+0" and failed.
#       ⛔ Exponent parsing was never the problem and the row's own mint text said it was: the parser already
#       yields 3.3 for that list when the first argument is unbound. Two spellings of one number are one number,
#       and only numeric unification can say so. (INRIA number_chars#309, number_codes#324.)
#   (b) SYNTAX — pl_parse_number() had no 0'c character-code constant, so "0'A" and "0'a" did not parse at all.
#       (INRIA number_chars#314, number_codes#328.)
#
# ⭐ AND ONE DEFECT NO INRIA GOAL COVERS, FOUND BY PROBING PAST THE FAILING WITNESSES AND WORSE THAN BOTH:
# number_codes(X,"0xff") returned 255.0 — a FLOAT. strtoll stopped at the 'x', and strtod then parsed "0xff"
# as a HEX FLOAT, which C99 supports and ISO Prolog does not. A silent WRONG ANSWER sitting on the same line as
# the silent failures, and invisible to the suite that sent me here. It is graded below by TYPE, not just value:
# integer(X) must hold, because 255.0 and 255 both write as a number a careless witness would accept.
#
# ⛔ THE NO-ACCEPT CONTROLS ARE THE POINT. Over-acceptance is the natural failure mode of a number-reader cure —
# a reader that accepts everything passes an accept-only gate perfectly. The reverse direction is graded too
# (number_chars(3.3,L) must still yield ['3','.','3']), because reordering the leaf to try the list first is
# exactly the edit that would break it.
#
# ⛔ ONE FORM IS DELIBERATELY NOT GRADED, BECAUSE THE ORACLES DISAGREE: "0''" (zero, quote, quote) is 39 in
# swipl 9.x and a syntax_error in gprolog 1.4.5, measured 2026-09-06. SCRIP follows swipl. That is a CHOICE and
# it is named here rather than pinned, on the same rule the read/2 gate uses for culprit text: where the two
# oracles disagree the standard is loose, and a gate that pins one vendor's reading manufactures a conformance
# claim. "0'''" (three quotes) IS graded — both oracles answer 39.
