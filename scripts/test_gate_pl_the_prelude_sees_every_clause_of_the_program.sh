# test_gate_pl_the_prelude_sees_every_clause_of_the_program.sh -- the Prolog prelude (PL_PRELUDE_SRC in
# src/parsers/prolog/prolog_parse.c: member/2, append/3, reverse/2, last/2, ...) is injected for every predicate the
# PROGRAM references and the program does not define itself, whatever file of the program the reference or the
# definition sits in and however many clauses precede it (cto 2026-09-27, CTO-188, found by the pl2wam demo row).
#
# WHAT THIS PINS -- TWO DEFECTS OF prolog_inject_prelude, ONE CURE. (1) It decided "referenced" by a word scan of the
# TOP file's text only, so a prelude predicate called only from a file spliced in by :- include(F) was never
# injected: GNU's pl2wam (all.pl includes ten modules) died on existence_error(procedure, member/2). (2) It recorded
# the program's own definitions in user_defined[512][96] -- one row per CLAUSE, not per predicate -- so past clause
# 512 a user's own definition was invisible and the prelude's was appended after it: a program that defines
# reverse/2 after 600 facts answered [mine([a,b]),[b,a]] to findall(R, reverse([a,b], R), L), a second, foreign
# solution. wanted[256] and the per-clause calls[64] were the same fixed-cap shape (RULES.md NO FIXED LIMIT A PROGRAM
# CAN REACH). The cure walks every parsed clause tree (includes are spliced into the program before injection) into
# growable vectors, and keeps the old text scan as a union so nothing injected before is lost.
#
# THE REF IS CUT FROM swipl (a user definition of a library predicate wins there and nothing is appended), and the
# gate re-cuts it when swipl is on the box. GNU Prolog is not the oracle for arm (b): reverse/2 is a GNU built-in and
# GNU refuses the redefinition.
#
# RED BEFORE THE CURE (SCRIP 964982d54 with prolog_parse.c reverted): arm (a) existence_error(procedure,member/2),
# rc=2; arm (b) [mine([a,b]),[b,a]]. GREEN AFTER: both arms byte-identical to the ref in m3 and m4.
