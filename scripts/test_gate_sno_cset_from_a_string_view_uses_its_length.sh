# test_gate_sno_cset_from_a_string_view_uses_its_length.sh -- a cset built from a CAPTURED substring
# contains that substring's characters and no others.
#
# THE DEFECT (row snobol4-gimpel-hyphenat-and-line-error-246-is-a-third-mechanism-not-the-capture-class):
# a SNOBOL4 conditional assignment (`. U`) can bind U to a VIEW -- a pointer plus a length INTO a larger
# string, with no NUL at the end of the view. The pattern builders then flattened that descriptor with
# VARVAL_fn, which returns the bare pointer and IGNORES slen, and pat_mk_cset() took strlen() of it. The
# cset therefore ran past the capture to the end of the enclosing buffer.
#
# ⛔ IT IS A SILENT WRONG ANSWER, WHICH IS WHY IT SURVIVED SO LONG AND WHY THIS GATE IS NOT OPTIONAL.
# Nothing crashed and nothing refused: SIZE(U) read 3, `OUTPUT = U` printed exactly 3 characters, and only
# the CSET was wrong. The two Gimpel programs that exposed it had been attributed to a stack-overflow
# class by two earlier rows and to a capture-over-a-defer class by a third; all three were refuted, and the
# real fault was one flattening call.
#
# THE ARMS, and each one has to be able to go red on its own:
#   1  a cset built from a capture that is FOLLOWED by more text contains only the captured characters
#   2  the SECOND and THIRD such csets are not contaminated either -- the original symptom was cumulative,
#      the first capture picking up every later one, so a single-entry arm would have passed throughout
#   3  the same through a TABLE value, which is the shape the real program used
#   4  a capture at the END of the subject (already NUL-terminated) still works -- the cure must not
#      break the case that was always right
# ⭐ EVERY EXPECTATION IS CUT FROM sbl -bf AT RUN TIME, not pinned from us: the gate runs the oracle on the
# same witness and diffs. A pinned expectation here would have frozen our own wrong answer.
