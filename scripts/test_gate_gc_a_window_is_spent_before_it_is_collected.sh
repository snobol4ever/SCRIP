# test_gate_gc_a_window_is_spent_before_it_is_collected.sh -- THE COLLECTOR SPENDS ITS WINDOW AS SPITBOL SPENDS ITS -i (ceo 2026-09-25,
# CEO-1264; Lon 2026-09-25 10:06, in-chat to the ceo: "continue getting all demos and benchmarks running faster than SPITBOL").
# SPITBOL's alloc (sbl.min aloc1..aloc4) collects only when an allocation does not fit its dynamic area, and grows the area by -i when
# a collection leaves less than e_fsp = 15 percent free. SCRIP collected at HALF its free window and grew only when an allocation
# overran it, so under the demo grid's -d512m -i64m treebank collected once (110 ms) where SPITBOL collected zero times, and a program
# whose live set outgrows the window thrashed. Since this landing the line leaves one sixteenth of the free window as burst room and a
# collection that leaves under 15 percent free grows the window at once (gc_heap.c GC_FREE_PCT).
# THE ORACLE IS SPITBOL's OWN COUNT: sbl -bf -x prints REGENERATIONS; both engines run at their shipped defaults (-i1m for both).
# ARMS: (1) fit.sno -- garbage that fits the window -- collects exactly as often as SPITBOL (0), in m3 and m4; (2) grow.sno -- a live
# set that outgrows the window by seven times -- collects at most twice SPITBOL's count plus two, in m3 and m4; (3) both answer the
# oracle in both modes.
# FAIL_ONCE (recorded): the pre-pacing runtime at d566528fa read fit 1 collection in both modes and grow 100 in m3 and 72 in m4 (SPITBOL 0
# and 10); this tree reads fit 0 and grow 11 in m3 and 10 in m4.
# EXIT 0 all arms; 1 a red (named); 2 REFUSED (the oracle, its count or the build missing).
