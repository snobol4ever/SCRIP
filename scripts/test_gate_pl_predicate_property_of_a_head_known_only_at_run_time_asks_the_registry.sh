# THE ROW: prolog-a-run-time-dynamic-1-records-the-predicate-and-predicate-property-of-a-head-the-compiler-never-saw-asks-the-
# registry (cfo; found by the ceo, CEO-1523). predicate_property/2 written with a constant head is answered by the lowerer
# from what the compiler knows; a head it knows nothing about (a predicate a run-time consult, a run-time dynamic/1 or an
# assertz brings in) compiled to plain failure. It now goes to the run-time enumerator ($pl_pp_count/$pl_pp_nth) the
# variable-head case uses, so the registry answers.
#
# One program x two modes: a file named at run time is consulted (its dynamic directive in canonical form), dynamic/1 is
# called at run time, a predicate is asserted at run time, and each is asked about with a constant head; the answers are
# swipl's. rc=0 clean · rc=1 a divergence · rc=2 REFUSAL.
