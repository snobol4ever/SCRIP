# test_gate_icn_loadfunc_returns_a_callable.sh — loadfunc() RESOLVES A SYMBOL AND RETURNS SOMETHING YOU CAN CALL.
#
# THE DEFECT THIS PINS (hq_S 2026-09-10, row icon-loadfunc-exits-1-with-no-output-master-procedure-write-254,
# CEO-476).  by_name_dispatch.c's loadfunc arm dlopen'd the library, resolved the symbol with dlsym, and then
# set `*out = FAILDESCR` UNCONDITIONALLY — on the success path too.  So loadfunc could never return a callable
# and f(x) could never work.
#
# ⛔⭐ WHY IT NEEDED A GATE OF ITS OWN, AND IT IS THE WHOLE REASON THIS FILE EXISTS: the defect was INVISIBLE.
# No .so in the corpus could be dlopen'd at all (the one master consumer, procedure_write_254, loads the
# COMBINED ipl/cfuncs library, which is a plug-in against the iconx interpreter's own C runtime and needs 12
# symbols iconx exports from its -rdynamic link), so every call site died at ERROR 216 BEFORE reaching the
# stub — and the raise-216 arm is indistinguishable from a working implementation to every test the tree
# owned.  A stub that can only be reached through a door that is always shut reads exactly like a cure.
# This gate opens the door: it BUILDS ITS OWN self-contained .so at run time, so it needs no vendored binary
# and no permission-gated symbol, and it exercises the marshalling surface a real plug-in uses.
#
# THE STANDING NEGATIVE CONTROL IS ARM N and it is load-bearing: a cure that returns a callable must STILL
# raise 216 when dlopen genuinely fails, or `ladder_rung41_rt_loadfunc_refusal` in the Icon master goes red.
#
# EXPECTATIONS ARE PINNED FROM icont/iconx 9.5.25a, cut live 2026-09-10 by hq_S; the gate does not need the
# oracle at run time (it needs gcc and icall.h) and REFUSES rc=2 rather than measuring nothing.
