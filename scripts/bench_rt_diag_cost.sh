# bench_rt_diag_cost.sh -- WHAT THE SHIPPED LIBRARY PAYS FOR ITS DIAGNOSTICS WHILE THEY ARE OFF (ceo CEO-1390, 2026-10-01; the cfo's
# row runtime-the-shipped-library-pays-for-its-diagnostics-while-they-are-off-...). The DONE-WHEN of that row.
#
# THE QUESTION. SCRIP_DIAG=0 turns the runtime's diagnostic switches off, but the code RT_DIAG=1 compiles in still runs: the
# collector's stack-walk census counters (gc_walk_words, gc_walk_interior), gc_nospine_cell, gc_assert_check. Lon's CEO-1262 word,
# "turn off all diagnostic code for benchmarks", is read by CEO-1390 as: the shipped library carries no diagnostic code that costs
# instructions while the diagnostic is off. The bars keep grading the shipped library, which is the point of this arm.
#
# THE ARM. treebank x1024 in mode 4 (-d512m -i1m -s256m, the speed row's own demo and switches), ONE binary run twice: once against
# the shipped out/libscrip_rt.so, once against the same tree built with RT_OPT plus -DRT_DIAG=0. The second is built in THIS
# checkout under its own RT_TAG (out/libscrip_rt-<tag>.so, objects cached under out/rt_pic-<tag>), the way the auditor gate builds
# its knob-on library. It compiles exactly the sources of the shipped one with one define added, so it is "the same tree" and costs
# a scratch worktree nothing: cold about 3.5 min at -j8 on 2026-10-01, cached after.
# Both libraries are READ BACK, never assumed: the shipped one must carry the [ZGC-WALK] telemetry string an RT_DIAG=1 build
# compiles in, and the scouting one must not. Otherwise the arm would compare a build with itself and REFUSES.
# THE COUNT is user-mode retired instructions from perf stat (instructions:u), the hardware Ir. It is load-immune: two runs of one
# library agreed to 0.0003% on 2026-10-01. It is not a wall-clock predictor, and the line says so. callgrind would count the
# same thing at roughly 100x the cost per arm on 5.7e9 instructions.
# Both runs' stdout must be byte-identical and non-empty, or the arm REFUSES: a cost over a wrong answer is not a cost.
#
#   bench_rt_diag_cost.sh [BAR_PCT]   default 2: GREEN while the diagnostics cost at most BAR_PCT percent of the shipped Ir.
# EXIT 0 GREEN, 1 RED (the gap exceeds the bar), 2 REFUSED (no perf, a build failed, a stamp disagrees, the outputs differ).
