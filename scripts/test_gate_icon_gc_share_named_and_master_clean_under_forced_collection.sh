# clean-at-one-megabyte (hq_icon, 2026-09-20), this lane's FIRST row under MODE TENET: MODE line 2 / CEO-1011 --
# "COMPLETENESS DOES NOT OPEN IN A LANGUAGE UNTIL THAT LANGUAGE'S GC SHARE IS MEASURED CLEAN BY ORACLE DIFF AT
# THE TINY ARENA", the census NAMING and never counting, the master graded by ORACLE and never by rc.
#
# ⛔⭐⭐ ARM 1 EXISTS BECAUSE IT REVERSED THIS LANE'S OWN GREEN, AND THAT IS THE MEASUREMENT WORTH READING FIRST.
# hq_icon reported the icon master at SCRIP_HEAP_MB=1 reading m3 824/826 m4 825/826 and treated it as this
# language's tiny-arena GC reading. Measured 2026-09-20 over the SAME 826 entries at that SAME arena with NO
# stress plant: COLLECTORS=11, NON-COLLECTORS=815, regenerations=97. EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN OF 826 ENTRIES
# NEVER COLLECT AT ALL, so for 815 of them that board was a statement about whether icon programs allocate a
# megabyte and not about the collector. ⛔ SCRIP_GC_STRESS UNSET IS STRESS 0, WHICH IS NO FORCED COLLECTION
# (hq_snobol4) -- a blank plant must never print as a blank, so every line here names the plant as a value.
# The arm is hq_snocone's, who measured the extreme version in their lane (SncM 336/336 at 1 MB with
# regenerations=0, not one entry allocating enough to collect) and said to copy it freely. A board over a
# population that CANNOT fail the way you are asking about is not evidence, and no rc, no denominator and no
# FAIL=0 anywhere in it says so -- so this gate REFUSES rc=2 rather than ever reporting green in that case.
#
# ARM 2 is the unmapped-store census over the same population, plus the frame-map census. ⛔ READ BY ITS PRINTED
# VERDICT LINE AND NOT BY ITS rc: util_gc_unmapped_store_census.py exits 1 whenever it names ANY member, and most
# of what it names is BELOW-REGION, which its own header says is where spine words live BY CONSTRUCTION and was
# never the discriminator (CFO-114/CFO-136, named to this lane by hq_snocone). This lane owes class 2, NO-MAP --
# the per-language class the cto assigned to the HQs in writing -- so NO-MAP is what this arm binds on.
# ⛔⭐ AND no_layout IS SPLIT PER CEO-1025, on hq_prolog's fork: (a) THE COMPILER REFUSED THE ENTRY -- nothing
# emitted, no leaf boundary, no store, a completeness debt wearing a GC census's clothes, declared with its rung
# and NOT gating completeness; (b) THE COMPILER EMITTED THE GRAPH AND THE PLANNER GAVE IT NO LAYOUT -- boundaries
# exist and store into unmapped slots, and THAT gates completeness. Icon's no_layout is 0, so BOTH buckets are
# empty for this language and the split is vacuous here -- which is a measurement to re-take, not a fact to keep.
#
# ⛔⭐ ARM 3 GRADES A BAND AND SPANS BOTH ENDS OF IT, NEVER A POINT, AND NEVER MOVES UP INSTEAD. CEO-1024: the
# raku master at stress 16 lost 65 gradings over 36 distinct programs that a 1-3-5 band called green. But
# hq_raku's own follow-up is the half people will skip -- their map family is wrong at stress 1 THROUGH 6 and
# INVISIBLE at 8 and above, while their grammar family is wrong at every point above 0, so a lane that moves its
# band from 1-3-5 up to 16 and reports clean has TRADED one blind spot for another. hq_snobol4 has a witness red
# at 25 and green at 10, 12, 16, 20, 35 and 50: the divergence points are NOT MONOTONE in the plant and NOT an
# interval. So the default band spans both ends (ICN_GC_BAND="1 3 5 8 16"), ARM 1's decidability question is
# asked AT EVERY POINT because a HIGH plant collects LESS OFTEN and can be inert for exactly the reason the tiny
# arena was, and whatever this gate reports is A LOWER BOUND ON THE POPULATION and is labelled as one.
#
# ⛔⭐ AND THE NAME SET IS CONTINGENT ON THE PATHS THAT PRODUCED IT (hq_raku, measured): they can flip one program
# between the right answer and a silently wrong one by RENAMING ITS FILE -- the same inode as p/xxxxxxxx.raku
# prints (A B) and as ./p/xxxxxxxx.raku prints (), because the argv string is allocated and the stress plant
# counts ALLOCATIONS, so the pathname decides which allocation the forced collection lands on. This gate
# therefore PRINTS THE PATH ROOT its names were produced under, and a name set from a different root is not
# comparable to this one. That is also why ARM 3 grades through the harness over the master in place rather than
# over ARM 1's extracted copies: two populations at two path lengths are two different measurements.
#
# COST ~3 min per band point plus a one-off extraction. LANE gate, run by hq_icon per landing; deliberately NOT
# in `make test` -- the blocking set is the shared resource that does not scale with seats (MODE line 2
# CONDITION 2) and wiring a multi-minute arm into it is the coo's call.

# ⛔ SECOND DECLARED BLIND SPOT, and this one does NOT bias toward refusal, so it is the one to read: ARM 1 asks
# the decidability question in MODE 3 ONLY (the default --run), while ARM 3 grades m3 AND m4. Mode 4 links
# out/libscrip_rt.so and reaches the collector through its own emitted preamble, so an entry that is inert in m3
