# applied; coo 2026-09-25, row instruments-the-arizona-jcon-and-gimpel-runners-grade-a-library-through-its-driver-...). A library is
# the program and NAME_driver is its grading vehicle, never a program in the shipped population. So a package runner (a) excludes
# every *_driver file from the shipped count by name, and (b) grades the library by its driver -- the library's verdict in each mode
# is the driver's, recorded under the LIBRARY's name in the progress database. A library with no driver stays in the denominator as
# owed, a non-pass, named.
#
# ONE SCRATCH PACKAGE PER RUNNER, three libraries each: one with a passing driver, one with a failing driver and one with none. Each
# must read shipped 3, graded 2, pass 1, with the failing library and the driverless one NAMED. Its inventory must sum (the
# driverless library declared UNGRADED NEEDS_DRIVER), and its progress rows must be keyed by the libraries and never by a driver.

# THE REFS ARE CUT LIVE FROM THE ORACLE (icont/iconx for Icon, sbl -bf for SNOBOL4) for the passing drivers. The failing driver's ref is
# deliberately wrong: 5 where the oracle prints 4. The Icon runners grade against the ref alone, so that driver is a FAIL. gimpel's
# scorecard also compares against the LIVE oracle, and SCRIP agrees with it, so its failing driver also reads &VERSION. SPITBOL refuses
# that (ERROR 251), the scorecard grades the driver against its pin alone, and the wrong pin reads FAIL whatever SCRIP answers.
# NOTHING LIVE IS TOUCHED: S4E_PROGRESS_DB is a scratch table per runner, S4E_SCORE_NO_WRITE shuts the leaderboard write, every
# package lives under mktemp.
