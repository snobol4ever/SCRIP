# test_gate_sno_a_real_that_overflows_is_not_a_value.sh -- a decimal that will not fit a double FAILS to
# convert; it does not become the IEEE infinity and travel on as an ordinary value.
#
# ⛔ THE DEFECT (ceo 2026-09-14, x64 math_limits2/3). SNOBOL4 HAS NO INFINITY. Every arithmetic overflow path
# already raises through rt_real_overflow -- 261/262/263/264 -- but the CONVERSION path had no such check:
# "string to real" was spelled at eight strtod sites across keywords.c, core.c, by_name_dispatch.c,
# icn_extfn.c and arithmetic.c, and not one asked whether a finite decimal had produced a non-finite double.
# `EVAL('1.797693135E+308')` and `CONVERT('1.797693135E+308','REAL')` both handed back `inf`.
#
# ⭐ THE CURE IS ONE AUTHORITY, WHICH IS WHY THIS GATE TESTS THREE DOORS: rt_str_to_real is now the single
# converter that answers finite-or-fails, and EVAL, CONVERT and the dispatcher's own CONVERT fast path all go
# through it. The same defect reached the same program through different doors this morning -- the coercion
# fix -- and a gate holding one door would have let the next one keep its own spelling.
#
# ⛔ NOT A ROUNDING GATE, AND THE DISTINCTION IS LOAD-BEARING: the boundary VALUES here are the ones CPython's
# correctly-rounded strtod agrees with, and at the denormal edge our boundary and the ORACLE's differ because
# SPITBOL's own converter is imprecise there (FINDING-2026-09-14-ceo-the-math-limits-family...). This gate
# asserts only what is not in dispute: a decimal beyond the double range does not become a value.
#
# rc=0 clean · rc=1 an infinity leaked into the value space · rc=2 REFUSAL (cannot measure).
