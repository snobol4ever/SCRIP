# util_zsm_beta_skew_census.sh — THE β-SKEW EXCEPTIONS LIST (s196, Lon P2 directive).
#
# Lon (in-chat s196): "maybe a report at BETA that RSP is different than at ALPHA since most
# boxes require that.  ARBNO is an exception, and I'm curious to have a list of all the
# exceptions."  This census MEASURES that list instead of asserting it: it runs a witness set
# under the full ZSM (SCRIP_ZSM=1 SCRIP_ZSM_ALL=1 SCRIP_ZSM_BSKEW=1), collects every
# [ZSM-BSKEW] line (a β arrival whose rsp differs from the same node's α rsp), and aggregates
# per IR op: which box kinds legitimately resume at a different depth than they were entered.
#
#   bash scripts/util_zsm_beta_skew_census.sh [file.sno ...]     # default: ptc grid + retry family
#
# Read the table as CANDIDATES: a kind appearing here is either a documented exception
# (ARBNO-family per-iteration frames, DEFER blob records) or a defect — the per-op rollup is
# what makes the difference visible.  A program whose VERDICT changes under the instrument
# must not be quoted (s184 proved ZSM-ALL transparent; re-prove after instrument edits).
