# scripts/util_census_dead_pinned_refs.sh — censuses PINS (.ref/.std/ALL.ref) whose OWN CONTENT is a
# transcript of the ORACLE'S DEATH: SPITBOL's fatal termination report, ending in its allocator counters
# `memory used (bytes)` / `memory left (bytes)`.  Row: the ceo's HOLD dispatch to hq_B, 2026-09-08 —
# "have it ready to re-run and report the before-and-after", the honest measure of hq_R's termination-report
# landing.  Reports; changes nothing.  Deleting a pin is a SEPARATE, HELD decision (ceo: removing programs
# from a denominator is the hardest edit on the board to undo).
#
# ⛔⭐ WHY A PIN LIKE THIS IS NOT A BUG WE CAN CURE.  The premise of a package board is "the oracle runs this
# clean and we do not".  For these entries the premise is INVERTED: the oracle DIES and the ref pins the
# death, so we are graded against a transcript of SPITBOL's own failure.  Six of the report's eight lines we
# can produce honestly (g_file g_line g_stno g_stcount + a clock); the two MEMORY counters are SPITBOL's own
# allocator and no other implementation can produce them by being correct, only by transcribing.  So a
# correct cure on such a program cannot flip it — hq_R proved that the expensive way on `rewind1`: a real
# defect (ERROR 174 on REWIND with no OPENed file), properly cured and landed, and THE BOARD DID NOT MOVE.
#
# ⛔⭐⭐ TWO INSTRUMENT LAWS ARE BUILT IN, BOTH LEARNED BY THIS CENSUS FAILING THEM FIRST.
# (1) ZERO-FOUND AND ZERO-EXAMINED PRINT IDENTICALLY.  The first sweep suppressed directories with no pins,
#     so `snoflake 0 / dotnet 0 / testpgms 0` READ AS CLEAN when it meant NOT LOOKED AT — those three suites
#     have no per-program pins at all, they grade live against the oracle.  Every directory is therefore
#     printed with its POPULATION, and a population of zero is spelled NO-PINS, never 0-dead.  A census that
#     cannot see its population must never print 0.
# (2) ⛔ MEASURE A PREDICATE WITH THE INTERPRETER THAT WILL RUN IT.  `corpus/tests/snobol4/ALL.ref` — the
#     SNOBOL4 MASTER, the announcement board — carries ONE NUL byte in 330570, so `file` calls it "data".
#     ⛔ AN EARLIER VERSION OF THIS HEADER SAID THAT BYTE *HID* THREE DEAD-PINNED MASTER ENTRIES behind a grep
#     that reports nothing and exits 0.  THAT WAS WRONG, and hq_T bounded it 2026-09-08.  The interactive shell
#     on this box routes `grep` to a ugrep FUNCTION; it is NOT exported (no BASH_FUNC_grep), so it never reaches
#     a script.  Inside a script — the only place `sbl_died` ever runs — grep is /usr/bin/grep GNU 3.11, whose
#     binary detection suppresses OUTPUT but never EXIT STATUS, and -q prints nothing anyway.  RE-MEASURED HERE
#     on the real master, in a script: no -a => DEAD, with -a => DEAD.  The predicate has ALWAYS answered DEAD
#     everywhere it actually runs; nothing was concealed and no board number was ever hidden.  The three entries
#     are genuinely dead-pinned — that half of the finding stands — but the NUL byte is not why they went unseen.
#     ⭐ THE KEEPER: `command -v grep` printed a bare "grep" and could not say so; `type -t` is the instrument
#     that answers WHICH grep.  A shell function shadowing a binary survives no export and silently answers a
#     different question than the same text in a script.
#     `-a` stays on every match here, and hq_T landed it on the authority too (SCRIP 60d58c05b), as INSURANCE
#     rather than a repair: it makes the answer independent of whatever grep is on PATH, at zero verdict cost.
#     The check below therefore guards ONE thing only — that the two spellings do not drift apart.
#     ⛔ AND QUOTE THAT WEAKER GUARANTEE, NOT THE OLD ONE (hq_T, 2026-09-08): a DRIFT guard greens whenever
#     the two spellings AGREE, and they will keep agreeing while both are wrong in the same way.  It can tell
#     you the predicate HAS NOT CHANGED; it can never tell you the predicate is RIGHT.  The old sentence
#     claimed the stronger thing, and the stronger thing is what a hurried reader remembers.
#
# (3) ⭐ --behind: A DEAD PIN DOES NOT MERELY MISCLASSIFY, IT CONCEALS (ceo CEO-427, 2026-09-08).  Because the
#     ref pins a transcript of SPITBOL dying, the suite never compares SCRIP's real output to anything -- it
#     sees a mismatch, writes FAIL, and nobody asks what our output WAS.  The ceo found three programs that
#     ABORT behind their dead pins, one cause, invisible for as long as the pins existed.  `--behind` runs
#     SCRIP on each dead-pinned program and reports WHAT THE PIN WAS HIDING: CRASH / TIMEOUT / rc + line count.
#     ⛔ IT FEEDS STDIN THROUGH split_at_end, THE SUITE'S OWN CONVENTION (stdin follows the END statement in
#     the same file).  A </dev/null run here would print a clean-looking table from a STARVED program -- the
#     trap that took hq_P, the cto and the ceo in one night, the last of them while actively looking for it.
#
# Exit: 0 = censused (any count; a report is not a verdict).  2 = REFUSED, could not measure.
