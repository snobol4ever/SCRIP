# ⭐ WITNESS GATE for row snobol4-trace-of-an-array-or-table-element-never-registers-because-a-name-of-element-
# carries-no-spelling (cfo 2026-09-13), the blocker of ladder rung23.  TRACE(.A[2]) and TRACE(.T['k'],'VALUE')
# never fired in either mode: the oracle prints a banner in a spelling the plain-variable banner never uses --
# ANGLE BRACKETS, A<2> and T<'k'> -- and SCRIP printed neither.  Every expectation below is cut from `sbl -bf`
# at run time and never typed.
# ⛔ THE ROW'S OWN DIAGNOSIS SAID THE SPELLING MUST BE CAPTURED WHERE THE NAME-OF IS FORMED.  MEASURED, THE
# ORACLE DOES NOT DO THAT, AND ARM 'alias' IS THAT MEASUREMENT KEPT AS A GATE: trace .B[2] where B = A and the
# banner still reads A<2>, so SPITBOL spells the element by REVERSE-LOOKING-UP THE CONTAINER in its variable
# table at print time, not by remembering the source text.  A cure that captured the source spelling would be
# green on the rung and wrong here.
# ⛔ ARM 'rebind' IS THE IDENTITY ARM AND IT IS WHY THE REGISTRY CARRIES THE CONTAINER'S SERIAL: the spelling
# alone is not an identity.  Rebind A to a NEW array and the oracle goes SILENT -- a name-of binds to the CELL
# -- while a cure keyed on the string "A<2>" alone happily traces the new array's cell.  It scored exactly that
# before the eid check went in.
# ⛔ ARM 'stoptr' IS NOT DECORATION EITHER: STOPTR reaches the same spelling through the same path, and it was
# RED for a reason worth keeping -- VARVAL_fn on a NAMETRAP does NOT return the empty string, it returns THE
# CELL'S VALUE, so the element branch was skipped for every cell that had already been written to.
# ⭐ SCOPE, said rather than implied: these arms are ONE-DIMENSIONAL.  A 2-D element trace (the manual's own
# TRACE(.A[2,5]) form) is measured RED and rowed separately -- _TRACE_ is not even entered for it.
