# ⭐ RUNG 3, STEP (f), OF frame-slot-reuse-a-live-range-in-a-byrd-graph-extends-to-every-point-reachable-by-recession
# (cto, CEO-684 slice 2): A FIRST-OCCURRENCE BARE HEAD VARIABLE IS ITS PARAM SLOT.  r(N) :- ... used to lower the
# head argument N as a local G0 unified with the param A0 at clause entry ($unify(VAR_REF A0, VAR_REF G0)) and then
# read G0; the param slot already holds exactly what G0 would (a bound argument by value, an unbound one as a
# reference to the caller's cell -- which is why s(Z) binds the caller's Z through it), so the lowerer
# (lower_prolog.c, the clause loop) names the variable A<i> for the whole clause, builds no unify for that argument,
# and the graph's local table keeps only the slots some node still names.  The criterion is BARE ARGUMENT AT ITS
# FIRST OCCURRENCE: a variable inside a compound argument keeps its local, a repeated bare variable keeps one
# equality unify (only the position the alias names skips its unify), an anonymous _ has its own slot.
# ⛔ THE SILENT-WRONG-ANSWER SHAPE, PROVEN FAIL-ONCE BEFORE THE LANDING: with the bare-argument criterion ablated (every
# head variable aliased, compounds included) v(f(X), X) read X as the whole first argument -- v(f(c), c) printed v_bad,
# k(f(X)) :- X = z printed k2_bad, and the recursive m(f(X)) :- m(X) HUNG (rc=124) -- while the same binary still
# printed every other line right.  Ablating the first-occurrence check or the local-table scan produced NO failure on
# these witnesses (a bare repeat always keeps one unify by construction; slot numbers never repeat across a
# predicate's clauses), so those two are recorded as conservative, not load-bearing.
# ⛔ THE CLAIM IS HELD BY INSTRUMENTS, NOT BY MEMORY: (1) r/1 < 200 (the ROW's DONE-WHEN; 208 on the rung-3(d) tree)
# with vslots=3 and no G0 in its vslot table; (2) util_frame_refs_land_in_grants.py finds 0 unlanded references over
# the prelude; (3) answers both modes: the head-alias witness (scripts/fixtures/frame_head_alias_witness.pl, 23 lines,
# ref cut from swipl: backtracking rebinding, bare repeat, anonymous pair, compound-first, three-way repeat, binding
# through the caller, the r/1 recursion, the two-clause k/1, the recursive m/1), the r/1 witness, the rung-3(d) guard
# witness, Icon and SNOBOL4.
# ⛔ THE SECOND FAIL-ONCE, A LATENT SPINE DEFECT THE ALIAS EXPOSED (rt.c rt_pl_tail_args_safe, the LCO admission test):
# b(X) :- c(X) printed b(_G0) with the alias landed and the test uncured -- the staged argument (a name-pointer to the
# param, whose chain reaches main's UNBOUND cell) was classified a scalar and forwarded BY VALUE, severing the caller's
# variable; before the alias the head-unified local held a Prolog reference the probe does not follow, so the chain
# stopped inside the frame and LCO was refused (gdb: base returned 0, head returned 1 with g_call_args[0] replaced).
# The cure: an unbound cell reached through name-pointers is a VARIABLE -- the forwarded argument is a reference to
# it when the cell survives the frame, and LCO is REFUSED when the cell lies inside the dying frame.  Twelve Prolog
# benchmark kernels (fib, nrev, tak, zebra ...) answered wrong or hung between the two; all twelve agree with base after.
# RED-BEFORE on the rung-3(d) tree 987a8ea74: r/1 208, vslots=4 (G0 present), rc=1.
# ⛔ REFUSES rc=2 when --dump-zeta yields no r/1 graph.
