# test_gate_sno_lastno_across_call_return.sh -- &LASTNO (backed by g_stno) is never saved/restored across a
# CALL/RETURN boundary in any calling convention. Real SPITBOL semantics: after a call returns, &LASTNO reads
# the CALLER's own last-executed statement number, not the callee's. rt_stmt_enter (src/runtime/keywords.c)
# fires only at a textual statement boundary; nothing saves or restores g_stno at a call boundary.
#
# Row: gstno-lastno-not-restored-across-call-return-boundary (hq_U). Witness minted and oracle-verified by
# seat11 2026-09-05; this gate is the runnable criterion for it (the row was minted with the placeholder
# DONE-WHEN and was therefore UNPICKABLE -- ceo census 19:02).
#
# ⛔ GENERAL AND TRACE-INDEPENDENT: the witness below uses no TRACE at all. A cure that only fixes the SIG
# shim (bb_define_sr) and not the other conventions (bb_call_proc_staged ab3b_z/fn_cell and the generic-slim
# fallbacks, bb_define_activate/bb_define_bind, xa_flat CLASS-C) leaves the class open -- NO PER-OP FILTER.
#
# Graded in BOTH modes against /home/resources/x64/bin/sbl -bf. rc=0 both modes match the oracle, rc=1 either
# diverges, rc=2 could not measure (no oracle, no binary, build/link failure, zero programs graded).
