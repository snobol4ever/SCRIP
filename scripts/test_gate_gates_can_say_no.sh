# test_gate_gates_can_say_no.sh -- V2-5.  THE GATE THAT TESTS THE GATES.
#
# ONE QUESTION, ASKED OF EVERY GATE: given NOTHING to examine, does it refuse -- or does it say green?
# A gate handed an empty tree has proven nothing.  If it exits 0 anyway, every DONE-WHEN that cites it is
# closing rows on a lie (ARCH-FLEET-CEO.md LAW 1).  seat16's audit found 31 such gates by hand-injection;
# this runs the same injection mechanically, every time, so gate #32 cannot reintroduce the hole.
#
# THE INJECTION is deliberately the crudest possible one: a scratch sibling root holding the gate script and
# NOTHING ELSE -- no scrip binary, no out/libscrip_rt.so, empty src/, empty corpus/.  Both $HERE/.. and
# $S4E_HOME resolve into the scratch root, so the gate genuinely cannot see the real tree.  Any gate that
# returns 0 from that state is, by construction, not reading what it claims to read.
#
# EXPECTED verdicts are pinned per script, so this gate can say no in BOTH directions:
#   REFUSE  -- must exit non-zero on the empty tree (the honest answer).
#   PASSES  -- known-still-vacuous, pinned with its audit tier.  A PASSES entry that starts REFUSING is a
#              WIN and is reported as a FIXED row -- update the pin.  This is the ratchet.

# ⛔⭐ SEAT10'S LIST, PINNED AT LAST (coo 2026-09-18, on the cto's CTO-74).  seat16's 31 above were cured by hq_P
# and pinned here, which is why they have held.  seat10 then audited the scripts that pin never covered and named
# about 23 more on 2026-08-23 -- AND THAT SECOND LIST WAS NEVER PINNED, and the file naming it was deleted three
# weeks later.  The cto recovered it from .github history and re-measured at HEAD with this gate's own injection:
# examined 23, REFUSED 13, VACUOUS 10.  The ten are cured and pinned here, so the hole cannot reopen silently.
# ⛔ TWO OF THEM WERE NOT MERELY VACUOUS.  test_gate_ir_field_discipline, test_gate_sm_dead and
# test_gate_icn_one_reg_frame are RATCHETS: a vacuous hard-zero gate lies about a measurement, but a vacuous
# ratchet reads as a WIN AGAINST ITS TARGET and then prints an instruction to tighten it -- so acting on the
# gate's own printed advice would entrench a false target permanently, and it would be a careful seat following
# the instrument that did it.  Their cure refuses BEFORE the comparison, never after.

# ⛔⭐⭐ THE CANARY: PROVE THE DETECTOR STILL DETECTS (coo 2026-09-18, on the cto's warning, which they earned the
# hard way -- they widened the digest gate's FINDING arm after it reported PASS over 50 digests while five still
# asserted the retired prohibition verbatim, because its canary matched and the gate self-certified a tree it had
# not read).  THE HAZARD HERE IS EXACT: this gate's verdict is "every pinned script REFUSED", and a script can
# refuse for reasons that have nothing to do with honesty -- a missing lib_gate.sh, a bad copy, a timeout, a
# scratch root that stopped being empty.  If the INJECTION itself broke, every entry would REFUSE, VACUOUS would
# read 0, and this gate would report a perfect green while testing nothing at all.  That is the precise failure
# this whole file exists to catch, one level up, and a pinned list that grows without its canary growing is a
# ratchet with a blind spot of exactly its own shape.
# ⭐ SO A KNOWN-VACUOUS SCRIPT IS PLANTED AND MUST BE CAUGHT.  It exits 0 unconditionally, so if the machinery is
# working it is detected as VACUOUS; if it is NOT detected, the detector is broken and this gate REFUSES rc=2
# rather than reporting on the pinned list it can no longer judge.  The canary is NOT counted in the population.
