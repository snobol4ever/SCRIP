# test_gate_score_row_write_names_the_lane_owner_from_mode.sh -- THE SCORE-ROW WRITE PATH READS MODE's LANES: LINE, NAMES THE
# ADMITTED SEAT FOR THE BOARD'S LANGUAGE, AND REFUSES ANY OTHER SEAT BY NAME (coo 2026-09-16; ceo CEO-786; hq_snobol4's
# finding; row instruments-every-board-write-prints-one-runner-not-determined-under-no-central-runner-read-the-lanes-line).
#
# THE DEFECT: under CEO-775 (no central runner) util_score_row.py looked only for THE ONE RUNNER on MODE line 2, found none,
# printed "ONE RUNNER NOT DETERMINED ... If you are not the one runner, this row is yours to discard" to the seat that OWNS
# the row, and wrote -- while lib_one_runner.sh already admitted exactly the LANES: seat for the board's language.
#
# THE CURE UNDER TEST: lane_writer_seat(lang) reads the LANES: line the shell guard reads; one_runner_declines prints the
# admitted seat when the measurer is it, REFUSES by name (rc=0, non-fatal, byte-unchanged) when it is not, keeps the two doors (the bus's
# computed done run; a loud S4E_SCORE_WRITE -- ⛔ NOT S4E_ONE_RUNNER_OVERRIDE, which admits the board RUN and says nothing
# about publication since ceo CEO-961, 2026-09-20), and falls back to THE ONE RUNNER clause only when no LANES: line
# answers; the stale sentence is gone from the file.
#
# ARMS (a scratch .github that LOOKS like the shared board -- a git clone with an origin url -- because a plain scratch
# copy is exempt by design; a scratch MODE through S4E_MODE_FILE; the live .github is never touched):
#   (a) measurer = the LANES: owner writes its own language's board row: the write lands and names the lane owner
#   (b) measurer = another seat: REFUSED by name (both seats), SCORE.md byte-identical, NON-FATAL rc=0 (the standing ruling of test_gate_score_row_only_the_one_runner_writes.sh: a bookkeeping refusal never reds a measured board)
#   (c) S4E_ONE_RUNNER_OVERRIDE="why" does NOT open this door and says so by name (ceo CEO-961: it admits the RUN; a
#       control arm publishes nothing by default), and (c2) S4E_SCORE_WRITE="why" opens it loudly for that other seat
#   (d) no LANES: line and no ONE RUNNER clause: the honest fallback writes and says LANE OWNER NOT DETERMINED
#   (e) the stale sentence is absent from util_score_row.py and every lib_*.sh
# FAIL_ONCE=1 swaps arm (b)'s measurer for the lane owner so the expected refusal never comes, proving the arm trips.
