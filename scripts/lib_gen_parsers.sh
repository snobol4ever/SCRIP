# lib_gen_parsers.sh -- THE ONE TABLE OF GRAMMAR GENERATION INVOCATIONS, shared by the regenerator and the gate that grades it.
# Extracted 2026-09-04 (hq_T, row parser-sources-and-generated-files-in-sync-gate-in-make-test) from
# regenerate_parser_and_lexer_from_sources.sh, which held the only copy. Consumers: that script, and
# test_gate_parser_generated_files_in_sync.sh.
# ⛔ WHY THIS IS A SHARED BODY AND NOT A SECOND COPY IN THE GATE. The gate's whole claim is "the committed output matches what the
# pinned tools produce from the source". A gate carrying its OWN copy of the invocations grades the source against the GATE'S idea of
# the flags, not the regenerator's -- so the day someone adds a sixth grammar, or changes raku's `--warnings=none`, the two tables
# disagree and the gate is either falsely red or (worse) silently not grading a grammar at all. One table, two readers, no drift.
# Same ruling, and the same reasoning, as lib_ladder.sh and lib_port_trace.sh.
# ⛔ THE FLAGS ARE LOAD-BEARING AND ARE NOT STYLE. Each row generates from INSIDE its own parser directory with the output's BARE
# basename, because bison bakes the input path into #line and the output basename into an #include and an include guard -- generating
# from anywhere else rewrites every committed file with pure path noise (GOAL-STYLE-200COL R4 measured it: 10 files, 4 non-#line
# lines). `flex --noline` is what keeps the lexer outputs path-free entirely. Change a flag here and the committed outputs must be
# regenerated in the same commit.
# ⛔ THE OUTPUT NAMES ARE NOT DERIVABLE FROM THE SOURCE NAMES -- rebus.l produces `lex.rebus.c`, not `rebus.lex.c`, while every other
# lexer takes the `<name>.lex.c` form. A consumer that computes the twin from the source name instead of reading it from this table
# grades eight of nine grammars and reports the ninth as absent, which reads exactly like a clean census.
# The Snocone lexer is a hand-written FSM (snocone_lex.c) and has no .l; Icon and Prolog are hand-written recursive-descent parsers
# with no grammar at all, which is why this table has five parser dirs and not seven.
GEN_BISON_PIN=3.8.2

# gen_parsers_table -- one row per generation step: <parser-dir> TAB <source basename> TAB <primary output basename> TAB <command>.
# The command is run with the parser directory as cwd. A bison row with -d also produces the matching .tab.h; consumers discover that
# by looking at what the run actually produced rather than by predicting it here.
