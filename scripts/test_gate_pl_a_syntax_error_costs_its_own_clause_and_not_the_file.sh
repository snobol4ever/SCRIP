# ONE MALFORMED CLAUSE MUST COST ITS OWN CLAUSE AND NOTHING ELSE (cto 2026-09-13, routed from the coo's
# prolog group board 62bad32d9). The swi suite lost 82 cases to hq_C's quoted-token tightening 077a4e9dd, and
# the SHAPE of the loss is what this gate is about: test_yall 0 of 42, test_syntax 0 of 38, test_answer 0 of
# 14, queue_gc 0 of 8 -- four WHOLE FILES, not eighty-one cases that use the construct. One offending token
# anywhere in a file aborts the file, so the other forty-one cases in it are never read, never run, and never
# counted. THE TIGHTENING WAS RIGHT AND ITS BLAST RADIUS IS THE DEFECT: until a syntax error is local, the
# cost of every correct lexer tightening is measured in whole files, which is an argument against making the
# reader more correct.
#
# ⭐ THE ORACLE IS THE DISCRIMINATOR AND IT IS NOT CLOSE. On the identical four-clause witness, swipl -q
# prints ONE syntax error naming line 2 and then answers p(one) / q(two) / r(three); we print THREE parse
# errors -- one real and two cascaded from a reader that never resynchronised -- and answer nothing at all,
# because the file is abandoned before any clause reaches the database.
#
# ⛔ THE m4 ARM DELETES ITS OWN ARTIFACTS BEFORE EACH COMPILE, AND THAT IS NOT HYGIENE, IT IS THE VERDICT.
# Without the rm, a subject compile that REFUSES leaves the CONTROL arm's .s and binary in place, the gate
# links and runs those instead, and the subject arm reports three answers from a program it never built --
# which is exactly what this gate did on its first red run, reading m4 answers=3 for a tree where mode 4
# produced nothing at all. A stale artifact under a refusing compile is indistinguishable from success.
#
# ⛔ WHAT IS COUNTED IS THE PER-SITE DIAGNOSTIC -- a line carrying a source line number and `parse error` or
# `lex error` -- and NOT the driver's one-line summary of how many there were. Counting both was this gate's
# own first reading and it made a correct cure read as 2 want 1. In mode 4 the diagnostics are emitted at
# COMPILE time and the answers at RUN time, so the arm grades the compile log and the program output
# CONCATENATED; grading only what the binary printed made the m4 subject arm read 0 diagnostics for a file
# that had just reported one -- the same instrument failure from the opposite side.
#
# ⛔ THE ERROR COUNT IS GRADED, NOT JUST THE ANSWERS, and that is deliberate: a reader could be made to
# limp to the end of the file while emitting a cascade of invented errors, which would answer all three and
# still leave every diagnostic after the first one useless. One bad clause, one diagnostic, naming its line.
# THE CONTROL ARM IS A CLEAN FILE that must load with ZERO diagnostics and all three answers -- if it ever
# goes quiet, the subject arm proves nothing, since a reader that reports nothing and runs nothing would
# otherwise look like progress.
