# test_gate_gc_the_pending_prolog_ball_is_a_rooted_cell.sh -- the Prolog ball in flight from throw to catch lived in a
# CALLEE-SAVED REGISTER, and a register is invisible to every root walk, so the collector reclaimed the ball and the
# structured catcher stopped catching (cfo CFO-119, 2026-09-20; escalated and independently diagnosed by hq_prolog, who
# released the claim rather than build it, because the shape choice was an officer's and the storage needed a ruling).
#
# MEASURED, seven-line witness, a catch whose catcher is the structured term error(type_error(evaluable, foo/0), _):
# swipl and SCRIP at stress 0 print caught_type_error; SCRIP under collection printed NOTHING on stdout and one stderr
# line naming the ball as an UNBOUND VARIABLE, so it no longer unified with the catcher, catch/3 did not catch, and the
# process EXITED 0 WITH THE WRONG STDOUT -- invisible to every rc-shaped instrument. Ragged and NOT a threshold:
# 46 of 68 arms red (17 stress points 0..50 x 2 modes x arenas 1 and 512 MB), green at 0/20/40/50, and m3 and m4
# DISAGREE at 25, 30 and 35 -- the same program, the same stress point, a different answer per mode.
#
# THE MECHANISM, PRINTED IN gdb BOTH WAYS RATHER THAN ARGUED. Ball built at 0x7ffeece13630, header size=32 type=214
# (HB_DVEC), valid at the first collection; on the PRE-CURE binary the header at that address read size=3688618971
# type=56283 at the SECOND collection -- the block was gone and its space re-carved -- while r15 still held the old
# address. CURED, the same probe prints slot=0x7ffeece135f0 against r15=0x7ffeece13630 at that same collection: the
# block SURVIVES and the collector FORWARDED it 0x40 bytes. So the VALUE READS MUST TAKE THE SLOT: a mirror that kept
# reading r15 would still have taken the stale address. gc_type_moves(HB_DVEC) is 1; the ball moves; a register cannot
# be told.
#
# ⛔ THE HOME IS THE TRAIL, NOT A GLOBAL, AND THAT IS THE LAW AND NOT A PREFERENCE. RULES.md line 231 forbids a new
# global without Lon's in-chat grant that session, and scripts/test_gate_pl_no_new_global.sh prints the sanctioned
# alternative in its own refusal text: put the state in a FRAME CELL or the TRAIL. The trail arena is Prolog's ONE
# runtime spine, it is seeded once by the root graph and is live for the rest of the run (xa_flat.cpp guards the seed on
# root_graph), its 32-byte header already exists with only word 0 in use, and it is ALREADY registered with the collector
# as a topword root range. So the pending ball lives at PL_TR_BALL_OFF in that header, reached through r12, and the
# range walk visits it. A first cure held it in a new hidden global and measured IDENTICALLY (68 arms, 0 red, the same
# 0x40 forward) -- it was discarded for the storage, not the mechanism.
# ⛔ AND IT IS A ROOT, NEVER AN INVALIDATION (hq_snobol4 via hq_prolog): a later read must return the SAME ball because
# a handler matches its shape, so a generation-checked cache here would only convert garbage into a silent forget.
#
# Arms: (1) BEHAVIOUR -- the witness answers its oracle in BOTH modes across a 16-point band (CEO-1024: never {0,1,3,5}).
#           THIS IS ALSO THE INERTNESS DETECTOR: hq_snobol4 landed this same class with the visit behind an early return,
#           measured the whole band byte-identical to base, and an inert cure reads as "I rooted it and nothing moved".
#       (2) LOCKSTEP -- rtx_plunify.s may write the ball only through PL_BALL_ARM/PL_BALL_DROP and read its VALUE only
#           through PL_BALL_GET, so a future edit cannot arm the register and forget the rooted slot (the CFO-117
#           sibling-spelling shape); the single pendency test on r15 is allowed and named here.
#       (3) THE ROOT IS JOINED -- the collector's root-range walk must reach the trail header's ball slot, and the visit
#           must use rt_gc_visit_raw, which both marks the block and registers the slot for forwarding.
#       (4) THE HOME IS STILL THE TRAIL -- the ball macros must reach the slot through r12 and must NOT name a
#           rip-relative global, or the cure has quietly become the thing RULES.md line 231 refuses.
# FAIL_ONCE=1 plants a bare arm, drops the visit and rewrites the home as a global, and must trip arms 2, 3 and 4.
# ⛔ EVERY PATH HERE IS ANCHORED ON THIS CHECKOUT (hq_prolog 2026-09-20, D-17 PORTABLE-HOME: a criterion hardcoded to a
# sibling root grades your neighbour's checkout and reports PASS or REFUSE for reasons nobody in this lane can act on).
