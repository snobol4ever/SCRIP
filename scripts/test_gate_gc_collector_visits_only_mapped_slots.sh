# (cto, 2026-09-19, MODE QUARTET, CTO-90; ARCH-GC-COMPILE-TIME-FRAME-MAPS.md section 0 items 1, 2 and 7, section 2b;
# law RULES.md FACT RULE THE COLLECTOR GUESSES NOTHING, CEO-812; Lon 2026-09-19 in-chat: "Get those 10 down to zero in
# two turns").
#
# WHAT WAS THERE. gc_collect_ex swept every stack segment word by word with gc_zeta_frame: a raw arm that rewrote any
# word pointing into a heap block, a descriptor sniff, cons_stack, the pz seam sweep, and rt_cas_live_span's byte scan
# over the match span -- ten conservative sites at ba216c34f, counted by util_gc_census.py as `conservative total`.
# Every holder the collector could not name by type was found by value, which is exactly the guess the design forbids
# and the reason no instrument could tell a rooted program from a lucky one.
#
# WHAT IS HERE. gc_visit_segment walks every segment (the running thread from the poll's floor, the parked main thread,
# every parked co-expression) FRAME BY FRAME through the DT_MAP cells the emitter plants: each frame's interior is read
# by its sealed kind table (DESCR -> rt_gc_visit_descr, PTR_GC -> rt_gc_visit_raw, RAW and PTR_CODE never), the words
# between frames are read as DESCR cells BY THEIR TAG BYTE with the per-kind block checks the sniff carried (a
# C-built descriptor sets only the byte; emitted stores write 32 bits), a ROOT cell ends a segment only when no frame
# follows it (a co-expression thread carries the creator's frame image twice), and the registered ranges are typed
# (the Prolog trail by its entry layout, rtccb by a meter). The raw arm, the sniff, cons_stack, pz, the seam sweep and
# rt_cas_live_span are DELETED, not gated: conservative total 10 -> 0, coverage words_scanned 0.
#
# THE HOLDERS THE SWEEP HID, cured with the switch and each held by a witness below: the Prolog standing cells sat
# ABOVE the ROOT map cell (moved under it as tabled PTR_GC words); the findall accumulator handle was INTVAL(pointer);
# the spine cell reader refused C-built tags; rk_write and two multi-method roads handed heap-allocated argument
# arrays to by-name entries; g_redisp was unrooted; the DT_N arms dereferenced unchecked targets.
#
# ARMS. (1) CENSUS AND STRUCTURE: util_gc_census.py reads conservative total 0 and none of gc_zeta_frame, cons_stack,
# rt_cas_live_span, hb_scan_interior is named in gc_heap.c. (2) COVERAGE: a SNOBOL4 witness at SCRIP_GC_STRESS=1 under
# SCRIP_GC_COVERAGE=1 prints words_scanned=0 cas_scanned_bytes=0 interior_words=0 on EVERY collection, at least 50 of
# them. (3) THE WITNESS BATTERY, MODE 3: every scripts/gc_witnesses/*.ref witness matches its oracle-cut ref at
# SCRIP_GC_STRESS=1 and 5 under SCRIP_HEAP_MB=1 SCRIP_HEAP_MAX_MB=512 SCRIP_GC_POISON=1 (band printed).
# (4) THE SAME IN MODE 4 at SCRIP_GC_STRESS=5. A witness that misses its ref at the SHIPPED arena with SCRIP_GC_STRESS=0
# is not a collector reading -- nothing forced a collection -- and is NAMED and REPORTED, never graded and never
# excluded in silence (today: hb_pl_root_cells, the second-findall enumeration defect, red on origin at stress 0).
# (5) gc2 (the vendored Arizona witness, prints &collections) byte-identical to its .std 5 of 5 in both media at the
# shipped arena, named inline because &collections is arena-dependent by construction (this gate does not pin).
# (6) FAIL_ONCE=1 plants a nonzero conservative reading into arm 1 and requires the gate to red.

# ⛔⭐ DECLARED-OPEN WITNESSES (cto CTO-160, 2026-09-20, hq_icon declaring its own). THIS GATE'S POPULATION IS A DIRECTORY GLOB OVER A DIRECTORY FIVE SEATS LAND INTO, AND IT CARRIES A BLOCKING VERDICT: the moment any seat
# commits a witness for an OPEN defect, `make test` goes red for all ten seats and names a cause nobody intended. That is what happened here -- hb_file_name_unrooted is doing exactly what it was cut to do (hq_icon
# edf3bddf7: an open file's NAME is a collected-heap block held only by the C global g_fh, which is named in ZERO visit or root calls, proven A/B/A) and a witness for an open defect is SUPPOSED to be red until its cure lands.
# ⛔ A DECLARATION IS NOT AN EXEMPTION AND THIS ONE CANNOT ROT: a declared witness is STILL RUN, is COUNTED INSIDE the denominator, prints its every arm with its row, and ⭐ IF IT EVER READS ok ON EVERY GRADED ARM THE GATE
# REDS -- because that means the cure landed and the declaration is stale, and a stale declaration is how an exemption list quietly becomes the new floor. Each entry is signed by the seat whose witness it is; declaring
# ANOTHER seat's witness signs their reason for them (hq_prolog's phrase) and is not done here. Format: <witness> <owning seat> <row the cure lands under>.
# ⭐ RETIRED BY ITS OWN CURE, 2026-09-21, cfo (ICON is the cfo's cell under QUARTET, CEO-1089, and hq_icon is stood down).  The single entry was
# hb_file_name_unrooted, hq_icon's, and THIS GATE REDDED THE MOMENT THE CURE LANDED -- arm 3/4 fired "now reads ok on EVERY graded arm", which is
# exactly what the paragraph above promised it would do.  The cure is drv_gc_roots() in src/driver/driver_globals.c, which visits .name .alias .enc
# of all 64 FH slots through rt_gc_visit_raw; the witness matches its .ref at SCRIP_HEAP_MB=1 at stress 0, 1, 3 and 5.  A/B ON ONE TREE: this gate
# reads rc=0 on origin and rc=1 with the cure and the stale entry, which is the attribution and not an argument.  Deleting a stale declaration is
# not signing another seat's reason -- it is the instruction this gate prints -- and the witness is now graded like every other.  THE LIST IS EMPTY
# AND THAT IS A STATE, NOT A GAP: the next seat to cut a witness for an open defect adds a line here and signs it.
