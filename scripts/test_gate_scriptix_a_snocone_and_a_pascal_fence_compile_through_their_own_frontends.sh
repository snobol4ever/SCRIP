# languages-cannot-sit-in-one-scriptix-file; Lon: "Change that ugly SNOBOL4 code to Snocone."): the SCRIPtix splitter
# (src/driver/polyglot.c parse_scrip_polyglot) read fences named SNOBOL4 / SCRIP / Scrip, Icon, Prolog, Raku and Rebus and
# skipped every other, so a .md whose fence is Snocone or Pascal compiled nothing and printed "scrip: sm_lower failed".
# THE CURE: a Snocone fence goes through snocone_compile and the SNOBOL4 lowerer, a Pascal fence through pascal_compile and
# lower_pascal_stage2 -- exactly the pair the driver uses for a plain .sc and .pas.
#
# Three documents x two modes; the expected lines are the programs' own semantics. rc=0 clean · rc=1 a divergence · rc=2 REFUSAL.
