# test_gate_pas_a_for_statement_stays_inside_its_control_variables_type.sh -- ISO 7185 6.8.3.9, refused at compile time
#
# MEASURED 2026-09-23 by hq_pascal on SCRIP a1108b4b9, both modes, row pascal-all-test-suites-of-the-language-read-100-percent-on-the-
# suite-table-the-home-stretch (class row pascal-pat-for-loop-control-variable-protection). If the statement of a for-statement is
# executed, its initial-value and final-value shall be assignment-compatible with the control-variable's type. PAT iso7185prt1852
# runs 'for i := 0 to 10' over 'i: 1..9' and SCRIP ran it. pas_for_const_bounds checks the case decidable at compile time: both bounds
# are integer literals, the loop executes (from <= to, or from >= to for downto), and a bound falls outside the variable's subrange.
# ⛔ IT FIRES ONLY WHEN EVERY DECLARATION OF THE NAME AGREES: the parser's registries are flat, so a procedure's 'i: 1..9' outlives the
# procedure; a name that is also declared with a non-subrange type anywhere is left alone (the control's global 'i: integer' looping
# 0..20 in main after p's local 'i: 1..9' is exactly that case). Bounds that are not literals are a run-time check, not graded here.
# ⭐ WHERE THE ORACLE IS STRICTER THAN THE STANDARD: fpc -Miso refuses out-of-range literal bounds even on a loop that never executes
# ('for j := 10 to 0' over 1..9: "range check error while evaluating constants"); ISO constrains only an executed loop, and SCRIP
# follows ISO there. The oracle cannot cut a ref for that shape, so it is named here and not graded.
# Before landing, every acceptance program in the corpus was compiled with the check (PasM, the FPC suite, P4, P5, benchmarks): zero
# tripped; the only trip was the P5 copy of this same test.
#
# ARMS: the vendored witness, REFUSED with a non-empty diagnostic in BOTH modes (m4 compiles, and if the compile is accepted, links
# and runs). A second arm proves the check DISCRIMINATES: in-range to/downto loops over a subrange, a named subrange type, and the
# flat-registry case above run byte-identical to fpc -Miso in both modes. FAIL_ONCE=1 flips the witness to prove the arm can fail.
