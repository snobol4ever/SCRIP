# ⭐ WITNESS GATE for rung22 of row snobol4-ladder-every-feature-in-isolation-with-variations (cfo 2026-09-13).
# THE FORM THIS GATE EXISTS FOR is the SPITBOL manual's own ACCESS example (Ch10 p.147): "If you say X = N, that
# does not change the value of N, but it is a reference -- an 'access' to N."  A PLAIN read of a global took the
# g_gva_active fast path in bb_var_global -- two movs straight out of the GVA slot with NO call -- so the read-tap
# in NV_GET_fn could not see it AT ANY PRICE, and the sibling gate ...fires_on_a_reference_and_is_silent_on_an_
# assignment.sh had to route every arm through $() indirection to reach a tappable site.  MEASURED on the pre-cure
# binary, BOTH modes: this gate's ACCESS arms printed NOTHING AT ALL.
# ⛔ THE CURE IS COMPILE-TIME DEMOTION, NOT A RUNTIME GUARD (hq_P RULING 2026-09-13).  A load-and-branch per global
# read, on the hottest path in the language, shared by all seven frontends, paid by every program forever so that
# programs which debug themselves can be debugged, was REFUSED -- and rightly.  Instead the driver declines to build
# the GVA island at all for a program that qualifies, reaching the SAME off-state a program with no eligible globals
# already reaches.  bb_var_global is UNTOUCHED.  The trigger is CONSERVATIVE on hq_P's refinement: it fires on any
# TRACE call whose type argument is not a literal we can prove is non-ACCESS, so a COMPUTED type demotes too (arm
# 'computed') and there is no silent miss; it is latched to the SNOBOL4 family where lower_snobol4 seeds the keyword
# refusals, so no other frontend can reach it.
# ⛔ WHY THE 'gva_off_only_when_it_qualifies' ARM IS NOT DECORATION.  Whole-corpus byte identity (3121 vendored
# sources across SNOBOL4/Icon/Pascal/Prolog, 2019 of them emitting real assembly, ZERO moved) is a ONE-OFF two-binary
# measurement a gate cannot repeat.  What a gate CAN assert on ONE binary is the discrimination itself, positively:
# the GVA machinery is ABSENT from the qualifying program and PRESENT in its otherwise-identical non-qualifying twin.
# An arm that only checked absence would pass on a compiler that had lost GVA entirely.
# ⛔ NOT ASSERTED HERE, AND NAMED RATHER THAN HIDDEN: a LOWERCASE type argument.  sbl -bf accepts TRACE('N','access')
# and TRACE('N','value'); SCRIP's trace_type_parse matches with strcmp and raises error 199 for both.  That is a
# SEPARATE divergence of the type parse (it is not about ACCESS -- lowercase 'value' shows it too), it is rowed on
# its own, and curing it here would be scope riding on this cure.  The demotion itself is CORRECT for that program:
# the conservative trigger fires and the assembly demotes; the runtime then refuses the type.

# ⭐ Every 'must' below is CUT FROM THE LIVE ORACLE by the helper, which REFUSES rc=2 if sbl does not print it.
# ⭐ THE ACCESS AND VALUE ARMS ARE THE SAME SOURCE DIFFERING ONLY IN THE TYPE LITERAL, and they disagree in a way
# that could not be faked by a trace that simply fires a lot: with ACCESS the banner lands on the three READS of N
# (stmts 5, 7, 9 -- a bare assignment, a binop operand and an OUTPUT) and NOT on the assignment N = 9 at stmt 6;
# with VALUE it lands on stmt 6 ALONE.  Statement 8 (Z = M) never mentions N and is the silence control in both.
# 'ctl_omitted' pins the default: an omitted type argument must behave as VALUE, which is also what makes a
# one-argument TRACE provably non-ACCESS and therefore NOT a demotion trigger.

# qualifying set is EMPTY in both corpus and benchmarks (hq_P measured it: every TRACE under corpus/benchmarks is
# one of the non-qualifying controls above), so the cliff falls on nobody -- which is exactly why it is invisible.
# THESE FOUR QUALIFYING WITNESSES ARE THE CANARY: they are named, they live in the tree, and a seat who makes one
# of them go quiet has turned the demotion off.  The SPEED half is hq_P's lane and is carried under their row.
