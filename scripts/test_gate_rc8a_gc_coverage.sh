# test_gate_rc8a_gc_coverage.sh — RC-8a / GOAL-SN4-HOME-RBX X-1.
# ASSERTS, at a real collection: the CAS capture-pending island is walked when it is occupied. SELF-ARMING per the RBX
# GATES line: the arm PASSES only on a collection that found the island occupied and walked it.
#
# ⛔ THE WITNESS IS INLINE, AND WHY (the coo 2026-10-01, row instruments-test-gate-rc8a-gc-coverage-refuses-rc-2-...): corpus
# c06960a12 (2026-08-29) deleted corpus/probe/, so probe/mv_arbno_callcap.sno was gone and this gate refused rc 2 for a month, in
# no blocking arm, so nobody read it. That program survives as SNOBOL4 master entry 1517 (origin probe_probe_top__mv_arbno_callcap)
# and MEASURED, extracted through corpus_suite_harness.py and run at its declared --stlimit -d131072k -s4096k: 4 collections at
# SCRIP_GC_STRESS 1 and 2, max cas_scanned_bytes 0 at stress 1 2 3 8 64 -- its *p() allocates nothing, so no collection fires
# while the capture is pending and it can never arm the island again. The witness below is its shape with a deferred function
# that ALLOCATES (64 bytes a step, 200 steps) inside ARBNO(LEN(1) . *f()): at stress 1 it reads 802 collections and max
# cas_scanned_bytes=48, and prints S, as sbl -bf does. It is a gate fixture, never a suite program, so it is written here and
# graded by its output as well as by the collector line; it runs at the shipped arena and declares nothing.
#
# ⛔ TWO ASSERTIONS RETIRED, EACH BY THE COLLECTOR LANDING THAT REMOVED WHAT IT TESTED (the coo 2026-10-01, measured):
#   (1) "the RTCC block is RANGE-registered at every collection" -- be6b03b5e (2026-09-22) removed the registration on
#       purpose ("the caller-saved spill block is no longer registered as a GC root range -- the registration had no
#       consumer and told every reader a lie"); the block's invariant is now that it never holds a heap reference, graded
#       by test_gate_gc_the_caller_saved_spill_block_never_holds_a_heap_reference.sh. [GC-COV] reads ranges=0 by design.
#   (3) "pz=0 whenever a root region is registered" -- c6bf8e789 (2026-09-19, THE E SWITCH) deleted punt-zero with the
#       word sweep and the descriptor sniff, and [GC-COV] has printed no pz field since; the old arm read the absent field
#       as pz=1 and would have called it a FAIL.
#   (2) "the CAS capture-pending island is walked when occupied" -- the coo's match-records landing (CEO-1543/1545/1547, 2026-10-07)
#       deleted g_capo, g_dcf and g_dfx and the side region they were carved from: each record is now a spine region its own box
#       carves and pops, typed DESCR cells the stack walk visits, so rt_cas_gc_roots roots none of them and [GC-COV]'s
#       cas_scanned_bytes reads 0 by construction (802 collections, max 0, on the landing tree; 48 on a954b0d8e before it).
# ⛔ THE ARM THAT REPLACES IT (4): the *-target capture's record is LIVE on the spine across every collection its deferred
#   call fires -- f() allocates inside the capture, after the box carved the record and before it lands -- and its matched
#   cell is read back after the collector moved the subject. The witness builds its subject on the heap and prints the last
#   captured value (sbl -bf prints "S q"); it runs at SCRIP_GC_STRESS=1 and again with SCRIP_GC_RELOC=1. Armed when the
#   relocating run read at least one collection; a wrong value is a FAIL, no collection is a REFUSE.
# ⛔ AN UNARMED ARM MEASURED NOTHING, SO IT REFUSES (rc 2), NEVER GREEN: with (1), (2) and (3) retired arm (4) is the gate.
#
# The positive control is a SOURCE CENSUS of SCRIP's own src/ for the un-rooting escape SCRIP_GC_UNROOT. It used to grep
# "$ROOT/src" with ROOT the CORPUS, which has no src/, so the census read "unreachable" whatever the runtime held.
# Usage: bash scripts/test_gate_rc8a_gc_coverage.sh
# Exit: 0 the armed arm read the spine record back · 1 a FAIL (wrong output, or the escape is back) · 2 could not measure (no binary,
# no collection, unarmed).
