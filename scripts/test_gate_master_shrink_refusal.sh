# test_gate_master_shrink_refusal.sh — the executable DONE-WHEN for row
# `snobol4-master-guard-sync-and-builder-shrink-refusal` (hq_C, 2026-08-30).
#
# WHAT IT PROVES, and why each arm exists:
#   A. NEGATIVE — a would-collapse rebuild REFUSES rc=2 and writes NOTHING. This is the arm that matters:
#      hq_P and seat14 each reproduced `rm ALL.* && rebuild` turning a 1576-entry cut-over master into TWO
#      entries, with the build reporting SUCCESS. The guard must stop `0 < pairs << base`.
#   B. POSITIVE — the guard can say YES. A criterion nobody has watched go green is not a criterion
#      (RULES.md § TWO-PART PROOF): if this arm is missing, a builder that refused unconditionally would
#      pass arm A forever and nobody would notice until a real rebuild was needed.
#   C. ORDERING — zero pairs over a healthy master is the SUCCESS state of consolidation, not a collapse,
#      and must exit 0 with the master intact. With the collapse test placed first, `0 * 4 < 97` refused
#      raku and prolog and told them not to delete ALL.* — correct advice for a disaster, addressed to a
#      success. This arm pins the order.
#   D. PROCEDURE — the cut-over scratch-verify procedure is documented in the builder's own header, not
#      only in law prose. A procedure that lives only in a task file is not reachable from the tool.
#
# ⛔ EVERY ARM RUNS ON A SCRATCH COPY. This gate must never be able to damage the live master — which is
# the very failure it exists to prevent. It reads `corpus/tests/snobol4` and writes only under mktemp.
#

# ⛔⭐ THIS ARM WAS REWRITTEN 2026-08-30 BECAUSE IT HAD GONE VACUOUSLY GREEN, AND THE REASON IS THE LESSON.
# The original arm copied the LIVE tree and expected the builder's `len(pairs)*4 < len(base)` ratio guard to
# fire. It did, the day it was written. Then the ratio guard was CORRECTLY RETIRED (SCRIP 85e120b8, 89646b4c)
# for reasons measured by others: a count cannot detect a SUBSTITUTION, the ratio false-refused icon's
# ordinary merge (1 new pair over 534 entries), and it missed hq_P's partial cutover entirely because
# surviving sources keep the RATIO healthy while a disjoint subset has no source at all. The replacement is
# an ORIGIN-SET check -- every origin the master is known to hold must still be in the master about to be
# written -- which is strictly better.
# ⛔ SO THE ARM DID NOT CATCH A REGRESSION. IT ASSERTED A MECHANISM THAT NO LONGER EXISTS, and when the
# mechanism was improved the arm stopped exercising anything and PASSED. seat13 caught it on an unmodified
# builder while regression-testing something unrelated.
# ⭐ THE FIX IS NOT A BETTER FIXTURE, IT IS A BETTER SUBJECT: pin the PROPERTY (a rebuild must not silently
# lose entries), never the IMPLEMENTATION (this particular arithmetic). A gate written against a mechanism
# expires the moment the mechanism improves, and it expires SILENTLY -- green, not red.
