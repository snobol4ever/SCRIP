# test_gate_pl_term_inspection_iso_errors.sh — the term-inspection builtins must RAISE the ISO error, not fail and
# not succeed, AND must keep failing/succeeding where the standard says so (row prolog-term-inspection-arg-and-
# functor-do-not-validate-arguments-so-iso-errors-never-fire, hq_R 2026-09-05).
#
# WHAT THIS PINS. ISO/IEC 13211-1 § 8.5.1 functor/3 and § 8.5.2 arg/3 say each raises on an unbound or wrongly-typed
# argument. SCRIP validated nothing: the INRIA census (hq_R, SCRIP 23c6e45d6, board 316/445 outcome-class) found all
# 6 arg error goals returning a bare failure, 5 of 6 functor error goals returning a bare failure, and
# functor(T,foo,-1) returning a bare SUCCESS -- i.e. building a term of arity -1 rather than raising domain_error.
#
# ⛔⭐ THIS GATE GRADES TWO POPULATIONS, AND THE SECOND IS THE POINT. A gate that only checks that the error goals
# raise is passed just as well by a builtin that raises on EVERYTHING -- over-raising is the natural failure mode of
# an argument-validation cure, and it breaks working programs silently. So the RAISE population (12) is graded
# beside a NO-RAISE population (9) drawn from the same vendored families: the successes ISO requires, and the plain
# failures (arg past the arity, functor with the wrong arity) that must stay failures. 21 witnesses, both modes.
#
# ⛔ THE ERROR TERM IS GRADED WHOLE, NOT BY ITS FUNCTOR. `type_error(compound,atom)` and `type_error(integer,a)`
# share a functor and are different defects; the INRIA census's own "want error, got error -- right class, wrong
# functor" bucket is exactly this class. Grading the functor alone would let a cure that raises the right KIND with
# the wrong CULPRIT read green, which is the error a validation cure is most likely to make.
#
# ⛔ THE WITNESSES ARE THE VENDORED SUITE'S OWN, not hand-invented: every RAISE row is an entry of
# corpus/packages/prolog/inriasuite/{arg,functor} with its expected term copied from that file, and every NO-RAISE
# row is an entry of the same two files expecting success or failure. Nothing here is transcribed from memory.
#
# ⛔ TWO SUITE ENTRIES ARE DELIBERATELY OUT OF SCOPE and are named rather than dropped silently:
#     [(current_prolog_flag(max_arity,A), X is A + 1, functor(T,foo,X)), representation_error(max_arity)]
# in both `functor` and `functor-bis` -- current_prolog_flag/2 is NOBUILD on this engine (Prolog ladder rung 7,
# ARCH-PROLOG-BYRD-BOX-TRANSLATION.md § E), so the goal never reaches functor/3 at all. That is hq_C's ladder rung,
# not a builtins gap, and grading this row on it would grade this lane on another lane's unbuilt rung.
#
# ⭐ NOTE ON `functor-bis`, because the vendor board will look wrong to anyone who does not know: it is an
# UNDOCUMENTED NEGATIVE-CONTROL file -- absent from the suite README's own 67-file list, carrying the authors'
# comments "Must fail" / "Must succeed" / "Must instantiate Y by 3" against deliberately WRONG expectations. Its
# entry [functor(X,foo,a), failure] (commented "type_error(integer,a) expected") passed only while scrip was wrong
# in the same direction, and it MUST go red when this cure lands. A cure that leaves it green has not raised.
