# test_gate_delimited_aggregate_census_ratchet.sh -- THE DELIMITED-AGGREGATE RATCHET: the population of separator-joined value
# sites in src/ may only fall, and a fall lowers the baseline in the same landing (RULES.md FACT RULE NO DELIMITER-JOINED
# AGGREGATES; Lon 2026-09-28 08:5x CDT, in-chat to hq_pascal, verbatim: "What are seperator bytes? Are you storing data as tag
# delimited strings? Where are you doing that crazy thing?" · "Do not store records like that." · "Get rid of ALL delimited based
# processing like the one I just discovered."; ceo CEO-1349; row instruments-the-delimited-aggregate-census-ratchets-to-zero-..., the cfo).
#
# THE POPULATION is audit_delimited_aggregates_census.py's member sites -- every line where a value is joined by, split on or
# tagged with a separator byte (a control-byte literal or a macro the tree defines as one: SOH, RK_A1, RK_RX, RK_TY, STX, MON_RS,
# MON_US on 2026-09-28), attributed to its file, enclosing function and, inside the by-name dispatcher, the builtin name the
# nearest strcmp(fn, "...") above it names -- counted PER CARRIER (PASCAL, RAKU, REGISTRY_KEY, OTHER) against
# scripts/fixtures/delimited/BASELINE.tsv. The NON-MEMBERS are declared in scripts/fixtures/delimited/NON_MEMBERS.tsv with their
# reasons (x86_asm.h's TEXT-medium port mark, the monitor's wire separators, rt.c's unloaded-procedure sentinel), printed every
# run and counted separately -- never silently exempt, Lon may overrule any of them; whole-byte tables (eight or more distinct
# byte escapes on one line) are set aside by rule and printed. src/runtime/aggregates.c's \001-tagged registry keys are MEMBERS
# (CEO-1350, the cfo's view adopted): a value serialised into a string with a control byte is the class.
# ⛔ NO BINARY IS READ: this gate is a census of source text and needs no build, so it does not go through util_require_fresh.sh.
#
# ARMS:
#   1 the census's own selftest: every declared form is counted once by carrier, kind and anchor, and the comment, the name string,
#     the whole-byte table, the generated file, the definition and the declared non-member are each refused or set aside by NAME
#   2 the real tree reads EXACTLY the baseline per carrier: above it a separator-joined value landed (make it typed storage, or
#     declare a non-member with its reason for Lon's judgement); below it sites were converted and BASELINE is lowered to the new
#     count IN THE SAME LANDING, so the ratchet keeps the fall
#   3 FAIL-ONCE BUILT IN: a scratch copy of src/ with ONE planted joined-value site reads RED against the baseline, grown by
#     exactly one from the UNPLANTED count in OTHER -- judged against the tree's own count, not against BASELINE+1
#   4 THE NON-MEMBERS ARE CARRIED, NOT HIDDEN: every declared row still matches a line (a row whose site is gone reads STALE and
#     reds), and the report prints each one with its reason, so the exemption is read every run
#   5 THE ANCHOR CLASSIFIER CAN RED: a scratch dispatcher with one site under a __pas_ name and one under an __rk_ name reads
#     PASCAL 1 and RAKU 1, never OTHER
