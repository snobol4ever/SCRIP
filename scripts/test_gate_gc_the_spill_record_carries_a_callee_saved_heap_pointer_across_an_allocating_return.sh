# ARCH-GC-COMPILE-TIME-FRAME-MAPS.md section 6.5 and 6.5c (cto, 2026-09-18; F6 step 4).
#
# WHAT THIS GATE HOLDS. Section 6.5 says the callee-saved registers are made visible AT THE POLL, never in a
# per-graph map: at an allocating return the poll pushes a SPILL RECORD of tagged cells and reloads the registers
# from it after the collector returns, so a relocated subject re-enters its register fixed up. Section 6.5a then
# MEASURED that ruling rather than asserting it, and named the residual the record must carry -- r13, the subject
# base, arriving not by its seeding mov after rt_match_enter but by a reload out of the frame cell the match
# stashed it in. This gate is that record, built and held.
#
# ⛔ THE TWO FACTS THE MECHANISM TURNS ON, both read off gc_heap.c rather than off a paragraph.
#   (1) rt_gc_point_arr_c(arr, n, r0, floor) ALREADY TAKES A SHIELD ARRAY AND A FLOOR. The cells of arr are visited
#       PRECISELY, by rt_gc_visit_descr, which relocates by the cell's own type field and handles an interior
#       pointer (gc_visit_one's DT_S arm counts interiors and registers &d->s for rewrite). So the record needs no
#       new runtime symbol, no map change and no agreement: a DESCR cell handed to the poll as arr[0] is visited
#       by type and updated by construction.
#   (2) THE FLOOR IS WHAT KEEPS THE HAZARD OUT. gc_zeta_frame walks [floor, stack top) EIGHT BYTES AT A TIME and
#       its fallback arm is `if (gc_blk_of(*loc)) rt_gc_visit_raw(loc)` -- ANY word inside a heap block is visited
#       raw AND registered for rewrite when the block slides. An untagged integer left in that range therefore
#       comes back as a relocated address. The record hands the poll the CALLER's own rsp as the floor, so the
#       record and the raw scratch below it are OUT of the word-swept range and only the TAGGED cell is visited.
#       That is why section 6.5 says tagged cells and why it cannot be relaxed: this class of site returns a long,
#       not a DESCR, and spilling that long as a descriptor pair is the corruption, not the cure.
#
# THE FAIL-ONCE, RUN LIVE RATHER THAN CITED (arm 1). With the SAME sites taking the 6.5b spill-PAIR poll instead
# of the record, a SNOBOL4 deferred LEN(*N) match under SCRIP_GC_STRESS=1 printed its captures as 0xDB poison
# bytes -- a WRONG ANSWER, not a crash: the subject block slid under the match and r13 kept the dead address.
# With the record it prints X=AAA Y=AABBBBBCCCCC in both media.
#
# ARMS (all blocking, each with a planted violation -- CTO-74: ten gates could not say no).
#  1 ANSWER: the fail-once witness, under a forced collection, in mode 3 AND mode 4.
#  2 EMISSION: the record idiom in order in mode 4 -- the tagged cell, the scratch, the four arguments, the call,
#    the register reload. A dropped reload is the bug arm 1 catches only when a collection happens to fire.
#  3 COVERAGE, NOT A SPOT CHECK: every site the callee-saved census names as a COLLECTED-HEAP POINTER in a
#    callee-saved register at an allocating return must carry the record. A cure that covered nine of ten sites
#    would pass a spot check and lose an object at the tenth. A site is covered when the FIRST call after its
#    allocating return, before any jmp or ret, is the record's rt_gc_point_arr_c: by structure, not by a line window
#    (cto 2026-09-25: a 22-line window went red when af773a80e put the six-line in-line g_gc_pending test ahead of the
#    record, which it had moved to line 24 with nothing else in between).
#  4 THE FLOOR: the floor handed to the poll is exactly the rsp the record opened at, so the untagged scratch is
#    below it. A floor inside the record is the hazard above, emitted.
