# coexpr-stack-of-calls-pthread-getattr-np-on-an-uncreated-thread (hq_C 2026-09-01, corroborated by
# inspection at SCRIP bcb0ec1e; folded into coexpr-stack-leaves-the-compacting-gc-heap's landing per
# Lon's own ballot ruling: "fix its thread_id=0 defect on the way").
#
# scrip_co_stack_of (src/runtime/rt/rt_coexpr.c) used to guard only `!ctx->alive` before calling
# pthread_getattr_np(ctx->thread, ...). new_ctx->alive was set to 1 in scrip_coswitch BEFORE the
# co-expression's thread was ever created (pre-fix ~:62, well before pthread_create), so a co-expression
# reached by the GC's root-scan walk (gc_heap.c:572, unconditional over every entry in g_co_gc_head)
# during that window hit pthread_getattr_np on an uncreated thread -- undefined behaviour; on this
# glibc/Linux target it dereferences a struct pthread at the thread_id address (0 here), which reliably
# SIGSEGVs.
#
# THIS WITNESS FORCES THE EXACT STATE BY HAND rather than racing a real GC into that narrow window:
# create a real, properly-initialized scrip_coctx_t (so ctx->thread is genuinely whatever
# scrip_coexpr_create leaves it as -- proving the construction-time zero-init fix too), set ->alive = 1
# without ever creating a thread for it, and call scrip_co_stack_of directly. A fixed build must return 0
# (not-yet-created) without ever reaching pthread_getattr_np; a pre-fix build reaches
# pthread_getattr_np(0, ...) and crashes. Negative-tested both ways at mint (git-stash the fix, rebuild,
# confirm rc=139; restore, rebuild, confirm clean PASS) -- see this row's LEDGER, not asserted from
# reading the source alone.
#
# 2026-09-19 (cto, rung 2 of the coexpression rows, Lon's word that frame bytes never leave the stack): scrip_coexpr_create now
# creates the thread EAGERLY (the creator's frame image is copied onto the new thread's own stack at create time, no arena
# snapshot), so the alive-without-a-thread state exists only for rt.c's lazily started generator contexts (scrip_co_ctx_init);
# the harness checks BOTH contracts: the lazy one is refused by scrip_co_stack_of, the eager one already has its stack.
# Usage: bash scripts/test_gate_coexpr_stack_of_uncreated_thread.sh
