# test_gate_gc_eval_built_names_survive_a_collection.sh -- THE NAMES RUNTIME-COMPILED CODE BAKES SURVIVE A COLLECTION, BOTH MEDIA, THE STRESS BAND.
# ⛔ THE MEASURED DEFECT (ceo 2026-09-19, CEO-924; handed by the cto as user_function_eval_pos_replace_branch_1 reading error 41 under
# SCRIP_GC_STRESS): eval_build_chain minted the chain's target variable name with rt_heap_strdup_c, the emitter baked that heap string's
# address into the chain's code, and the first collection between the build and the run slid the string away -- NV_SET_fn was then
# called with a garbage name, the chain never assigned EVAL$, and every EVAL whose window held a collection FAILED as a statement
# (an empty string, a null pattern that matched with no captures, a deferred call that never ran). Traced with gdb from the capture
# island's top never moving, through the chain's assign box, to the garbage name. The class: a compile-time string the emitter bakes
# must live in the compile-time arena (ct_alloc, mmap-backed, never moves), never in the collected heap; the SNOBOL4 lowering held five
# more such sites (computed-goto target names and folded literals), converted in the same landing.
# The witness runs at SCRIP_GC_STRESS=0,1,3,5,10 in BOTH modes against a ref cut from sbl -bf; a stale binary or a missing witness REFUSES rc=2.
