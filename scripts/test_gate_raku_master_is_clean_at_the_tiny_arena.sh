# test_gate_raku_master_is_clean_at_the_tiny_arena.sh -- RAKU'S ITEM 4 OF THE GC COMMITMENT (hq_raku, row
# raku-gc-zero-gradings-lost-to-the-collector-across-the-arena-and-stress-axes-named-not-counted; ceo CEO-1039/1040,
# TENET). GOAL: "ZERO GRADINGS LOST TO THE COLLECTOR" -- the arena and stress axes must cost this lane nothing,
# proven per entry, on a named tree, with the instrument shown able to catch a real divergence first.
#
# ⛔ THIS IS THE RAKU INSTANCE OF THE SHARED SHAPE, NOT A NEW DESIGN. Ported from
# test_gate_pl_master_is_clean_at_the_tiny_arena.sh (SCRIP 46f348488, hq_prolog, built on hq_snobol4's catch that
# an arena-only band reads GREEN over an arena-insensitive stress-sensitive class). Same per-entry oracle-diff
# shape, same decidability positive-control, same VANISHED/DIVERGENT/INCONCLUSIVE-SLOW vocabulary. Nothing here
# was re-derived; only the language, the suite path and the declared axis points changed.
#
# ⛔⭐⭐ WHY THIS LANE IN PARTICULAR CANNOT SKIP THIS GATE. Raku is where the class was FOUND: the master at
# SCRIP_HEAP_MB=1 SCRIP_GC_STRESS=16 lost 65 gradings over 36 distinct programs against the same tree and binary
# with stress unset -- every one exit 0, no diagnostic, a plausible wrong answer (row
# raku-gc-thirty-six-programs-return-a-silently-wrong-answer-under-forced-collection..., DONE). TWO CAUSES, BOTH
# CURED AT SCRIP a7ba722b3: a C LOCAL (`__rk_arr_map`'s accumulator) held across a re-entry into emitted code, and
# a C STATIC TABLE (`gram_reg[]`) of heap strings no roots function visited -- NEITHER was an unmapped slot, so no
# per-slot census would ever have found either. This gate is what turns that one-off finding into a standing,
# re-runnable instrument, so a future landing that reopens either class (or a third one like it) is caught the
# same day rather than the same month.
#
# ⛔⭐ TWO AXES, BECAUSE ONE AXIS READS GREEN OVER THE CLASS -- hq_snobol4's catch, inherited via the Prolog gate.
# The cured defects here were ALSO arena-INDEPENDENT BY CONSTRUCTION (a C local and a C static table are
# unreachable at any arena size), so an arena-only A/B at stress=0 would have read clean on this exact class and
# meant nothing -- measured in this row's own baton, not assumed. Confirmed in the mechanism: gc_heap.c
# c_rt_gcheap_alloc reads SCRIP_GC_STRESS once into a static and raises g_gc_pending every N allocations,
# orthogonal to window size; unset means zero forced collections.
#   ARM control  : shipped window (512 MB), no forced collection -- the baseline every other arm is diffed against
#   ARM arena    : SCRIP_HEAP_MB=1, no forced collection          -- does a SMALL WINDOW alone change an answer
#   ARM stress:N : SCRIP_HEAP_MB=1 + SCRIP_GC_STRESS=N             -- does COLLECTING OFTEN change an answer
# ⛔ MEASURED, NOT ASSUMED: SCRIP_GC_STRESS=0 and SCRIP_GC_STRESS unset are THE SAME CONFIGURATION.
# gc_heap.c:245 reads `stress_n = e ? atol(e) : 0` and :246 gates the plant on `stress_n > 0`, so an explicit 0
# and an absent env var both leave the plant permanently off. The task's declared stress point "0" is therefore
# not a missing eighth arm -- it IS the `arena` arm above, and this file does not spend a redundant run on it.
#
# ⛔⭐⭐ A STRESS BAND, NEVER A STRESS POINT, AND SPAN BOTH ENDS -- ceo CEO-1024. hq_raku's own map-family window
# was 1-6 and INVISIBLE at >=8 while the grammar family was wrong at every point above 0; hq_snobol4 has a witness
# red at m4 stress 25 while green at 10/12/16/20/35/50. Whatever a band finds is a lower bound, never a
# population. THE DECLARED BAND HERE IS THE TASK'S OWN AXIS LIST (CEO-1039/1040), not a locally chosen one:
# stress in {1,3,5,8,16} plus the {0 == arena} point above.
#
# ⛔ A TIMEOUT IS NOT A DIVERGENCE. Under stress a correct program can run orders of magnitude slower; rc=124
# cannot distinguish "needs longer" from "never finishes". The stress arm raises the harness per-program TIMEOUT,
# and a pair whose ONLY movement is into HANG is reported INCONCLUSIVE-SLOW and REFUSES rc=2 -- never counted as
# a collector defect, never dropped to keep the gate green.
#
# ⛔ NOT WIRED INTO `make test`, ON PURPOSE -- seven full master boards is ~7x a single board, and TENET
# condition 2 is that the blocking set is the shared resource that does not scale with seats. This is a
# DELIBERATE gate: the owning row runs it and a landing claiming raku's GC share is clean cites its output.
#
# ⛔ REFUSES rc=2 RATHER THAN REPORTING A CLEAN IT COULD NOT MEASURE: no binary, no suite, an arm that printed no
# SUITE_BOARD line, a shard that recorded zero progress rows, two arms whose entry sets differ (VANISHED/APPEARED,
# named not counted), or an inconclusive HANG. A short count is never a green here.
