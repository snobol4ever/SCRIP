# THE SAFE-POINT CENSUS MUST NOT READ A PARTIAL CURE AS A WHOLE ONE (coo, CEO-1109 rank 0, 2026-09-22).
#
# ⛔ THE DEFECT, FOUND BY THE cto AND NOT BY READING THE CODE.  util_gc_census.py safe-points decides POLLED
# by finding poll text in SOURCE within --poll-window lines after the call.  POLLED is a claim about EMITTED
# CONTROL FLOW, and the emitter builds its output by string concatenation, so a call written ONCE inside a
# file-local helper or a #define is spliced into EVERY path that expands that unit.  Where a unit expands
# more than once the two questions come apart, and they come apart in the worst direction: ONE poll in a
# shared body reads the site fully POLLED however many of its paths carry it.  bb_assign_global's comm_var
# tap is that shape -- one x86("call", ...) line, FOUR expansion sites -- and at one of them the fresh
# string is live only in rax:rdx, rooted nowhere.  The cto declined to poll the rooted paths alone and left
# the tap unpolled, which is why this is an instrument row and not a retraction of anyone's landing.
#
# ⛔ THIS GATE PLANTS ITS OWN FAILURE RATHER THAN ASSERTING IT.  The tree cannot produce the bad shape on
# demand -- today partially_polled reads 0 -- so an arm proven only by reading is no arm at all.  FAIL_ONCE
# builds a mktemp root whose bb_assign_global.cpp carries a poll GUARDED BY g_gva_active, which genuinely
# reaches two of the four expansions, and requires the census to call it PARTIAL.  Under the old criterion
# that same plant read a clean POLLED, and the gate proves that too by showing the poll text IS inside the
# source window it would have been read from.  ⛔ NOTHING UNDER src/ IS TOUCHED: the fixture symlinks the
# real .so and the other emitter directories and copies only src/templates/bb (CEO-547 -- a gate's own
# mktemp fixture outside the corpus tree is not a board).
#
# ARMS, EACH BY EXIT CODE: 0 the census declares multi_path_sites and partially_polled, the identity
# partitions the denominator, and the unplanted fixture reads the cto's tap UNPOLLED (their own account of
# what they did); 1 the planted two-of-four reads anything but PARTIAL; 2 a prerequisite is missing.
set -uo pipefail
# ⛔ NO `printf ... | grep -q` IN THIS GATE.  grep -q exits at the first match, printf takes SIGPIPE, and under
# `set -o pipefail` the pipeline then reports FAILURE on a successful match.  It only bites on output big enough
# that printf is still writing -- SCRIP_GC_CENSUS_LIST_ALL prints ~1 MB here -- so it passes on a small fixture and
# lies on the real one.  Every match below is a herestring.
