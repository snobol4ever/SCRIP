# said "a master suite run is a board and this seat is not the coo" -- which is CEO-523 working exactly as written.
# So the defect was never the guard and never the comparison: it was a BOARD SITTING IN THE BLOCKING SET. This grades
# both halves of the cure -- the gate is out of `make test` and in the coo's pass, AND the comparison still measures
# and can still say no. ⛔ NO POPULATION LITERAL: every count is read from what the gate prints.
