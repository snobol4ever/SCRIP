# util_recut_truncated_ipl_refs.sh -- re-cut ipl .std refs that the 2026-09-05 cutter wrote one byte short.
#
# THE DEFECT THIS REPAIRS (hq_I 2026-09-06, FINDING-2026-09-06-hq_I-the-cutter-was-fixed-and-its-artifacts-
# were-not-so-58-of-89-refs-are-one-byte-short.md). util_cut_icon_ipl_refs.sh at da466d28f wrote each ref as
#     out1="$(cat "$OUT1")" ; printf '%s' "$out1" > "$std"
# and command substitution strips ALL trailing newlines, so every ref minted through that path lost its final
# newline. The cutter was later repaired to `cp` the captured file, which is byte-exact -- but the repair
# never reached the 66 refs the broken version had already minted. FIXING AN INSTRUMENT DOES NOT FIX ITS
# OUTPUT, AND ONLY THE INSTRUMENT IS UNDER TEST: a gate proves the cutter is right today and says nothing
# about the artifacts that are doing the grading. Each such ref is a FALSE FAIL charged to the compiler for
# any program whose output ends in a newline.
#
# WHAT THIS REFUSES TO DO, WHICH IS THE POINT:
#   - It NEVER writes SCRIP's output into a ref. Every byte comes from the oracle. SCRIP and the oracle
#     agreeing is the condition under which self-pinning is most tempting and most wrong.
#   - It re-cuts ONLY when the existing ref is EXACTLY the oracle's output minus trailing newlines. Any
#     other difference means the ref is wrong for some OTHER reason, which is a defect to diagnose, never
#     to overwrite -- overwriting it would erase the evidence and manufacture a pass.
#   - It requires the oracle to exit rc=0 and to be byte-identical across TWO runs. ⛔ A program whose
#     oracle run is KILLED (rc=124) is refused even when its output is byte-stable: stability under a
#     timeout is a reproducible truncation, not determinism, and a ref pinned to a killed process pins a
#     lie. progs/oldicon.icn is the live case -- iconx itself is killed there because it drives vim.
#   - With no --apply it CHANGES NOTHING and prints the same table, so the decision is reviewable first.
