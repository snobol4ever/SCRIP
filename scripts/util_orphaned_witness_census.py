"""Census the WITNESS PAIRS that no denominator contains.

A witness pair is a loose `<name><ext>` beside a `<name>.ref` under `corpus/tests/<lang>/`.
It is ORPHANED when its name appears NOWHERE in that language's `ALL.csv`, `ALL.xfail` or
`ALL.excluded.txt` -- so it is not passing, not expected-failing, and not excluded: no
denominator contains it, and no board has ever run it.

WHY THIS IS ITS OWN SHAPE, worse than an xfail (ceo CEO-414, hq_P 2026-09-08):
an xfail is at least censused by test_gate_no_xfail_survives.sh.  An orphan appears in NO
count we keep, because every count starts from ALL.csv.  The SNOBOL4 master read 1894/1894
FAIL=0 with a SEGFAULTING witness (nested_arbno_rpos) sitting in the tree beside it.

MEMBERSHIP IS DELIBERATELY GENEROUS -- a name counts as KNOWN if it appears anywhere in any
of the three files, not merely in the `entry` column.  Absorbed entries are often renamed and
carry the loose filename only in `origin`, so a strict column match would manufacture orphans.
Being generous means this census UNDER-reports; every name it does report is one that three
files never mention at all.  ⛔ That direction is the safe one for a ratchet and it is why the
gate built on this can refuse growth without ever firing on a rename.
