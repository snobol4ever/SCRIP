"""util_emitted_alloc_cost.py -- THE EMITTED COST OF AN ALLOCATION SITE, IN BYTES AND IN INSTRUCTIONS.

⛔⭐ LON, IN-CHAT TO THE ceo 2026-09-20 13:3x CDT, VERBATIM: "Ensure that you do not bloat BBs with GC allocation code
that is more than 4-6 instructions. Beware of code size getting too large."  The ceo made it MANDATORY rather than
optional the same sitting (CEO-997, granting the coo's CEO-985 ask): every arm measuring the inline-versus-leaf class
carries its EMITTED BYTE COUNT beside its wall clock, BOTH ARMS, same tree plus the one change -- and THE INSTRUCTION
COUNT AT THE SITE, DISASSEMBLED, IS THE GRADED QUANTITY, because Lon gave a number and a number nothing reads is a wish.

⛔ THIS IS NOT test_gate_instr_budget.sh AND THE TWO MUST NOT BE CONFUSED.  That gate pins callgrind Ir -- instructions
EXECUTED at run time, a property of the workload.  This one counts instructions EMITTED at the site -- a property of the
code we generate, which is what Lon's sentence is about.  A change can move either one without the other.

⛔⭐ WHY THE SITE COUNT COMES FROM THE *BEFORE* ARM, and this is the whole measurement rather than a detail: the point of
the inline bump is that the `call` DISAPPEARS, so counting "allocation sites" in the after arm counts the very thing the
change removes and the per-site cost would divide by a number that fell.  THE NUMBER OF ALLOCATION SITES IS A PROPERTY OF
THE PROGRAM, not of the form we emit them in, so the before arm -- where every site still names itself with a call to an
entry in GC_ALLOC_TAB -- is what counts them, for both arms.  ⭐ THE cto GAVE THIS RULE A STRONGER REASON THAN MINE
(2026-09-20, from their own hand disassembly): in their after arm the call was STILL THERE as the miss path, so counting
sites in the after arm would have counted ONE site twice -- once as a call, once as an inline sequence -- and divided by
two.  The before-arm rule holds whether the change REMOVES the call or KEEPS it, which is the property, and "the call
disappears" was only the case I happened to be looking at.
⛔ ITS FIRST REAL READING RETIRED THE ROW IT WAS BUILT FOR, WHICH IS WHAT AN INSTRUMENT IS FOR (Lon, in-chat to the cto
2026-09-20, verbatim: "So forget the inline GC bump. It is just too long."):  ONE concat site in
bench_icnstr_concat_table.icn went 15 -> 86 emitted instructions, the bump ALONE 27 against Lon's ceiling of 6, object
text 3319 -> 3923 bytes over the program.  The cto's arithmetic for whoever proposes emitted allocation next: eight
instructions are irreducible before any guard, every available fold stops at thirteen, and 4-6 needs pre-formatted
size-class runs -- a different collector.  --max-insns expresses a different bar (the bump plus the separately granted
owner guard of up to 5 is --max-insns 11); the DEFAULT stays Lon's 6 so nobody inherits a widened bar by accident.  Same program, same tree plus the one change: that is the
control the INSTRUMENT LAWS require of a before/after pair, and this tool refuses a pair that does not carry it.

MEASURE ONE TREE:   util_emitted_alloc_cost.py measure <program> [<program>...] [--label L] [--out FILE]
GRADE A PAIR:       util_emitted_alloc_cost.py grade --before A.tsv --after B.tsv [--max-insns 6]
PROVE IT CAN FAIL:  util_emitted_alloc_cost.py --selftest

Every line it prints names its tree, its mode and its arena, because a number that does not is not labelled (RULES.md
THE INSTRUMENT LAWS).  rc=0 measured and within the bar, rc=1 OVER THE BAR (a real finding), rc=2 COULD NOT MEASURE.
