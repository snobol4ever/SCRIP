# test_gate_sno_pos_rpos_dynamic_operand.sh -- POS(N)/RPOS(N) with a DYNAMIC (variable) integer argument, under
# an ARBNO that has moved RSP, are read through the raw RSP-relative operand spelling FRQ(op_sa+8) instead of
# the frame-slot-safe XSAQ every other dynamic-argument match box already uses (any/notany/break/breakx/span/
# tab/rtab, plus LEN since its 2026-09-05 XSAQ cure -- src/templates/bb/bb_match_len.cpp). Because POS/RPOS are
# ZERO-WIDTH, a garbage cursor can never fault -- so instead of crashing (LEN's class) the match returns the
# WRONG ANSWER SILENTLY at rc=0, in BOTH modes, and no board anywhere flags it.
#
# PROVEN by hq_U 2026-09-05 (SCRIP 23c6e45d6 / corpus 7ffe8b899, oracle /home/resources/x64/bin/sbl -bf): three
# witnesses, 20/20 WRONG at every swept filename length, deterministic (unlike the LEN class's 13-18/20, which
# reads a garbage INDEX that sometimes faults -- POS/RPOS read a garbage cursor into a COMPARISON, which is
# simply never equal). Row snobol4-pos-rpos-dynamic-operand-returns-a-silently-wrong-answer.
#
# ⛔ THIS GATE IS WITNESS-ONLY (seat11, rung 1): it PROVES the class, it does not cure it -- the cure
# (src/templates/bb/bb_match_pos.cpp, bb_match_rpos.cpp) is hq_U's to author. It is EXPECTED to read RED/
# VIOLATION(1) until that cure lands; a RED verdict here is this gate doing its job, not a broken gate. Once
# the cure lands this becomes the standing regression gate for the class -- same script, no rewrite needed,
# only the tree underneath changes from red to green.
#
# ⛔ THE SWEEP IS NOT OPTIONAL (hq_S FINDING-2026-09-05-hq_S-nqueens-is-a-dynamic-len-operand-read-through-a-
# moving-rsp-not-an-arbno-recede.md sec 2): argv length shifts the initial stack, which shifts every RSP-
# relative address, so a single invocation is one sample of a coin. Every witness AND control below runs at
# BASENAME lengths 1..20 (a run of 'x' characters plus the .sno extension) in BOTH modes -- a single-length or
# single-mode read of any of them is not evidence of anything. These three witnesses happen to be deterministic
# (20/20 at every length observed), but the sweep runs regardless: determinism is a property of the witness,
# not of the class, and a gate that samples once would read a future, less-deterministic sibling as cured when
# it is 1/20.
#
# CONTROLS (pos_dyn_lit, rpos_dyn_lit, pos_dyn_noarbno, rpos_dyn_inline) discriminate this class from a plain
# alternation/ARBNO semantics bug: a literal argument, no ARBNO, and the inline RPOS shape are all correct
# today and MUST stay correct under the identical sweep, or this gate cannot tell "the known class" from "a new
# regression" apart.
#
# rc=0 CLEAN (nothing swept diverges from the oracle, in either mode), rc=1 VIOLATION (at least one does),
# rc=2 UNPROVEN (no oracle, no fresh binary, or a zero denominator -- never printed as a pass).
