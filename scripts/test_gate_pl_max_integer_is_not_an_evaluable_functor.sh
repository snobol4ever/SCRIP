# THE THIRD FACE OF THE UNBOUNDED/BOUNDED CONTRADICTION, found while curing the second (cto 2026-09-13,
# f0cb8f140 deleted the max_integer and min_integer FLAGS). `X is max_integer` still answers
# 9223372036854775807 and `X is min_integer` answers -9223372036854775808 -- a ceiling this implementation
# no longer has, published through a different mechanism than the flag table: pl_arith_names.h maps the two
# names to the maxi/mini arms of the arity-0 evaluable dispatch.
#
# ⭐ NEITHER NAME IS AN ISO EVALUABLE FUNCTOR. ISO 9.1.3 enumerates the evaluable functors and neither
# appears; the oracle agrees and is the discriminator -- swipl raises
# type_error(evaluable, max_integer/0), and our own engine ALREADY raises exactly that shape for an
# unknown name (`X is foo` gives type_error(evaluable, foo/0) here today), so the cured answer is a
# deletion and not a new error path.
#
# ⛔ WHAT THIS GATE MUST NOT DO IS PASS BY ACCIDENT. It demands the ERROR TERM, not merely a failure or
# a non-answer: a witness that merely failed would also be printed by an engine that cannot evaluate
# anything at all. The control arm is `X is foo`, which must keep raising type_error(evaluable, foo/0)
# in the same run -- if the control goes quiet the witness proves nothing about these two names.
