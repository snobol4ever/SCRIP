# test_gate_sno_host_minus_one_answers_the_memory_statistics.sh -- HOST(-1,n), n = 0..7, answers SPITBOL's eight memory
# statistics with SCRIP's OWN numbers, and a refused selector raises ERROR 254 as it does under the oracle (ceo CEO-1397; Lon 2026-10-02, in-chat
# to the ceo: "fix all the real gaps and ignore the expected differences").
#
# ⛔⭐ FOUND ON spitbol_x64_tests/gcbuster.sbl, THE ONE X64T RED: SCRIP's HOST had no arm for a negative selector and answered
# null, so MEMINCB, DATABTS, BASEMEM, TOPMEM, STACKSIZ, STACKCUR, WORDSIZE and STACKMAX stayed null and the program's &DUMP
# omitted eight variables -- a SHAPE difference. The VALUES are the implementation's own (memory increment, heap cap, base and
# top addresses, stack size, stack in use, word size, stack high-water mark) and differ by allocator and address space, so they
# are ORACLE IDENTITY (CEO-1344) and masked in the package's ALL.mask; what this gate pins is that every selector ANSWERS and
# the answers stand in the relations SPITBOL's own stand in. SPITBOL's dispatcher is osint/syshs.c case -1 (0 memincb, 1 databts,
# 2 basemem, 3 topmem, 4 stacksiz - 400, 5 stack in use, 6 sizeof(long), 7 stack high-water mark, any other selector or a
# non-integer one EXIT_1, which sbl reports as ERROR 254 'erroneous argument for host'; a missing or null selector reads 0 and a
# numeric string converts -- all five measured against sbl -bf on 2026-10-02 before this gate was written).
#
# THE ARMS: the witness runs under &ERRLIMIT so a raised 254 fails its statement, and prints only RELATIONS over the values (and
# the word size and &ERRTYPE), so the oracle and SCRIP print the SAME lines though their numbers differ:
#   1  the oracle (sbl -bf) prints the expected lines, 'selector 8 fails 254' among them  (cut at run time -- refuses if not)
#   2  m3 prints byte-identical lines          3  m4 prints byte-identical lines
#   4  DETECTOR -- the three refused selectors each read 254 and none answered, in both modes, so a HOST that answered every
#      selector with some integer cannot pass, and a HOST answering null prints 'wordsize ' with no relation lines and fails 2-3
# EXIT: 0 all arms pass · 1 an arm failed · 2 REFUSED (no binary, no oracle, oracle shape moved).
