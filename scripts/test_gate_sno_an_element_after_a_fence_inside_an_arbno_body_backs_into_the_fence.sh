# test_gate_sno_an_element_after_a_fence_inside_an_arbno_body_backs_into_the_fence.sh -- INSIDE AN ARBNO BODY, AN ELEMENT AFTER
# FENCE(P) THAT FAILS BACKS INTO THE FENCE, AND THE FENCE INTO WHAT PRECEDES IT IN THE SAME ITERATION (cfo 2026-09-30, found in the
# probe matrix closing the ARBNO-then-FENCE hang row: 'bbz' ? POS(0) ARBNO(ARBNO('b') FENCE('b') 'z') RPOS(0) -- sbl yes, SCRIP no).
# THE DEFECT, read in the emitted mode-4 code: the 'z' after the FENCE failed straight to the enclosing ARBNO's body-omega
# (`jne .Lmatch_arbno_omega`), skipping FENCE's beta, so the inner ARBNO('b') left of the fence was never asked to grow and the whole
# iteration failed. src/lower/lower_snobol4.c's fenced TT_SEQ builds right to left; its outside-ARBNO branch re-routes the right-hand
# run's failure into the FENCE's beta (sno_resume_omega_to on right_tail), and the inside-ARBNO branch (SNO_FENCE_LIT_ARG_IN_ARBNO)
# never did. THE CURE: the same re-route, and right_sealed cleared, in the inside-ARBNO branch. It holds since 32b404921 made
# FENCE's beta restore the cursor it found at alpha -- before that, routing into FENCE's beta would hand the inner ARBNO a stale one.
# ARMS: (1) mode 3 and (2) mode 4 print scripts/fixtures/pattern/fence_inside_arbno_body_retries_its_left.{sno,ref} (ref cut from
# sbl -bf): E1-E3 and E5 RED on the parent (no where sbl says yes) -- an inner ARBNO, a leading literal, an alternation and a
# two-arm fence body left of the trailing element; E4, E6, E7 controls (no element after the fence, a subject that must fail, no
# FENCE) that were green before. rc 0 both agree · 1 a hang or a diff · 2 no binary or fixture.
