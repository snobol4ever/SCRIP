# test_gate_gc_the_poll_is_a_register_preserving_asm_leaf.sh -- THE SAFE-POINT POLL IS AN ASM LEAF, AND IT PRESERVES EVERY REGISTER IT TOUCHES.
#
# THE RULE (Lon 2026-09-22, in-chat to the ceo, verbatim: "Why not make the poll an ASM call instead of a C call? It is big?"; ceo CEO-1105).
# The C rt_gc_poll is 43 instructions at -O0 and pays for a frame, an %fs:0x28 stack-protector canary load AND verify, and a GOT hop, all to
# test two flags. Worse than its size: it is a C function, so by the SysV ABI it may clobber rax rcx rdx rsi rdi r8-r11 -- which is WHY the site
# helper family spills and reloads around it (x86_rt_gc_poll_res is 7 instructions AT THE SITE, _rec_sigma ~14, _rec_sigma_pair ~20, against
# Lon's 4-6 budget in RULES.md FACT RULE -- AN EMITTED ALLOCATION SEQUENCE IS AT MOST 4-6 INSTRUCTIONS AT THE SITE).
#
# rt_gc_poll_asm is 19 instructions, has no frame and no canary, and RESTORES EVERY REGISTER IT WRITES. It lives as a file-scope __asm__ block
# inside gc_heap.c rather than under src/runtime/rtx/ for one measured reason: g_gc_in and g_hp_gcline are FILE-LOCAL statics (nm reads them
# lowercase 'b'), so a separate .s file cannot name them at all. g_hp_top is a MACRO over g_hp_fr.top at offset 0, whose offsets the file already
# pins with _Static_assert for exactly this purpose -- rtx_alloc.s reads the same struct the same way.
#
# ⛔ WHAT THIS GATE DOES NOT CLAIM, stated so nobody reads it as broader than it is: PRESERVING A REGISTER IS NOT RELOCATING IT. A DESCR live in
# rax:rdx across a collection must be SPILLED AS A TAGGED CELL so the walker can move it; restoring the old bits hands back a STALE pointer. That
# is why the per-site _res / _rec_* variants still exist and still encode type knowledge the leaf cannot guess. This gate holds the leaf, not them.
