# test_gate_sno_eval_of_an_unevaluated_expression_is_no_function_level.sh -- AN EXPR THUNK IS NOT A FUNCTION CALL, AND
# THE CALL THAT ENTERS IT HANDS ITS EPILOGUE THE TRUE LEVEL WORD (hq_zetas 2026-10-08, row spine-bake-...-ceo-1362, layer
# 11 d chunk 2a; the cto asked for a witness with a SPITBOL ref for each of the two defects the chunk cured).
#
# DEFECT 1 -- EVAL OF AN UNEVALUATED EXPRESSION COUNTED A FUNCTION LEVEL. The compiler makes *(expr) a thunk procedure
# (EXPR$n, thunk_kind EXPR) registered dyn_scope, and rt_proc_touches_level counted every dyn_scope procedure as a call
# that moves &FNCLEVEL, so OUTPUT = EVAL(*(&FNCLEVEL)) at top level printed 1 where SPITBOL prints 0 (arm a1). The cure is
# the THUNK bit on the procedure record (startup flag 64, rt_proc_set_thunk in mode 3): a thunk keeps dyn_scope 1 for
# every reader that routes it, and only the level accounting, the dyn prologue and the enter road read the bit.
#
# DEFECT 2 -- rt_proc_enter HANDED ITS EPILOGUES A GARBAGE LEVEL WORD. The asm leaf moved the result to rdi:rsi and jumped
# to rt_proc_call_epilogue_gamma(frame0, touched) with rdx unset, so touched was the result's high qword: a string result
# decremented the level, an integer zero did not. Arm a2 reaches the leaf through APPLY('EVAL', thunk) -- the C road
# rt_sno_dtx_value_rec -> rt_call_proc_descr_p -> rt_proc_enter; a plain EVAL(thunk) opens by the tail road, whose level
# word rides in the call word and never reaches this leaf -- with a thunk yielding a string and one yielding the integer 0,
# then EVAL(*(&FNCLEVEL)) inside the function; every &FNCLEVEL must read as SPITBOL's. The leaf now takes touched as its
# third argument and keeps it in one slot, laid out as rt_proc_enter_barrier kept its nsb.
# NON-VACUOUS, MEASURED: with the leaf's gamma landing made to drop the slot (addq $8 in place of popq %rdx) a2 reads
# st/0/0/0/0/0/-1 where SPITBOL reads st/1/0/1/1/1/0, in both modes.
#
# ARM a3 -- THE RE-ENTRY THE SELF-SAVE EXISTED FOR. A thunk re-entered during its own evaluation (F evaluates EVAL(X)
# where X = *(F()), three deep, through EVAL and through a deferred pattern element) with no save and no restore of the
# result cell: the body writes the cell and reads it back with no call in between, so an inner activation cannot clobber
# an outer one's value (the cto's ruling of 2026-10-08). Mode 4 had already run this way since layer 11 c.
#
# MEASURED on the control at origin a71d1a339: a1 printed 1 (SPITBOL 0), a2 st/1/0/1/2/1/0 (SPITBOL st/1/0/1/1/1/0, the
# EVAL(*(&FNCLEVEL)) inside the function one too high); a3 matched. Every arm grades m3 and m4 against SPITBOL.
#
# EXIT: 0 all arms match SPITBOL. 1 an arm regressed. 2 UNPROVEN (no built scrip / no oracle).
