# test_icon_ir_rung_36.sh — rung36: JCON integration suite (75 tests) — IC-7
# Tests marked .xfail are known-unimplemented features (co-expressions, large integers,
# &error trapping, etc.) — they count as XFAIL, not FAIL.
# ⛔ 2026-08-29 (seat07, row tests-consolidate-icon): 32 of the 75 were converted into a suite pair
# (rung36_all.icn/.ref, see corpus's tests/icon/KEEP.md ## rung36) and their loose .icn/.expected
# files no longer exist. Per FINDING-2026-08-29-hq_P-converting-a-family-silently-disarms-its-
# per-family-glob-script.md: a converted family's entries MUST be delegated to the harness, never
# left to fall through this script's own [ -f ... ] checks as a silent SKIP (SKIP is not checked by
# the final `[ "$FAIL" -eq 0 ]`, so 32 silently-skipped tests would still read as a clean pass). The
# remaining 43 (29 still-red .xfail witnesses + 14 newly-found-red, see KEEP.md) stay loose and are
# still tested individually below, unchanged — only the now-converted 32 moved to delegation.
