# test_gate_s4e_done_timeout_is_a_refusal.sh -- `s4e_msg.sh done` budgets its DONE-WHEN at 3600s by DEFAULT, and a
# criterion that does not finish inside that budget is a REFUSAL (rc=2, "I could not measure"), never a red criterion
# (rc=1, "I measured and it is not done"). Both outcomes quote the budget they ran under AND the wall-clock they used.
# Row s4e-done-timeout-default-below-make-test-under-fleet-load (hq_B measured 2026-09-03, ceo dispatched rank 0): the
# default was 900s while `make test` measures ~1100s on this box under twelve seats, so every DONE-WHEN containing
# `make test` -- every rung baton, most instrument rows -- died at the default for a reason unrelated to the work AND
# reported it as "NOT DONE ... exited 124", sending the seat off to debug work that was already finished.
# THREE ARMS against a THROWAWAY postoffice under mktemp -- never the live one -- each run against the live
# s4e_msg.sh and against mutated copies with one half of the cure removed (FAIL-ONCE, INSTRUMENT LAWS fifth batch):
#   (A) DEFAULT IS 3600 -- BEHAVIOURALLY, not by grep: with S4E_DONE_TIMEOUT unset, a passing criterion's receipt
#       says `timeout 3600s`. A grep proves the string is in the file; this proves the value reached `timeout`.
#   (B) TIMEOUT IS A REFUSAL: S4E_DONE_TIMEOUT=1 against a sleeping criterion -> rc=2, the word REFUSED, the budget
#       and the elapsed named, NO "NOT DONE" verdict, and the claim NOT closed.
#   (C) A RED CRITERION IS STILL RED: a fast non-zero criterion -> rc=1, "NOT DONE", budget and elapsed named.
# EXIT 0 all three hold on the live script AND each mutant goes red; 1 otherwise; 2 REFUSED (fixture cannot be built).
