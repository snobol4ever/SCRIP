# c_alloc_* 2740, suite_pop_diff 481, ...) and shell bodies whose work dir outlived a signal. Two static arms, NO BUILD:
#   ARM 1  every tempfile.mkdtemp( / mkstemp( in scripts/*.py either registers its own removal ON THE SAME LINE
#          (atexit ... rmtree / TemporaryDirectory) or sits in a file carrying at least as many rmtree/unlink/remove calls
#          as creations. Offenders must be 0 -- an absolute, because the cure is one clause per site.
#   ARM 2  scripts/*.sh calling mktemp with no `trap` anywhere in the file: a RATCHET, at most CEIL (lowered, never raised).
# SELF-PROOF first, on fixtures under mktemp: a planted bare mkdtemp reads 1 offender, a planted registering line reads 0.
