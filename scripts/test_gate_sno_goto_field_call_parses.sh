# test_gate_sno_goto_field_call_parses.sh -- A FUNCTION CALL IN THE SNOBOL4 GOTO FIELD PARSES, in both modes.
#
# WHAT THIS IS: the parse-level regression pin for the goto-field call construct -- :(GO()), :(RET('C2')),
# :S(PR(6,W V)) -- landed by hq_P 2026-09-05 (row snobol4-goto-field-function-call-is-invoked-by-name-and-
# scrip-is-exactly-inverted; FINDING-2026-09-05-hq_P-goto-field-call-is-by-name-and-the-six-m4-buildfail-
# xfails-are-five-mechanisms.md). Before that landing every one of these forms died at PARSE time, which is
# what hid the real defect underneath for as long as it did.
#
# ⛔⭐ WHAT THIS GATE DELIBERATELY DOES NOT GRADE, AND WHY THE OMISSION IS THE POINT: it does not assert what
# the construct DOES at run time. When this gate was written SCRIP was INVERTED against SPITBOL there -- it
# accepted the two value-return forms the oracle raises ERROR 021 on, and refused with ERROR 239 the NRETURN
# form the oracle accepts -- and pinning that behaviour here would have converted a documented gap into a
# green gate that must be edited before the cure could land: a test that defends a bug.
# ✅ THE INVERSION IS CURED (hq_P 2026-09-06, same row) and its end state is pinned by its OWN gate,
# test_gate_sno_goto_field_call_is_by_name.sh -- NRETURN name is the target, a value return raises ERROR 021,
# both modes. The split still stands on purpose: THIS gate stays parse-only, so a parser regression and a
# semantics regression cannot present as one red. Keep the two separate.
#
# ⭐ THE THIRD CASE IS THE ONE NOBODY WOULD THINK TO WRITE, so it is here on purpose: a user function named
# S or F. The lexer's <GT>[Ss]/"(" and <GT>[Ff]/"(" rules returned the success/failure goto markers at ANY
# paren depth, so :(F()) lexed F as T_GOTO_F and the construct was unreachable for those two names alone.
# Found only because the first hand-probe happened to be called F. Now guarded on gt_depth > 0.
#
# EXIT: 0 every form parses in both modes. 1 a form regressed to a parse error. 2 UNPROVEN (no built scrip).
