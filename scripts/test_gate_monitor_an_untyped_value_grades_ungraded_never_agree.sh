# ⛔ THE DEFECT THIS GRADES (the cfo, CFO-152, 2026-09-23 07:4x; row monitor-the-controller-reads-an-untyped-value-as-agree-so-a-
# wrong-rat-passes-ungraded-is-a-named-count-never-a-match, dispatched to the coo by the ceo 13:4x). monitor_sync_bin.py's
# keys_match WILDCARDED type AND value bytes whenever either side sent MWT_UNKNOWN, so the pair read AGREE with nothing compared.
# rkx sends a Rat as UNKNOWN with no bytes, so a WRONG SCRIP Rat read AGREE; SPITBOL sends every TABLE, ARRAY, PATTERN, NAME,
# CODE and EXPRESSION as UNKNOWN, so anything SCRIP stored there read AGREE too, and monitor_run.sh then printed "agree
# event-for-event" over a run it had not measured. That is a property of every participant on the wire, not of Rakudo.
# ⭐ THE MEASURED RED, before the cure (SCRIP fb57f00ba): the committed witness scripts/monitor/witnesses/sync_step_snobol4.sno
# read "[monitor_run] AGREE: participants spl scr agree event-for-event, clean termination at step 41" -- the cured controller
# reads it AGREE=39 DIVERGE=0 UNGRADED=2 (t: spl UNKNOWN | scr TABLE; a: spl UNKNOWN | scr ARRAY). Fail-once/pass-once receipt:
# the Makefile line that wires this gate.
#
# THE ARMS. 1-6 are HERMETIC: two synthetic participants speak the binary wire (13-byte header, NAME_DEF interning, one ack per
# record, END unacked -- monitor_ipc_lib.c's protocol) to the REAL controller, so no oracle, no build and no corpus is read.
#   1  THE ROW'S WITNESS: the oracle sends VALUE r UNKNOWN (a Rat, no bytes), SCRIP a WRONG REAL -> rc 0 and VERDICT
#      AGREE=3 DIVERGE=0 UNGRADED=1 of 4, r named. The pre-cure controller printed no VERDICT and read the run as AGREE.
#   2  the mirror: the untyped value on SCRIP's side -> UNGRADED=1 as well (either side, never only the oracle's).
#   3  an UNGRADED step before a real divergence is marked (u) in the grid, never shown as an agreed row, and counted.
#   4  kind and name are STILL graded under UNKNOWN: VALUE r UNKNOWN against VALUE s REAL diverges (rc 1).
#   5  a typed wrong value still diverges (REAL 1/3 against REAL 0.25) -- the cure loosened nothing.
#   6  a fully typed agreeing run reads AGREE=4 UNGRADED=0, so AGREE is a counted verdict too, not a silence.
#   Every VERDICT line is also checked for its identity AGREE + DIVERGE + UNGRADED == compared steps.
#   7  END TO END through the one command an HQ uses: monitor_run.sh <T = TABLE()> --oracle (spl scr) prints UNGRADED=1 naming
#      T and never "[monitor_run] AGREE:". Needs the SPITBOL fork and a fresh scrip; missing either is UNPROVEN (rc 2).
# GATE_MONITOR_CTRL overrides the controller arms 1-6 run (for the fail-once proof against a pre-cure copy).
