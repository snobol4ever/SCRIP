# test_gate_icn_argcheck_filter_admits_every_table_row.sh -- the two-byte rejection filter in front of
# core_icn_builtin_argcheck() (src/runtime/core/core.c) must NEVER reject a name the table would have matched.
#
# WHY THIS GATE EXISTS. argcheck used to walk all 17 table rows on EVERY strict builtin call; the walk was
# 26.75M of its 28.85M Ir on the deal benchmark (92.7% of the function), because the hot Icon names all share
# their FIRST byte with a table row -- map/move, write/where, left/left, push/pos, string/seek -- so an earlier
# 256-entry first-byte filter rejected NOTHING and measured as no change at all. The cure keys on TWO bytes.
#
# WHAT COULD GO WRONG, AND IT IS THE ONLY THING THAT COULD. The filter is a 64-bit bloom over (c0,c1). A false
# POSITIVE is harmless -- the row scan runs exactly as before and decides. A false NEGATIVE would silently skip
# an argument type check, turning a required runtime error into a wrong answer. The rows and the mask are
# generated from ONE macro list (ICN_ARGCHK_ROWS) precisely so they cannot drift apart, but the per-row key
# CHARS are written beside each name by hand -- 'trim','t','r' -- and C offers no way to assert at compile time
# that 't','r' really are "trim"[0] and "trim"[1] (a string-literal subscript is not a constant expression;
# _Static_assert rejects it). So that one hand-written pairing is the live drift hazard, and this gate is what
# stands under it.
#
# HOW IT CHECKS: it lifts the REAL macro block out of core.c -- never a copy kept in this file, which would
# drift in exactly the way the gate exists to catch -- splices it into a harness, and proves two things by
# execution: (1) every row's c0/c1 equal the first two bytes of that row's own string literal, and
# (2) exhaustively over all 65,280 two-byte prefixes, every prefix any row matches is admitted by the mask.
