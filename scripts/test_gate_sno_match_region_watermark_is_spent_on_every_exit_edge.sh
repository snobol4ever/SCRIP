# A match region opened INSIDE A PROCEDURE must have its watermark spent on EVERY edge that leaves the region, not
# only on the edge the statement happens to end on.  zd_exit_pop_s (src/emitter/emit.cpp) applies the close-tracker
# correction only when the exit node is IR_STATEMENT_END / IR_STATEMENT / IR_GOTO_DEFERRED; every other terminal path
# node gets `full`, which OVER-POPS by the match-region interior carve that MATCH_END has already whacked.
#
# ⛔⭐ THE CLASS THIS INSTRUMENT CAN ELIMINATE IN, DECLARED HERE BECAUSE AN UNDECLARED CLASS IS THE DEFECT THIS ROW
# EXISTS BESIDE.  It grades ONE construct family: a match used as an if/while CONDITION inside a procedure, left by
# a named set of edges.  Its green says NOTHING about match regions left by any edge not listed below, about matches
# outside a procedure, or about any other frontend.  The sibling gate
# test_gate_sn4_replacement_releases_its_post_match_spine.sh was green and honest on the tree that first shipped this
# defect, because every one of ITS witnesses leaves by FALL-THROUGH -- an honest instrument with an undeclared class
# is caught by nobody, since every reader who checks it finds it telling the truth about a population they were never
# given the boundary of.  So: the boundary is the EXIT EDGE, and it is named per arm.
#
# ⛔ GRADED ON OUTPUT, NEVER ON rc.  The survivors exit rc=2 (silent), rc=2 and rc=139, so an instrument keyed on
# rc=139 sees a third of the population and reads the rest as a different class or as passing (hq_I, measured).
# ⛔ EXPECTATIONS ARE PINNED, NOT CUT FROM AN ORACLE, and that is a real weakness stated rather than hidden: there is
# no Snocone oracle binary (sbl runs SPITBOL, not this syntax), so scripts/test_smoke_snocone.sh pins its expectations
# inline too and this follows that convention.  Each value below is what the construct must mean, cross-checked
# against hq_I's six-witness table measured on both sides of SCRIP 152461d75.
#
# ✅ CURED AND WIRED.  Owner: hq_U.  Row:
# snocone-the-match-region-watermark-is-spent-on-one-edge-so-non-local-exits-out-of-the-region-overpop (rank 0).
# It landed RED 6/9 at SCRIP 910f27184 -- deliberately UNWIRED, because a red gate in the blocking set is a broken
# build for every seat -- and is wired into `make test` HERE, BY THE CURE, per CEO-381.  A gate that lands red with
# an owner and a row named in its own header is a debt with a due date; one that lands red with neither is a line
# every seat learns to ignore.
#
# ⭐ FAIL-ONCE/PASS-ONCE IS PROVEN ON ONE BINARY, NOT BY STASH-AND-REBUILD: the cure carries the killswitch
# SCRIP_ZD_CLOSE=0, so `SCRIP_ZD_CLOSE=0 bash $0` reproduces 6/9 with the same three arms red and `bash $0`
# reads 9/9, from the same ./scrip.  ⛔ THE KILLSWITCH IS A MEASUREMENT INSTRUMENT, NOT A SUPPORTED CONFIGURATION:
# nothing may depend on the OFF position, which is the retired behaviour and is kept only so the next reader can
# re-derive the delta without owning a second tree.
