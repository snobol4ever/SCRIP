# scorecard_snobol4.sh's probes_misc row globs `$CORPUS/probe -name *.sno -not -path */bb/*` -- a converted
# probe family (probe/<family> loose files -> tests/snobol4/probe/<family>.{sno,ref}, corpus-suites-consolidation's
# probe-consolidate-* rows) moves OUT of that root into a sibling root the glob never reaches. `run_one`'s own
# SUITE-FILE GUARD also refuses to grade a suite .sno whole (it is a container, not a program), so simply widening
# the glob is not a fix either -- it needs its ENTRY count. Measured live 2026-08-27 (seat15,
# .github/FINDING-2026-08-27-seat15-probe-conformance-already-shrank-probes-misc-fuzz-stays-blocked.md):
# `probe-consolidate-conformance` had already landed and cost 92 witnesses, silently, uncorrected.
# This gate CONSTRUCTS that exact condition hermetically -- a scratch corpus with ONE loose probe witness
# (findable today, the sanity anchor) plus ONE converted suite family of 3 entries sitting where real
# conversions land (tests/snobol4/probe/), all green -- and asserts probes_misc's reported denominator and
# pass counts include the suite's entries, not just the loose file. TWO-PART PROOF (RULES.md): run this against
# the unfixed script first and confirm it goes RED (N=1, the 3 entries invisible) before curing
# scorecard_snobol4.sh, then confirm GREEN after (N=4, P3=P4=4) -- both halves were run by hand while writing
# this gate; only the property check itself is committed, same shape as
# test_gate_crosscheck_family_list_autodiscovers.sh's sibling gate for the crosscheck/ side of this fan-out.
