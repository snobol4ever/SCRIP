# test_gate_xfail_marker_and_index_agree.sh -- THE XFAIL MARKER AND THE INDEX MUST NAME THE SAME ENTRIES.
# (hq_T 2026-09-05, row test-suite-consistency-seven-languages-one-standard; the half of
# FINDING-2026-09-05-hq_T-every-xfail-promotion-leaves-the-master-unsorted-and-the-csv-stale that had no guard.)
#
# ⛔ WHAT BREAKS IT IS A PROMOTION, AND IT BROKE FIVE TIMES IN ONE DAY. An XFAIL lives in THREE places: the
# banner in the master itself, the `xfail` column of ALL.csv, and the reason line in ALL.xfail. A promotion
# rewrites the master and the reasons file and LEAVES THE INDEX AT 1. Measured at corpus 5df255b01:
# ALL.sno carried 46 banners while ALL.csv still called 49 entries xfail -- and nothing was inconsistent in a
# way any gate could see, because every gate compared a file with ITSELF. The suite and its index agreed on
# every other column; the marker gates were green; the order gate caught the ORDER half and said nothing
# about this one.
# ⭐ THE RULE THIS ASSERTS: when one fact is stored in three representations, the guard belongs on the
# AGREEMENT, never on any single one of them. Neither file is wrong on its own terms -- they are wrong
# relative to each other, which is a property no single-file check can hold.
#
# ⛔⛔ COMMENT SYNTAX IS PER-LANGUAGE AND A SNOBOL4-SHAPED MATCHER SILENTLY READS ZERO. Measured while
# writing this gate, and it is the reason the regex below leads with \W* instead of a literal '*':
# snobol4 banners are `*--- N name XFAIL`, raku's are `#--- ...`, snocone's are `/*--- ... */`. A `^\*-`
# pattern reports raku as 0 banners against 156 index rows -- a 156-entry catastrophe that does not exist,
# and it would have been filed as one. A census instrument written in one language's punctuation answers
# "how many does MY dialect have", never "how many are there".
