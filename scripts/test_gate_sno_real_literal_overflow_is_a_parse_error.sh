# ✅ GREEN, AND WIRED INTO `make test` IN THE SAME COMMIT THAT CURED THE DEFECT (2026-09-16, hq_snobol4).
# A SNOBOL4 REAL LITERAL THAT OVERFLOWS DOUBLE used to hand back the IEEE infinity as an ordinary value:
# X = 1.797693135E+308 printed `inf`, and SNOBOL4 has no infinity. The lexer converted with atof(), which
# reports nothing at all. SPITBOL REJECTS THE PROGRAM AT COMPILE TIME -- ERROR 231 "syntax error: invalid
# numeric item" -- so no code is generated and nothing runs. Row: snobol4-a-real-that-overflows-yields-inf-
# as-a-value-where-spitbol-fails. Cure: src/parsers/snobol4/snobol4.l, one authority, strtod + isfinite.
#
# ⛔ THE ORACLE'S ANSWER IS A COMPILE-TIME REFUSAL, NOT A RUNTIME STATEMENT FAILURE, AND THAT DISTINCTION IS
# THE WHOLE GATE. The row's minted DONE-WHEN expects `lit=failed` -- i.e. the :F() branch taken at run time --
# which the oracle NEVER produces: it never runs the program at all. That .ref was cut from an assumption
# rather than from the oracle. This gate measures what the oracle actually does. See the baton's LEDGER.
#
# ⭐ IT HAS CONTROL ARMS ON PURPOSE, AND THEY ARE THE POINT: the cure must reject ONLY what overflows.
# 1.797693134E+308 is just under DBL_MAX and MUST still compile and print -- an over-eager check that
# rejected the whole large-exponent range would pass a naive "does it refuse?" test while breaking real
# programs. Each arm is compared against the live oracle in this same run, never against a pinned string.
