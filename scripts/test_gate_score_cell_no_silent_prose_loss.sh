# test_gate_score_cell_no_silent_prose_loss.sh -- the invariant gate for cell_prose_loss (row
# score-md-runners-rewrite-a-cell-in-place-and-silently-discard-the-prose-they-never-modelled, hq_B mint
# 2026-09-04T00:36:35Z off hq_B's 2026-09-03 ICN4 finding).
#
# WHAT IT PROTECTS. Two independent code sites replace a SCORE.md cell wholesale --
# util_score_row.py:cmd_write's no-suite path (`cells[idx] = text`, ~17 runners including
# test_corpus_snobol4.sh and board_icon_master.sh) and util_apply_score_grid.py:apply_grid
# (`cells[di] = new`, the September-10-grid merge). Both can silently discard whatever hand-written prose
# a human appended to a cell and no runner ever modelled, WITH THE MEASURED NUMBERS UNCHANGED -- so
# nothing about the diff looks wrong. Measured live, .github 46ff295c: test_corpus_snobol4.sh dropped
# hq_P's re-confirmation sentence from the snobol4 board cell while the fraction it replaced (1689/1689
# FAIL=0) was byte-identical before and after. Repaired by hand; this gate is what stops it recurring.
#
# ⛔ AND THE OTHER DIRECTION, EQUALLY: the SAME repair shows a runner's own boilerplate drifting in
# punctuation between two captures with no human involved ("SKIP=0 · MISSING=0" became "SKIP=0
# MISSING=0"; a comma moved beside a citation backtick). A guard that also flags that reformatting is
# noisy enough that nobody keeps it turned on -- so this gate proves BOTH: the real sentence loss is
# caught, and the real boilerplate drift from the SAME commit is not.
#
# ⭐ PRESERVE-OR-REFUSE, RULED, THEN REFINED (row score-writer-models-the-snobol4-board-cell-so-the-runner-
# can-write-it). hq_T ruled REFUSE on 2026-09-04 against a SILENT merge: carrying an old caveat forward as
# though it still describes the new measurement, when its truth-relationship to that number is unknown by
# construction (the real Raku incident this file's header names). util_apply_score_grid.py:apply_grid
# still does exactly that -- it REFUSES (rc=1 for the batch, skipping only the at-risk cell so one risky
# row cannot abort the rest of a merge) and that call site is UNCHANGED by this refinement.
# ⛔ util_score_row.py:cmd_write's no-`--suite` path no longer refuses on prose loss -- it FOLDS the old
# reading forward instead, labelled: `<new text> SUPERSEDE_MARKER <old text, byte-for-byte>`. This is
# deliberately NOT the "preserve" hq_T ruled against: it never asserts `before` is still true, it demotes
# it to "the reading THIS one supersedes" -- the same move every hand-edit of the snobol4 board/entries
# cells already made, mechanized. Carrying `before` forward verbatim also makes loss structurally
# impossible (cmd_write re-proves this with cell_prose_loss on its own output before writing), which is
# why a fold-forward is available here at all where apply_grid's batch merge has no such proof available
# per-cell without becoming this same function. Full reasoning: SUPERSEDE_MARKER's comment in
# util_score_row.py and this row's QA -- this is a seat's reading of an HQ ruling, surfaced back to hq_T
# for review, not a unilateral re-ruling of it.
#
# ⛔ IT GRADES SCRATCH COPIES, NEVER THE REAL BOARD -- both selftests copy .github/SCORE.md to a tempdir
# and write there; this gate asserts that too (the real .github working tree must be no dirtier after the
# run than before), same discipline as the sibling gate on this file, and for the same reason: a gate
# that edits the artifact it grades is how a green board and a corrupted file coexist.
