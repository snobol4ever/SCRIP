# (CEO-1477; ARCH-PROLOG-C-OUT-OF-THE-BOX.md section 3). ARM 1: zebra.pl and crypt.pl compiled to mode-4 text name no rt_pl_dop_mkc -- the
# $mkc box allocates its argument block with one rt_gcheap_alloc, stores the result cell before the poll, and writes the functor and the kids
# itself (an unbound kid: a fresh self-reference in the block, the variable's cell bound to it under the trail test). ARMS 2-7: six witnesses
# against swipl in m3 AND m4: bound kids and a nested list tail, unbound kids bound later and read back, the trail (a structure binding undone
# by failure, in a clause and in a disjunction), a 20000-cell list built tail-recursively (the allocator's slow path and the collector under
# the box), a 16-argument compound with a late-bound kid read back through =.., and sharing (findall, one variable in two terms, nested terms,
# copy_term). The expected text is the oracle's, cut with /usr/bin/swipl -q -t halt at gate-writing time.
# ARM 8, w_order (row prolog-bb-a-term-built-over-an-unbound-heap-variable-links-to-it-never-rebinds-it-so-the-standard-order-of-variables-holds, re-minted per
# CEO-1511): an unbound kid already on the heap is LINKED from the new block, never rebound, so two variables keep their standard order however many
# terms are built over them (r(f(M,N),R1), r(f(N,M),R2) gives R1 \== R2; msort of the same two variables in either order is one list). RED on origin
# a6b90f22e in both modes: two of its checks read no.
# RED BEFORE on origin 35ed4e649: arm 1 names rt_pl_dop_mkc (zebra 38 sites, crypt 37); the witnesses pass there (they are the behaviour the
# box must keep), so the gate's FAIL-ONCE is arm 1.
