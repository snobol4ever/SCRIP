# test_gate_sno_rewind_on_an_unopened_unit_raises_174.sh -- REWIND(N) on a unit with no OPENed file raises
# ERROR 174 in BOTH modes, and the output produced before the raise survives it.
#
# ⛔⭐ THIS GATE EXISTS BECAUSE THE CURE FOR THIS DEFECT LANDED WITH NO INSTRUMENT AND THE BOARD DID NOT
# MOVE. hq_R found it (_REWIND_ fell back to stdin for unit 5 instead of raising), probed it four ways
# against sbl, cured it -- and csnobol4_suite/rewind1 went FAIL to REJECT and stayed red, because its .ref
# is a transcript of SPITBOL's OWN fatal termination (memory used/left, REGENERATIONS, stmts executed,
# execution time) which no implementation produces by being correct. A correct cure on a dead-pinned
# program cannot flip it; test_gate_no_ref_pins_oracle_internal_state.sh names the class and rewind1 was
# the last member of it still inside a graded denominator (ceo CEO-724). THE SEMANTIC MOVES HERE SO THAT
# LEAVING THE DENOMINATOR COSTS NO COVERAGE -- an exclusion that drops a behaviour nobody re-checks is the
# expensive mistake this file is written to prevent.
#
# ⭐ THE EXPECTATION IS CUT FROM sbl -bf AT RUN TIME AND COMPARED THROUGH THE ONE ERROR VOICE (RULES.md
# § ONE ERROR VOICE, ceo CEO-623/625): the runtime prints its own SCRIP-shaped error for every language and
# never an oracle's shape, so the captured stream is rendered by util_render_error_voice.py spitbol and the
# oracle's own ERROR line is what it is diffed against. Measured: the rendered line is BYTE-IDENTICAL to
# the oracle's. What is NOT graded here, deliberately, is SPITBOL's termination accounting -- that is the
# very thing the ref pinned and the very thing we must never print.
#
# THE ARMS:
#   1  the oracle raises 174 on this witness            (cut at run time -- refuses if it does not)
#   2  m3 raises 174, rendered line identical to arm 1
#   3  m4 raises 174, rendered line identical to arm 1
#   4  m3 keeps the two lines it printed BEFORE the raise
#   5  m4 keeps the two lines it printed BEFORE the raise
#   6  DETECTOR -- the same witness with the REWIND removed raises NOTHING in either mode, so arms 2 and 3
#      are discriminating and not a grep that matches anything
# EXIT: 0 all arms pass · 1 an arm failed · 2 REFUSED (no binary, no oracle, oracle shape moved).
