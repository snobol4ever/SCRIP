"""THE PER-WITNESS RATCHET of the unmapped-store class: reads a census run on stdin, grades it against a baseline.

⛔ WHY THIS IS NOT A TOTAL (hq_snobol4, 2026-09-20, measured against the gate BEFORE landing rather than discovered
afterwards).  The census's population is a DIRECTORY GLOB over scripts/gc_witnesses.  Nine oracle-cut witnesses
arriving from another seat's row would move the total from 162 to 192, and a total-shaped arm prints THE CLASS
GREW and names a compiler regression it never measured -- over nine files that had just been added.  A total
cannot tell a compiler regression from a file arriving.  Only a name set can, and that is this row's own
NAME-NEVER-A-COUNT rule applied one level down from where the census first applied it.

THE THREE VERDICTS ARE DIFFERENT FACTS AND ARE NEVER SUMMED: MOVED is a witness whose OWN reading changed, which
is the thing the row exists to catch; GONE is a baseline line whose witness left the population, so the floor is
grading something it can no longer see; NEW is a file addition, which must be recorded but is NOT a regression and
must not be reported as one.

THE FIFTH COLUMN, ADDED 2026-09-20 BY THE cto: stores shielded at a safe point into a FIXED SYMBOL instead
of into the frame.  It is ratcheted for a reason the other four cannot express -- when shielding MOVES from
the road this census grades to the road it does not, `members` and `shielded` both FALL and every arm reads
an improvement, while the truth is that coverage was lost."""
