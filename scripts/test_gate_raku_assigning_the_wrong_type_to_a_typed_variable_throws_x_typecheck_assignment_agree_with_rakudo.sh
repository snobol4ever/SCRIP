# test_gate_raku_assigning_the_wrong_type_to_a_typed_variable_throws_x_typecheck_assignment_agree_with_rakudo.sh -- `my Int $i = 5; $i = "a"` THROWS X::TypeCheck::Assignment, ALSO FOR A TYPED ARRAY ELEMENT, push AND A HASH VALUE
# (row raku-every-suite-to-100-under-nonet-ceo-1266; found by classifying the throws-like cases of Roast (X::TypeCheck::Assignment is in 45 of them, 104 files declare `my Int` / `my Str` / `my Num`) and by probing: a typed declaration was recorded and never enforced).
#
# THE DEFECT, measured against Rakudo: `my Int $i = 5; try { $i = "a"; CATCH { default { say .^name } } }` printed nothing: the assignment succeeded (same for Str, Num, Bool, a user class, `my Int @a; @a[0] = "z"`, `@a.push("q")` and `my Int %h; %h<b> = "x"`), and `say "x".WHAT` ... a typed declaration only fixed the name in the tree.
# THE CURE: (lower_raku.c rk_typed_vars, a pass before the others) a lexical-scope walk over the tree that remembers `my T $x` / `my T @a` / `my T %h` for T in Int, Str, Num, Bool or a class or role the program declares (never a type scrip cannot judge: Rat, Numeric, Real, Cool, Any, subsets, ...), forgets it when the enclosing block, sub or sequence ends, and wraps the right-hand side of the declaration's initializer, of a later `$x = ...` and of `@a[i] = ...` / `%h<k> = ...` / `@a.push(...)` / append / unshift / prepend in __rk_assign_check; (by_name_dispatch.c) the check passes an undefined value (Nil) and anything whose type isa the declared one (Bool isa Int), and otherwise throws X::TypeCheck::Assignment (attributes got, expected, symbol) with Rakudo's message `Type check failed in assignment to $i; expected Int but got Str ("a")` or `Type check failed for an element of @a; ...`; .raku of a Num carries Rakudo's e0 (5.5e0) and of a type object is its name, which that message needs; the prefix `~` of an Int answers a Str (it answered the Int).
# NOT HERE (own rows, measured): a parameter's type on assignment (parameters are read-only in Rakudo), `my Int $i;` holding the (Int) type object instead of Nil, a return type (`--> Int`: X::TypeCheck::Return), `of` and subset constraints, `my Rat $r = 0.5` (Rat is not enforced: decimal literals are Num here), an inner untyped `my $i` that shadows a typed outer `$i` of the same name (scrip keeps one variable per name per routine, so the check still applies to it), Nil assigned through a list ('' for Nil in a list), `my Int $i = Nil` resetting to the type object.
# THE WITNESS (cut by the INSTALLED Rakudo 2022.12), graded in m3 (--run) and m4 (--compile + link), then under SCRIP_GC_STRESS 1 3 5 in both modes. It also holds ordinary integer-producing expressions assigned to `my Int` (div, %, abs, floor, "42".Int, +"17", **, elems, ord, chars) and Str-producing ones (~, x, Str, join, uc) to prove the check raises no false error.
# FAILED ONCE, measured on the sitting's control build cfcfaf46d: the type errors are never raised (the witness differs on its error lines).
#
# EXIT: 0 every witness matches in both modes; 1 a mismatch or a crash on a witness; 2 REFUSED (stale binary, no gcc).
