#
# MEASURED 2026-09-12 on f8421f4bd: `every 1 to 3000000 do image("ab\tcd")` reached 564 MB RSS in both modes -- the first
# regeneration fired only when the 512 MB arena was exhausted (the seam-side line sat at half the arena and the assembly
# fast path carved inline against the arena END, never seeing any line), so a program with a few KB of live data touched
# every page of the arena and CEO-605's micro.icn aborted on the pinned-allocation ceiling. Cure: the collection line sits
# min(128 MB, half of what remains) past the top (SCRIP_GC_LINE_MB, default 128 -- 64 cost ~60% wall on the churniest Icon
# benchmark, 128 reads at parity with the old policy; 0 = the old half-of-arena seam policy), the
# fast region carries that line at offset 48 and rtx_alloc.s carves inline only up to it, and c_rt_gcheap_alloc collects
# at the line through the same conservative path exhaustion already used. Arms: (1) the churning witness stays under
# 256 MB RSS (the row's own bound) in mode 3 and mode 4 and prints ok; (2) CONTROL: SCRIP_GC_LINE_MB=0 reproduces the old behaviour, RSS above
# 400 MB -- the control arm proves the pacing is what bounds the RSS and that the seam still selects the old policy.
# FAIL_ONCE=1 plants the control arm's RSS into arm 1 to prove the bound trips.

# ⛔⭐ THIS GATE NAMES ITS OWN ARENA, AND THAT IS THE RULE, NOT AN EXEMPTION (Lon 2026-09-19, ceo CEO-938; RULES.md
# § THE INSTRUMENT LAWS, TWENTY-EIGHTH BATCH CLAUSE 2).  The tiny arena is the default of all GC testing and the Makefile
# exports SCRIP_HEAP_MB=1 to every gate run through make -- but THIS gate measures an arena-dependent quantity: the
# pacing line is min(SCRIP_GC_LINE_MB, half of what remains) past the top and both arms grade RSS against a 256 MB bound
# calibrated at the shipped 512 MB window.  At a 1 MB window the program collects every megabyte, RSS never approaches
# the bound, the control arm stops discriminating and the gate reads FAIL for a reason that is not the thing it tests
# (measured: FAIL under an inherited SCRIP_HEAP_MB=1, PASS at 512).  So it pins the arena it was calibrated at, in the
# open, where a reader sees it.  A gate that measures an arena-dependent quantity does the same; one that does not must
# NOT pin, because inheriting the tiny arena is how the fleet finds collector defects in every other gate.
