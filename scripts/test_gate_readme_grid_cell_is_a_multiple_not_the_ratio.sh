# test_gate_readme_grid_cell_is_a_multiple_not_the_ratio.sh -- A PUBLISHED GRID CELL IS THE MULTIPLE ITS CITED TSV GIVES, NEVER
# THE TSV's SELF-AGREEMENT RATIO (coo 2026-09-16; cfo's mint from hq_pascal's measurement; row perf-a-published-grid-cell-must-
# come-from-the-grid-printer-a-gate-reads-each-cited-tsv-and-refuses-a-cell-equal-to-the-ratio-field-not-the-multiple).
#
# THE DEFECT: all eight Pascal cells published in README.md at a44783caf equalled the RATIO column (angle2/angle1, near 1.0 by
# construction) of the run they cited, corpus/benchmarks/pascal/triangulation-20260904T021323Z.tsv, while that run's true
# multiples against fpc were 0.000675x to 0.03x; retracted by the ceo (CEO-798). Every instrument was honest; the COPYING step
# -- a seat pasting a column instead of a printed grid -- had no instrument asserting about it. This gate is that instrument.
#
# WHAT IT READS: every markdown grid row `| <kernel> | **N.NNx** | **N.NNx** |` (m3, m4) in README.md whose section (the text
# since the previous '## ' heading) cites a triangulation-*.tsv. From that TSV (kernel, engine, angle1_rate, angle2_rate, ratio,
# verdict): the MULTIPLE for engine m3/m4 is its angle1_rate over the reference engine's (fpc, sbl, iconx... -- the row that is\n# neither m3 nor m4) angle1_rate; the RATIO is the engine row's own
# ratio field. A cell equal (to two decimals) to the ratio and not to the multiple is REFUSED, by kernel and column.
#
# VERDICT: rc=0 with the population printed (cells graded; a kernel absent from its own cited TSV is UNVERIFIABLE, printed, not\n# red; zero graded is printed as zero, never as a pass of something); rc=1 on
# a ratio cell; rc=2 when a cited TSV is missing or unreadable. --selftest plants a README fragment and a TSV with one ratio cell
# and one multiple cell and proves rc=1 naming the ratio cell, then rc=0 once it is the multiple. FAIL_ONCE=1 corrupts the
# selftest's planted multiple cell into the ratio to prove the arm trips.
