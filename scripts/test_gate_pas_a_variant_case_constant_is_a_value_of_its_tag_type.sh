# test_gate_pas_a_variant_case_constant_is_a_value_of_its_tag_type.sh -- ISO 7185 6.4.3.3, refused at compile time
#
# MEASURED 2026-09-23 by hq_pascal on SCRIP 2441f7be7, both modes, row pascal-all-test-suites-of-the-language-read-100-percent-on-the-
# suite-table-the-home-stretch (class row pascal-pat-variant-record-active-tag-tracking). "The values denoted by all case-constants of
# a type that is required to be compatible with a given tag-type shall be distinct and the set thereof shall be equal to the set of
# values specified by the tag-type" (6.4.3.3). record_case_arm discarded its constants, so PAT iso7185prt1857 (tag-type two..four with
# an arm labelled five) compiled and ran. record_case_arm now yields its constant list and record_case_list collects them, threaded
# through yacc values with no new state; at record_case_opt a constant outside the tag-type, or one value named twice, is refused.
# The tag-type is checked when it resolves to Boolean, an enumerated type or a subrange of at most 4096 values; integer and char
# tag-types are left alone.
#
# ⛔ THE OTHER HALF OF THE SAME SENTENCE IS NOT HERE, AND IT IS HELD FOR A RULING, NOT FORGOTTEN: "equal to the set of values" also
# refuses a variant-part that OMITS a value (PAT iso7185prt1856). Measured with that half enabled: Pascal-P4 comp.pas (the where,
# attrkind and vaccess variants), int.pas (datatype), the P4-derived pcom.pas and pint.pas, and TWO MASTER ENTRIES
# (program_record_array_replace_2, program_record_packed_replace_1, both P4-shaped fragments) are refused -- fpc -Miso accepts all of
# them, and upstream Pascal-P5 itself ADDED a blck: arm to P4's where variant to satisfy this rule (P5 pcom.pas line 517). Asked the
# ceo, with the master edits and a P4 PATCHES item proposed; until the ruling, 1856 stays red and named.
# Before landing, every acceptance program in the corpus (PasM, the FPC suite, P4, P5, the benchmarks, 456 programs) was compiled
# with the check: the refused set was identical to the tree before.
#
# ARMS: one vendored PAT witness, required to be REFUSED with a non-empty diagnostic in BOTH modes (m4 compiles, and if the compile is
# accepted, links and runs). A second arm proves the check DISCRIMINATES: variant-parts over enumerated, Boolean and subrange tag-types,
# with a tag-field and without, with constant lists, run byte-identical to fpc -Miso in both modes. FAIL_ONCE=1 flips the witness.
