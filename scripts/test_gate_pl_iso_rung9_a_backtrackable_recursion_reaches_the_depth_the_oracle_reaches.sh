#
# PROLOG ISO LADDER, RUNG 9 -- THE FRAME. A recursion whose calls leave a CHOICEPOINT must reach the depth
# the oracle reaches. Today it does not: a deterministic recursion runs to 200,000 levels and beyond, while a
# backtrackable one dies at ~29,000 on the default 8 MB stack, and the canonical Takeuchi kernel cannot run at
# its published size at all.
#
# ⛔ THE CLASS IS CAPACITY, NOT CORRECTNESS, AND THAT IS WHAT MAKES IT A FRAME DEFECT RATHER THAN AN ENGINE
# ONE. Every answer SCRIP produces here is RIGHT: tak(16,11,6,A) yields 11 and tak(18,12,6,A) yields 7 under a
# larger stack, both matching swipl. Nothing is mis-executed; the machine simply runs out of room at a size
# the oracle handles without comment. A gate that only graded answers would read this whole class as green.
#
# ⭐ THE TWO ARMS ARE A CONTRAST, AND THE CONTRAST IS THE FINDING -- neither arm means anything alone:
#   DET arm: p(N) :- N > 0, N1 is N-1, p(N1).           deterministic, 200,000 levels, PASSES TODAY.
#   CP  arm: p(N) :- N > 0, q(_), N1 is N-1, p(N1).     q/1 has two clauses, so every level retains a
#                                                        choicepoint. Dies between 28,000 and 30,000.
# Same shape, same depth, one extra goal. So this is NOT "deep recursion is expensive" -- deterministic frames
# ARE reclaimed and the last-call path works. It is that A FRAME BEHIND A CHOICEPOINT IS NEVER RECLAIMED and
# costs machine stack that is neither growable nor compact. The DET arm is therefore a mandatory CONTROL: if
# it ever goes red the cure has traded one capacity for another, which is not a cure.
#
# ⛔ MEASURED COST, because a rung should carry a number and not an adjective (cto 2026-09-13, default 8 MB):
#   simple CP witness  ~8.4 MB / ~29,000 levels   = ~289 BYTES per retained frame
#   tak(18,12,6)       ~200 MB / ~63,609 calls    = ~3.1 KB per retained frame
# The tak figure is the honest one for real code: its clause 1 (X =< Y) stays retryable at every level, so
# NOT ONE of its ~63,609 frames is ever reclaimed, and four arguments plus three intermediates make each frame
# an order of magnitude larger than the toy's. swipl runs the same program in a few MB because its
# choicepoints are compact records on a growable heap stack. Ours are machine-stack frames, by design
# (ARCH-ENGINE, the three zetas), and this rung is where that design first costs a real program.
#
# ⛔ THE STACK SIZE IS PART OF THE MEASUREMENT AND THE GATE PINS IT. Run under whatever `ulimit -s` the shell
# happens to carry and this gate grades the shell, not the compiler: tak(18,12,6) FAILS at 8/64/128 MB and
# PASSES at 256 MB, so an unpinned run can report either verdict truthfully. It therefore sets its own limit
# in a subshell and PRINTS it, and refuses rc=2 if it cannot.
#
# DONE-WHEN (all three, BOTH MODES, at the pinned default 8 MB):
#   1. DET control  p(200000)      completes                 -- passes today, must never regress
#   2. CP arm       p(100000)      completes                 -- red today (dies ~29,000)
#   3. tak(18,12,6,A) yields A = 7                           -- red today (needs ~256 MB)
# EXIT 0 all green; 1 the rung is not yet met (names which arm); 2 REFUSED (cannot measure).
