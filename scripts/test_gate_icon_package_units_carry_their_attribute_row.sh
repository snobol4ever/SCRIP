export S4E_ONE_RUNNER_FIXTURE="gate arm ${0##*/}: a runner invoked as an instrument fixture over scratch packages outside corpus, not a board (CEO-547)"
# test_gate_icon_package_units_carry_their_attribute_row.sh -- EVERY UNIT THE THREE ICON PACKAGE RUNNERS LOOK UP HAS ITS ROW, A DRIVER'S
# UNDER ITS LIBRARY'S KEY, AND A UNIT WITH NONE IS NAMED BY THE RUNNER. RULES.md hard-cap rule clause 8 (f) (ceo CEO-1281): "A
# declaration that is missing is a gap the runner names, never a default silently taken."
#
# ⛔⭐ WHY (coo 2026-09-27, on hq_icon's ask of where IPL iftrace's --stlimit lives): corpus 4d805e1bc (2026-09-25) gave every unit the
# runners looked up a row, read off SCRIP_DECL_MISS_LOG over one full pass. The drivers of CEO-1269/1272 came after it, and nothing
# re-read: 382 graded units had no row (IPL 356 -- all 340 driver-graded libraries and 16 progs graded through argv, dat or fixtures
# sidecars -- Arizona 23, Jcon 3) and 275 more IPL files the compile tier looks up. SCRIP 286483382 (compile_args landing 3) then
# stopped the runners typing --stlimit for every program, proven on the compile tier alone, which walks no driver; from 2026-09-26
# 23:01Z the 382 ran with no declared switch, heap or stack, and no line of any board said so, because every lookup answers "nothing
# declared" alike for a row that declares nothing and for no row at all, and _decl_miss logged only when a variable was set. And the
# Jcon runner looked a driver's attributes up under the DRIVER's name ("link2_driver"), a row no table carries.
#
#   W   PREMISE: the witness driver's output is a trace, so it equals the Icon oracle's with --stlimit and differs without it, in both
#       modes, in each runner's own invocation. ⛔ THE TRACED PROCEDURE LIVES IN THE FILE WHOSE NAME SCRIP PRINTS IN THAT INVOCATION:
#       a trace line carries its procedure's file, and on origin a58f8e68c SCRIP names every procedure after the driver when the
#       library is found through IPATH (the IPL and Arizona runners -- hq_icon's open iftrace defect) and after the LAST file when the
#       library is handed over on the command line (the Jcon runner's two-file build). So the IPATH witness traces a procedure the
#       driver defines, and the two-file witness one the library defines: each prints the right name before hq_icon's cure (a linked
#       procedure names its own file) and after it.
#   R   declared_row_in_table (lib_declared_arena.sh): rc 0 for a declaring row; rc 1 AND a "⛔ UNDECLARED (RULES.md 8 (f))" line naming
#       the unit, for no row and for a row whose every cell is empty; rc 2 for no table
#   U   THE CENSUS on the real corpus: util_icon_package_units.py missing reads 0 for ipl, arizona_tests and jcon_tests, the looked-up
#       population printed beside each
#   F   FAIL-ONCE for the census: a scratch Jcon-shaped package whose driver-graded library has no row reads rc 1 naming the library
#   J, A, I   the Jcon, Arizona and IPL runners, each on a scratch package outside corpus and a scratch progress table: the witness
#       library `lib`, graded through lib_driver, with its row keyed by the LIBRARY and declaring --stlimit, reads PASS in both modes
#       (under the driver's key -- Jcon until this landing -- it reads FAIL: no row, no switch, no trace); and `bare`, a program with no
#       row, is named on the runner's "-- undeclared ... : 1 --" line and nothing else is
#
# FAIL-ONCE, MEASURED 2026-09-27 (coo), in a detached worktree of origin a58f8e68c (its lib_declared_arena.sh and three runners, this
# gate and util_icon_package_units.py copied in, the real corpus beside it): 4 of 7 red -- R (declared_row_in_table: command not
# found), and J, A and I print no undeclared line, J reading lib FAIL/FAIL besides (its driver's key found no row, so no switch);
# W and F green by construction. And U over corpus 8a8dcd74c's three tables (a scratch copy): RED, 631, 23 and 3 missing. On this
# landing: 7 of 7.
