# test_gate_sno_code_compiled_call_to_a_function_defined_at_run_time_takes_the_open_road.sh -- code compiled at run time by CODE() that calls a function DEFINEd at run time (a computed prototype, or a second DEFINE of the name) calls it.
#
# # ⛔ THE DEFECT (the cfo's reading to hq_snobol4, 2026-10-07 10:4x CDT, SCRIP f5512845c): P = 'CAT(A,B)'; DEFINE(P); body CAT = A '-' B :(RETURN); C = CODE('TW TW = CAT(X, X) :(RETURN)'); DEFINE('TW(X)'); OUTPUT = TW(7)
#   sbl prints 7-7; SCRIP, in mode 3 and in mode 4 (the fragment is compiled at run time in both), died with a BOMB in bb_call_proc_staged ("the CALL2BB slice-2 slim road (zref arm) retired ... the SCC probe held but no
#   tiny or signature arm took the call") and dumped core. The run-time DEFINE (rt_sno_runtime_define) marks the procedure `redefined`, which refuses bb_tiny_shim_ok, while bb_scc_probe -- asked at the call site of a fragment compiled
#   AFTER the DEFINE ran -- still held: the one combination the site's arms reach no road for. A main-program call to the same function was compiled before the DEFINE ran, saw no procedure, and took the open road.
#   THE CURE: bb_scc_probe refuses a redefined procedure (rt_proc_is_redefined), so a site that cannot name a stable entry takes the open road a main-program site takes. The class is every redefined procedure called from a fragment.
#
# THE ARMS (expectations cut from sbl -bf AT RUN TIME): each program in m3 and in m4
#   1-2  COMPUTED PROTOTYPE: the cfo's five-statement witness                                                      -- RED on base (BOMB)
#   3-4  COMPUTED PROTOTYPE, MAIN-PROGRAM CALL FIRST, then the fragment's                                          -- RED on base
#   5-6  A SECOND DEFINE of the name with another entry label, then the fragment's call                            -- RED on base
#   7-8  THREE FORMALS AND TWO LOCALS, computed prototype                                                          -- RED on base
#   9-10 CONTROL: a literal DEFINE, the fragment calls it (the road that always worked)
# EXIT: 0 all arms pass · 1 an arm failed · 2 REFUSED (no binary, no oracle, no tmpdir, the oracle's answer moved).
