#
# THE DEFECT THIS PINS: lower_pl_stage2 wrapped every non-declarative directive in ignore(...), concatenated the
# wrapped directives AND every initialization/1 goal into ONE conjunctive root graph, and registered it as "main".
# ignore/1 contains FAILURE, not EXCEPTIONS -- so a directive that THREW escaped the whole conjunction to the root
# omega port (rt_pl_root_omega), which reports the ball and calls exit(0). Every later directive and every
# initialization goal was skipped, and the process exited SUCCESSFULLY with empty output. That is what made 2 of the
# 9 graded swi_tests files read as "the compiler emits nothing at all" -- rc=0, 0 bytes, no cause visible anywhere.
# THE CURE: ignore(catch(D, E, format(user_error, 'Warning: directive raised: ~q~n', [E]))) -- containment extended
# from failure to exceptions, which is SWI's own load behaviour, with the diagnostic KEPT rather than swallowed.
#
# WHAT IT PROVES, in four directions so a silent compiler cannot pass it:
#   (a) THE CURE: a raising directive is contained -- the later directive and initialization/1 still run, both modes.
#   (b) CONTROL, AND THE ONE THAT MATTERS MOST: the diagnostic is still PRINTED and still NAMES THE CULPRIT.
#       Without this arm the cheapest passing "cure" is catch(D,_,true) -- which trades a loud death for a SILENT
#       skip, i.e. the same class of defect facing the other way. Arm (a) alone cannot tell those two apart.
#   (c) CONTROL: a directive that merely FAILS is still contained, as ignore/1 always did -- the cure must not be a
#       regression of the behaviour it extends.
#   (d) CONTROL: containment is scoped to DIRECTIVES. An exception raised by the initialization GOAL itself must
#       still reach the reporter, or "contain everything everywhere" would pass and hide real program errors.
#   (e) The oracle is ASSERTED, never assumed: swipl is run on every arm and the gate REFUSES if its answer moved.
# ⛔ Hermetic: every program is written under mktemp; nothing in corpus/ is read or written.
