# util_queue_visibility_census.py (ceo, 2026-08-28 — born from Lon's trust audit: "if items got lost the
# instant they were minted, you must go back and scan for missed items").  THE PICKER'S RULE IS THE
# INSTRUMENT: any claim file hides a row, DONE or not (s4e_msg.sh next).  Every prior by-eye health check
# that read QUEUE.tsv's state column over-counted pickable work and missed hidden rows — this script asks
# the authoritative question instead, and it found (first run): the beauty blocker hidden behind a false
# bare-DONE whose DONE-WHEN named a script that never existed; 7 rowless batons incl. an announce-tier
# item; 3 claims held by stood-down seats.  Classes:
#   A2  FREE row hidden behind a DONE-marked claim (the suites-row class — verify the DONE, then release)
#   B   live claim held by a stood-down seat (liveness law: corroborate, then beta)
#   C!  task file with NO row in QUEUE.tsv AND none in QUEUE.done.tsv (unreachable work)
#   E   task file with no ^DONE-WHEN: line (unclosable by construction)
#   F   PARKED/BLOCKED row with no owner (nobody re-runs its gate)
#   P   task file whose ^DONE-WHEN: line is still the MINT PLACEHOLDER (unclosable the same way E is, but
#       harder to see: the line EXISTS, so E cannot catch it, and `done` executes it whole -- prose is not a
#       command, so a seat can do the whole job correctly and still get a refusal INDISTINGUISHABLE from the
#       one a genuinely wrong cure produces (hq_P census 2026-09-05, ceo ruling CEO-289).
# ⛔⭐ CLASS P KEYS ON THE DONE-WHEN LINE, NEVER ON THE FILE, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT OF THE ARM.  The
# obvious census -- grep -l the placeholder text over tasks/ -- returns 112 where the true figure is 44, a
# 2.5x OVER-REPORT, because ledger lines, handoff notes and QA answers MENTION the placeholder; hq_P found
# two such lines they had written themselves an hour earlier recording that they had REMOVED one.  The
# instrument counted the cure as the disease.  ⭐ It fails in the INFLATING direction, which is the more
# persuasive one: a scary number invites action rather than scrutiny.  Same family as `command -v` for an
# oracle -- a well-formed answer to a slightly different question.
# Exit 0 with all classes empty; exit 1 with findings; exit 2 if the postoffice is unreadable (REFUSE,
# never a silent green — a census that cannot read its subject has measured nothing).

# board sat FREE for 23 hours while every seat's make test read them as tolerated reds, and 227 rank-0/1 rows sat FREE in HQ lanes -- 40
# at rank 0 -- that their HQs would not serve while each held its one row. The ceo swept both by hand; these two lines make the sweep a
# reading, printed EVERY run, zero included.
#   BLOCKING-RED PAST WINDOW  a row whose baton LINKS line carries BLOCKING-RED and whose owner has not STARTED within two hours of the later
#       of the tagged time (`since <ISO>`) and the row's first assignment. STARTED is the owner's own act: its claim from FREE (CLAIMED:<owner>,
#       or a claim file it holds with no ASSIGNED-BY line), a RUNNING mark on the claim it was assigned (`next` writes one as it serves the row
#       ASSIGNED->RUNNING, and `claim` by name since the same landing), or a LEDGER line of its own dated inside or after the window (an
#       undated one counts: the owner acted). An assignment alone never counts. A row whose times cannot be read is named, never counted.
#   HQ-LANE UNSERVED PAST 24H  a FREE rank-0 or rank-1 row in an HQ lane (owner hq_*), minted more than 24 hours ago, while that HQ holds
#       another live claim -- rank 0 first, oldest first.
# Each named row carries its age and the officer RULES.md's escalation channel (clause 2) routes it to by default: the collector, rt.c and
