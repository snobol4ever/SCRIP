# test_gate_board_population_floor.sh -- THE ACCEPTANCE GATE for row every-board-wrapper-refuses-on-a-
# zero-population-instead-of-passing-vacuously (hq_T -> seat16, 2026-09-04).
#
# THE DEFECT (WITNESSED TWICE IN ONE HOUR, INDEPENDENTLY, IN ONE FILE): test_snobol4_gimpel_suite.sh
# ended with `[ "$M3F" = 0 ] && [ "$M4F" = 0 ]`, vacuously TRUE over an empty results.tsv --
# scorecard_snobol4.sh TRUNCATES results.tsv before doing anything, so an UPSTREAM refusal (the
# concurrent-board registry declining, correctly) leaves it empty, and the wrapper turned that refusal
# into a green board. THE SHAPE: a guard that refuses upstream is undone by a verdict computed
# downstream over the empty result the refusal produced, silent because "no failures" and "nothing
# graded" are the same arithmetic.
#
# ⛔ CORRECTING THE BRIEF'S OWN CITATION: the dispatching message named
# test_snobol4_spitbol_testpgms_suite.sh as a worked "already does the floor" example. It does not
# exist anywhere in this tree (`grep -rl testpgms scripts/` is empty) -- stale by the time it reached
# this seat, exactly the decay this repo's own docs keep warning about. The REAL, verified-on-disk
# precedents this gate's design and ARM 9/10 below are copied from: lib_ladder.sh (already carries
# `[ "$n" -gt 0 ] || refuse "graded ZERO witnesses..."` plus a second, stronger check for a rung
# DECLARED-but-unbuilt), board_beauty_m1.sh and board_icon_master.sh (already call gate_floor()/
# gate_verdict() directly), and util_require_fresh.sh (the shim shape this row's own
# util_require_population.sh is a mechanical copy of, down to the flag parsing).
#
# THE FIX: gate_floor() already existed in lib_gate.sh (used by gate-file-convention scripts). This row
# adds util_require_population.sh -- the CLI shim over it, so a `test_*_suite.sh`/board/scorecard
# wrapper or a Python harness can call the ONE authority without adopting the full GATE_NAME/gate_stamp
# sourcing convention, exactly as util_require_fresh.sh already does for staleness -- and wires it into
# every wrapper this row found with the defect shape.
#
# ⭐⭐ THE CENSUS IS HONEST, NOT UNIFORM (found while doing this row, not assumed): `board_*.sh` and
# `scorecard_*.sh` are NOT one shape. Every one of the 13 board_*.sh + 2 scorecard_*.sh files surveyed
# is EITHER already adequate (board_icon_master.sh / board_beauty_m1.sh call gate_floor directly;
# scorecard_icon.sh's header explains IN WORDS why it has "no pass/fail bar to violate" and uses
# lib_gate.sh's 0/2 convention on purpose) OR legitimately has no boolean verdict at all by design
# (perf-ratio boards, snap/diff comparison tools, board_packages.sh explicitly REPORTED-only "at this
# stage (D1)... D5 turns this into a floor" per its own GOAL). None were wired here because none NEED
# it. See ARM 6 below for the file-by-file account, not a blind grep.
#
# ⛔ A SEPARATE, MORE SEVERE, DIFFERENTLY-SHAPED DEFECT SURFACED DURING THIS CENSUS AND IS DELIBERATELY
# NOT FIXED HERE: six test_*_suite.sh files (test_csnobol4_budne_suite.sh, test_snobol4_pat_rung_suite.sh
# -- which banners itself "MODE-4 HARD GATE" --, test_icon_arizona_suite.sh, test_icon_jcon_suite.sh,
# test_pascal_pat_suite.sh, test_prolog_inria_suite.sh) compute real PASS/FAIL counts and then have NO
# exit-code verdict AT ALL (an unconditional `exit 0`, or simply no `exit` after the last printf, so the
# script's own rc is whatever that printf returns). THIS ROW'S CURE IS "ADD A FLOOR BEFORE AN EXISTING
# COMPARISON" -- these six have no comparison to put a floor before, and inventing pass/fail thresholds
# for six suites this seat does not own the semantics of is a judgment call for whoever owns each one,
# not a mechanical fix. ARM 6 lists them as a NAMED, TRACKED GAP (not a gate failure of THIS row, not a
# silent pass either) and this session sends an `ask` to hq_T so it is not lost.
#
# ARMS: 1-3 the shim itself (control, refusal, bad usage) · 4-5 REAL dynamic fail-once proofs (the
# Python harness on a genuinely empty suite pair; the gimpel wrapper under FORCED board contention --
# the exact witnessed scenario) · 6 the CENSUS, printed denominator, three-way classified · 7 lib_ladder.sh
# still carries its own (stronger) floor · 8 the one-copy invariant (util_require_population.sh has no
# floor logic of its own; gate_floor defined exactly once).
# EXIT: 0 all arms · 1 an arm failed · 2 REFUSED (could not measure -- unbuilt tree).
