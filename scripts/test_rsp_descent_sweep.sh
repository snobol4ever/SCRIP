# s58 RSP-ONLY DESCENT SWEEP (Lon in-chat: "run the entire test suite in RSP only mode... determine what state it ends").
# The coming-out side is frozen: RETURN/FRETURN/NRETURN are BOMBS.  Classification per program (m4 TEXT, the TINY-REAL scheme):
#   PASS              ran to completion, output == oracle (programs that never call a DEFINE)
#   DESCENT_OK        died at BOMB-RETURN with stdout a PREFIX of the oracle's output — the call made it all the way down
#   BOMB_RETURN_BAD   BOMB-RETURN but pre-bomb stdout is NOT an oracle prefix — descent reached RETURN with corrupted state
#   BOMB_FRETURN/BOMB_NRETURN   died at those floaters (prefix not checked — FRETURN paths diverge from oracle by design here)
#   COMPILE_FAIL / ASM_FAIL / TIMEOUT / SIG<n> / DIFF   everything else — the bugs to fix before only depth-spots remain
#   ORACLE_FAIL       s60: sbl itself produced nothing and scrip agreed — no oracle to grade against (NOT a scrip defect)
# s60: parameterized (SWEEP_DIRS / SWEEP_LIST) + parallel (SWEEP_JOBS) so the corpus checkout can be swept, not just SCRIP test+demo.
#      Classification logic is ONE AUTHORITY (classify_one) shared by every caller.  Default invocation is byte-identical in
#      behaviour to the s58/s59 instrument: SWEEP_DIRS="test demo", SWEEP_JOBS=1.

# the benchmark corpus prints an ELAPSED TIME line by construction (20 of 23 programs), so a byte-compare against the oracle reads DIFF for a
# CORRECT engine and DIFF for a BROKEN one -- the arms COINCIDE, which is the STANDING INSTRUMENT RULE's own definition of an instrument that is
# DARK for the class under test.  Elapsed milliseconds are not a semantic property of the program; the deterministic checksum line beside it is,
# and those stay byte-compared.  The pattern is anchored (^ms: [0-9]+$) so no result line, no numeric output, and no ms-bearing DATA can be caught.
