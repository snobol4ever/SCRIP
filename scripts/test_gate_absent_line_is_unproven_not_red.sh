# test_gate_absent_line_is_unproven_not_red.sh -- DONE-WHEN for row
# a-refusal-reported-in-the-vocabulary-of-a-red-absent-line-read-as-unparseable (seat15, dispatched by
# hq_T, 2026-09-05).
#
# THE DEFECT: hq_C measured test_corpus_snobol4.sh KILLING 4 programs at its 120s per-program bound under
# fleet load 3.6 -- a COULD-NOT-MEASURE that script itself already reports honestly (rc=2, "⛔ GATE
# REFUSES: ... NOT graded, NOT failures"). A CONSUMER of that board greeted the resulting ABSENT summary
# line with "FAIL m3=UNPARSEABLE" -- a sentence about the COMPILER that was really a sentence about the
# MACHINE. SAME ANIMAL AS EVERY OTHER INSTRUMENT DEFECT THIS SESSION: an instrument that answers a
# narrower question than the reader thinks they asked, and never says so. THE WORK: census every consumer
# that infers a verdict from an ABSENT expected line and make each distinguish three outcomes -- present
# and green, present and red, or ABSENT (UNPROVEN, rc=2, reported with what was actually seen) -- never
# folding the third into the first or second. The board itself (test_corpus_snobol4.sh) is NOT the
# defect and is this gate's control: it already buckets a kill as NOT GRADED, NOT A FAILURE.
#
# TWO PARTS:
#   PART A (behavioural) -- exercises lib_gate.sh's gate_three_way, the shared primitive every fixed
#     consumer below now calls, against synthetic present-green / present-red / sub-refused / timed-out /
#     signalled / format-changed inputs. No compiler build required: fast, deterministic, and it is what
#     actually PROVES the primitive's contract rather than trusting its own comment.
#   PART B (structural census) -- re-discovers, FRESH every run (never a hardcoded snapshot), every
#     script under scripts/ that actually RUNS test_corpus_snobol4.sh and captures its output, and reds
#     if any such consumer still carries a known-bad absence idiom -- so a consumer added LATER without
#     the three-way split reds HERE, on this gate, rather than on someone's next false board. It also
#     asserts each of the six call-sites landed by this row still carries its cure (a reverted fix is a
#     regression this census must catch, not silently miss).
#
# NOT censused by the automated sweep, audited by hand instead (both confirmed clean, 2026-09-05):
# util_build_score_md.py (already does exactly this -- "a pattern miss is UNPROVEN, never a guess", with
# its own SELFTEST) and util_score_row.py (never invokes a test script at all -- see its own line 20:
# "if you find yourself adding a subprocess call to a test script here, you are writing the other tool").
# Python consumers would spell the same defect differently (`.get(..., 0)`, `or 0`, ...); the mechanical,
# greppable sweep below is bash-specific by construction. Broadening it is follow-on work, not this row's
# DONE-WHEN, which scopes to "start with the arms that consume test_corpus_snobol4.sh" (the GOAL's own
# words) -- see the row's LEDGER for the exact six call-sites landed and what remains open.
#
# Exit: 0 all green · 1 measured and something failed · 2 refused to grade (prerequisite missing).
