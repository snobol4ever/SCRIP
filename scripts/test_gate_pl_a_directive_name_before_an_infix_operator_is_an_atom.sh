# test_gate_pl_a_directive_name_before_an_infix_operator_is_an_atom.sh -- the twelve directive names the Prolog parser reads as
# prefix declarations (dynamic discontiguous multifile module_transparent meta_predicate use_module ensure_loaded table
# thread_local public record mode) are ATOMS when an infix operator follows them, and declarations everywhere else, both modes
# (row prolog-a-directive-name-before-an-infix-operator-is-an-atom-so-use-module-slash-1-parses, minted by the ceo 2026-10-02 from
# the Logtalk 3.103.0-b01 run: nine lines of Logtalk's core.pl died on X = f(use_module/1) with "expected ) to close argument list").
#
# THE CURE (src/parsers/prolog/prolog_parse.c, the TK_ATOM case's directive-name block): the block's own token-kind list is replaced
# by prefix_arg_starts(), the rule every other prefix operator obeys, which reads an infix-only operator after the name as "no
# argument starts here".
# WITNESS A, cut 2026-10-03 from gplc 1.4.5: every name before / in a list, use_module/1 inside f(...), ensure_loaded/1 as an
#   argument, dynamic as the left operand of =, the bare names in a list, and the functional declaration forms in use.
# WITNESS B, cut 2026-10-03 from swipl 9.0.4 (gplc holds none of the names as operators and refuses these forms): the PREFIX
#   declaration forms -- :- dynamic foo/1.  :- dynamic bar/1, baz/2.  :- multifile m1/1. -- still declare (assertz, retract and
#   a call of the multifile predicate with no clauses fail as declared predicates do). These are the over-cure controls: a cure that
#   stopped reading the names as prefix operators passes witness A and fails here.
# NOT GRADED: calling a discontiguous(d1/1) predicate with no clauses -- the oracles disagree (gplc raises existence_error, swipl
# fails, SCRIP fails as swipl does), so no witness here grades it.
# FAIL-ONCE: on the parent the whole of witness A is a parse error (main never runs).
