# test_gate_pas_uses_and_units_answer_as_fpc.sh -- a program's uses clause names units SCRIP compiles WITH it, whole-program, and
# every arm answers byte-identical to fpc (Lon 2026-10-10 to the ceo, CEO-1611: "Certainly we should allow the "uses" feature for
# Pascal since SNOBOL4 has INCLUDE, and Snocone will have import."; row pascal-uses-and-units-compile-time-whole-program-...).
#
# THE DESIGN (the ceo's, CEO-1611): uses is COMPILE-TIME. The grammar takes a unit (interface, implementation, initialization or a
# begin part, finalization) and a uses clause in a program, a unit's interface and its implementation; uses, unit, interface,
# implementation, initialization and finalization are CONTEXTUAL keywords, so an ISO program keeps them as identifiers (arm kw).
# The driver (pascal_driver.c) resolves each named unit once, transitively, as a file beside the program matched case-insensitively
# (.pas or .pp) or SCRIP's own prelude unit (src/parsers/pascal/prelude/: sysutils, math, strings, strutils), refuses crt as
# NEEDS_INTERACTIVE_TTY, and hangs the units on the program as a trailing units part in dependency order. The lowerer's
# pas_flatten_units merges them into the program before E_program: a unit's implementation-only names and a public name two scopes
# declare become U.name in the unit's scope; a bare name in a scope resolves to its own declaration, else to the LAST unit of that
# scope's uses clauses exporting it (fpc's rule, arm clash's two orders); U.name qualified resolves directly; interface headings
# become forward declarations; initialization parts run in dependency order before the body. FINALIZATION, A MEASURED FACT OF THE
# ORACLE fpc 3.2.2 AND NOT A PASCAL RULE (ceo CEO-1617: a later oracle swap re-measures it, ARCH-PASCAL-DIALECTS.md section 2): fpc runs a unit's
# finalization part AFTER it has closed the standard files, so its writes never appear (measured: a finalization that writes a file
# and then writeln -- the file is written, the line is not); SCRIP runs the finalization parts in reverse order after the body behind
# __pas_std_mute, which flushes stdout and points fd 1 at /dev/null.
#
# ARMS, every expectation CUT LIVE from fpc (fpc's default mode for the unit arms, -Miso for arm kw), byte-identical in BOTH modes:
#   units  -- ubase/utop/p: a private helper in two units, a qualified call ubase.twice(1), initialization order, a finalization
#             whose output fpc never shows, the prelude's IntToStr, UpperCase, Trim, Max and Power.
#   shapes -- Shapes/q: a unit's enum, record, const and var; a begin initialization; an implementation-only var; the program's own
#             Value shadowing the unit's; the qualified statement shapes.bump; the qualified enum constant Shapes.Green.
#   clash  -- ua/ub with f in both: uses ua, ub and uses ub, ua answer differently, as fpc does.
#   kw     -- unit, interface, implementation, initialization, finalization and uses as variables of an ISO program.
#   mode   -- {$mode objfpc} sets the dialect switch before the parse (ARCH-PASCAL-DIALECTS.md § 2, CEO-1614): the six words are
#             reserved, uses needs no flip, and integers print bare as in every non-ISO dialect.
# THE SWITCH: one dialect per program, the parser state's dialect field (ISO by default, ISO, FPC, ObjFPC, Delphi), set by the lexer
# on {$mode} and flipped from the ISO default to FPC by the first uses or unit; the decision reaches the lowerer only through the
# tree, as the lexer's seen_mode event on the next leaf -- which pas_flatten_units applies from the uses part it drops.
# REFUSALS (SCRIP's own diagnostics, rc non-zero): a missing unit, uses crt, and a unit compiled as a program.
# FAIL_ONCE=1 corrupts one ref to prove the gate can fail.
