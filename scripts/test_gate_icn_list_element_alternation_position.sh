# test_gate_icn_list_element_alternation_position.sh -- an ALTERNATION in a NON-FIRST element of an Icon list
# constructor must evaluate to its FIRST alternative, exactly as it does in the first element position.
#
# THE CLASS (hq_I 2026-09-05, cured in src/lower/lower_icon.c, row icon-arizona-io-list-element-assign-
# alternation-swallows-open): lower_make_list chained sibling elements with the file-local helper gamma_to,
# which redirects an edge to the target's BETA port whenever icn_gen_wiring(target) is true. A forward sibling
# edge must always enter at ALPHA -- beta is the RESUME port, so the box was being resumed before it had ever
# run and handed back its SECOND alternative. Visible in the emitted asm as the preceding element ending
# "jmp nN_disjunction_beta". The sibling loop in lower_call already chained its arguments with lc_gamma_to,
# which is why call arguments were always correct and only list elements were wrong.
#
# ⛔ WHY THE POSITION IS THE WHOLE POINT, AND WHY THIS GATE IS POSITIONAL RATHER THAN A SINGLE WITNESS
# (hq_B's landing condition): [7|9, 1] was CORRECT while [1, 7|9] and [1, 2, 7|9] were WRONG -- element 1 has
# no predecessor, so there is no forward edge to mis-wire and the box is entered at alpha by falling into it.
# Any future refactor of that chaining reintroduces the defect INVISIBLY unless the first-position control and
# the later-position witnesses are graded together, which is what this gate exists to do.
#
# ⛔ ONLY IR_DISJUNCTION EVER TRIPPED IT, and the non-alternation control pins that: gamma_to tested the ENTRY
# node lower() returned, and for "to" and "!" that entry is a plain operand node (alpha). IR_DISJUNCTION is the
# one construct that is simultaneously its own entry AND a generator kind.
#
# ⛔ list_alt_resume IS A WITNESS, NOT A CONTROL, and it was filed as one for exactly one sitting before the
# fail-once run corrected it: it reads RED pre-cure (74 alone, where the oracle wants the full 2x2 cross
# product 73 74 83 84), so it discriminates nothing about the cure DIRECTION and a control that is red before
# the cure is just a witness with a misleading name. It is kept because it also guards the OVER-CORRECTION --
# a cure that alpha-wired every generator entry rather than only the forward sibling edge would break the
# resume chain and this is the arm that would catch it -- but that second role does not make it a control.
#
# ⛔ THE DEFECT WAS A SILENT WRONG ANSWER AT rc=0, NEVER A CRASH, so no exit-code or crash-count gate anywhere
# could see it: arizona general/io.icn printed "no /dev/null" and died at source line 9 of 218 because the
# wrong branch ran stop() -- while /dev/null had opened perfectly well. Grade by VALUE against the oracle here,
# never by rc; an rc check on any of these six programs reads clean in both directions.
#
# rc=0 CLEAN (every witness and control matches the icont-cut ref in both modes), rc=1 VIOLATION (at least one
# does not), rc=2 UNPROVEN (no oracle, no fresh binary, a missing fixture, or a zero denominator).
