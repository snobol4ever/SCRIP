# test_gate_pre_commit_refuses_a_conflict_marker.sh — the invariant gate for ARM 1 of the pre-commit hook
# (row `pre-commit-hook-refuses-a-staged-conflict-marker-in-any-tracked-file`, hq_C's mint, ceo CEO-370 rank 1).
#
# WHAT IT PROTECTS. A conflict marker committed to a shared authority does not fail where it was made -- it
# fails for every other seat, in a file they never touched. Measured 2026-09-06: a SCORE.md landed carrying
# markers, util_score_row.py could not parse the table, and THE LEADERBOARD WRITER WAS DEAD FOR AN HOUR WHILE
# EVERY BOARD STILL READ GREEN -- because a failed row-write is non-fatal BY DESIGN (gate_score_row), so that a
# bookkeeping failure never reds a board. Both decisions are right on their own and compose into a hole.
#
# ⛔ THE EXEMPTION ARM IS AS LOAD-BEARING AS THE REFUSAL ARM. Three tracked archives legitimately contain a
# marker as CONTENT (they archive a historical conflict). A guard that refuses those is a guard that gets
# bypassed with --no-verify, and a hook bypassed once is bypassed by habit. Both directions are graded here.
#
# ⛔ IT GRADES THE HOOK IN A SCRATCH REPO, never this one. A gate that stages files in the tree it is checking
# would leave a dirty index behind on a failure -- and it is precisely the failure path that must be safe.
#

# corpus/tests/snobol4/ALL.ref carries one NUL byte (a legitimate CHAR(0) witness), so a marker there must
# still be found. ⛔⭐ THIS ARM ASSERTS THE PROPERTY, AND IT DOES NOT PROVE THE `-a` FLAG -- I checked, and
# saying so is the point. Measured 2026-09-06: this box's INTERACTIVE shell defines `grep` as a FUNCTION
# routing to ugrep 7.8.4, while scripts and hooks resolve /usr/bin/grep, GNU grep 3.11. On a NUL-bearing
# file they DISAGREE: ugrep answers rc=1 without -a and rc=0 with it; GNU grep answers rc=0 either way.
# So ablating -a from the hook leaves this arm green -- not because the arm is weak, but because the hook
# runs under the grep that does not need it. `-a` stays in the hook as the portable form; this arm grades
# the behaviour we actually require, which is the honest thing an arm can claim.
# ⭐ THE GENERAL RESULT IS WORTH MORE THAN THE ARM: a claim measured in the interactive shell and relied on
# in a script is a claim measured with a DIFFERENT TOOL, silently. That is the real cause behind the
# fleet's "grep is blind to ALL.ref" lesson, which has been carried for weeks without a cause attached.
