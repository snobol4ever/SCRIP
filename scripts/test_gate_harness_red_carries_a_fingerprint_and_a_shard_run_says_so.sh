# test_gate_harness_red_carries_a_fingerprint_and_a_shard_run_says_so.sh -- A RED IS A BUCKET, NOT A VERDICT (hq_snobol4 2026-09-16 to the
# coo; rows instruments-a-red-is-a-bucket-every-board-prints-a-fingerprint-beside-each-red-and-the-denominator-of-its-comparison and

#
# THE DEFECT, MEASURED: SnoM read 1962/1981 with a defect and 1962/1981 without it, all seven SNOBOL4 package boards at their totals,
# red NAME SETS identical -- while spitbol_testpgms test1 was red on base AND head with a DIFFERENT first diff each time (ERROR AT 137
# ERRTYPE 22 became ERROR AT 72 ERRTYPE 29).  Counts and name sets treat reds as interchangeable, so a program that got MORE wrong
# while staying red was invisible.  And a --shard k/N harness run appended progress rows a reader could not tell from a full board's.
#
# ARMS (a three-entry fixture cut from the SNOBOL4 master into mktemp, entry 2's ref broken so it reads FAIL both runs; a scratch DB):
#   (a) run A: the RED line for entry 2 carries [fp=<md5/8 of our stdout> rc=<n>] and the DB row's note carries the same fp= token
#   (b) run B: entry 2's SOURCE replaced by entry 3's (same name, same broken ref): the count is unchanged (1 red, same name) and the
#       fingerprint MOVED -- the shape change the counts and name sets could not see
#   (c) a --shard 1/2 run stamps shard=1/2 into every progress row it appends; the full runs stamped none
# FAIL_ONCE=1 copies run A's fingerprint over run B's before arm (b) asserts, to prove the arm trips.
