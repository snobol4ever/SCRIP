# test_gate_icn_writes_to_errout_flushes_output_first.sh -- WRITING TO &errout FLUSHES &output FIRST, IN BOTH MODES, AS ICONX DOES
# (hq_icon 2026-09-26, crawl work under CEO-1270: IPL openchk and press, the AD class).
#
# iconx flushes &output before anything reaches &errout, so a program's merged stdout+stderr reads in program order. The
# write builtin flushed stdout before a file argument only for write (the nl case), never for writes; a mode-4 binary, whose
# stdout is fully buffered into a file, therefore printed writes(&errout, ...) ahead of every earlier stdout line
# (openchk: "Open of ..." ahead of "close again", then " failed." after it). The master discards stderr, so this is graded
# here: the witness runs under icont/iconx, m3 and m4 with stdout and stderr merged into one file, and all three must agree.
# On by_name_dispatch.c before the cure the m4 file differs (red).
