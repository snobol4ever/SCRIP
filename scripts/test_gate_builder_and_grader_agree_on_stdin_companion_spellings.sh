#
# ⛔⭐⭐ THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES, MEASURED BEFORE IT WAS TOUCHED (hq_V 2026-09-11). One question -- "does this
# program have stdin?" -- was written down THREE times with THREE different answers:
#     corpus_suite_harness.loose_stdin_companion()          .stdin  .in  .input   (beside + config/)
#     util_build_master_suite.py generalised stdin guard             .in  .input   (beside + config/)
#     util_build_master_suite.py snobol4 plain-program guard         .input        (beside + config/)
# and ALL 8 icon stdin companions in this corpus are spelled `config/<stem>.stdin` -- the one spelling the
# BUILDER did not know. A program whose input the builder cannot see is not refused: it is ABSORBED as an
# ordinary pair, the master then grades a stdin-reading program against /dev/null, it exits at EOF before
# reaching the behaviour it was written to test, and the auto-xfail path files the starved run as a
# DOCUMENTED red. THERE IS NO XFAIL -- every one of those is a FAIL on the board.
# ⭐ PROVED BOTH DIRECTIONS ON SCRATCH CORPORA ONE BYTE APART, which is what this gate mechanises: the same
# program with `config/w.stdin` was ABSORBED (0 excluded, entry stamped XFAIL) and with `config/w.in` was
# EXCLUDED BY NAME. Same source, same input bytes, same ref; the spelling alone decided.
# ⚠ THE GAP WAS ARMED, NOT LATENT. The 8 icon programs are held out today only by a KEEP.md declaration --
# which is checked BEFORE this guard -- so the builder's masters do not move. rung36_jcon_recogn fell through
# the instant its deferral row reached DONE, and the other seven are one retired declaration away each.
#
# ⛔ THE GATE READS THE SPELLINGS FROM THE HARNESS, NEVER FROM A LIST OF ITS OWN. A hand-maintained copy of
# the list is the defect this gate exists to prevent, so adding a spelling to STDIN_COMPANION_SUFFIXES must
# automatically widen the gate. A gate that carried its own fourth copy would drift exactly as the other
# three did, and would read GREEN while doing it.
# ⛔ IT GRADES ON ITS OWN FIXTURES, NEVER ON THE CORPUS MASTER (CEO-547 part 2): a synthetic corpus per
# spelling, built and torn down here, so the gate is runnable by any seat under ONE RUNNER, ONE BOARD.
#
# EXIT: 0 every spelling in both locations is CARRIED into ALL.in by the builder and found by the grader
#       · 1 a spelling the grader knows is INVISIBLE to the builder (the absorb-unfed defect is back)
#       · 2 REFUSED -- cannot measure (no python3, harness will not import, no spellings, builder not found).

    # ⛔⭐ THE ASSERTION MOVED FROM "THE BUILDER REFUSES IT" TO "THE BUILDER CARRIES IT", 2026-09-11 (hq_V),
    # AND THAT IS A STRENGTHENING, NOT A WEAKENING -- read this before changing it back. The defect this gate
    # was written for is UNCHANGED and is still what it measures: the builder and the grader must answer the
    # same question about a file, or a stdin-reading program is graded against /dev/null. What changed is the
    # ANSWER agreement produces. It used to be "both refuse", because the master had no way to carry input;
    # the master pair ships ALL.in and the icon master was already grading 20 stdin-fed entries while that
    # park went on turning the rest away, so agreement now means THE BUILDER CARRIES WHAT THE GRADER WOULD FEED.
    # ⛔ THE OLD FAILURE IS STILL CAUGHT, and by a STRICTER test: a builder that cannot see this spelling does
    # not refuse the pair -- it absorbs it UNFED, and then ALL.in has no block for the probe and the byte
    # comparison below fails. A builder that sees it but drops the text fails the same arm. The previous form
    # could be satisfied by a refusal for ANY reason; this one can only be satisfied by the input arriving.

# corpus_suite_harness.STDIN_COMPANION_SUFFIXES -- which is right, and is the whole point of asking the one
# authority -- but it means DELETING A SPELLING DELETES ITS FIXTURES TOO: the mutation that removed `.stdin`
# and `.input` took the run from 12 checks to 4 and the gate still printed a green tick. The count was on
# screen and nothing refused, which is this project's own "a criterion that is never evaluated looks exactly
# like one that was satisfied". ⛔ 12 IS NOT A TASTE: 3 spellings (.stdin/.in/.input) x 2 locations (beside,
# config/) x 2 languages (icon, snobol4) is the population this gate was written over, and a smaller one is a
# CAPABILITY THAT WENT AWAY, which must be a loud rc=2 refusal and never a quiet pass. Raise the floor in the
# same landing that adds a spelling; a floor that is never raised is a ratchet nobody turns.
