# test_gate_icn_generator_return_ends_the_activation_and_varargs_image_as_the_list.sh -- two things a traced
# procedure that CONTAINS a suspend still got wrong after 1493214e4 raised its RETURN event: the return did
# not END the activation (the next resume reached omega and printed a spurious "NAME failed", where Icon's
# return removes the generator), and its variadic parameter imaged as &null instead of the collected list.
# Both had ONE cause and are cured together (row icon-a-traced-generator-that-returns-traces-as-failed, cfo,
# under CEO-545). 1493214e4 named the first of them explicitly as left uncured; the second it never touched.
#
# ⛔ IT SITS BESIDE test_gate_icn_generator_return_traces_returned_not_failed.sh, NOT INSTEAD OF IT, and the
# overlap was checked rather than assumed: that gate bounds its generator with `\ 2` so the post-return
# resume NEVER HAPPENS -- which is exactly why it could go green while the spurious "failed" stood. This one
# drives the generator to exhaustion with no bound, which is the only shape that reaches the defect.
#
# ⛔ THE CONDITION IS "THE PROCEDURE CONTAINS A suspend", NOT "THE CALL IS VARIADIC" -- that is the finding
# and it is why g3 is here. A variadic NON-generator was already byte-identical to iconx; adding one
# `suspend` to the SAME procedure broke the call image AND the outcome verb at once, because a generator is
# entered through the N-2 region path: its CALL event is raised CALLER-side from the incoming argument
# vector (so the collected tail list is never read and the loop pads with &null), and its `return` is
# lowered as YIELD-THEN-RETIRE (so its only exit tap was omega's, which reports a failure).
#
# ⭐ THE LOAD-BEARING CONTROLS ARE g2 AND g3, and they guard OPPOSITE overshoots. g2's generator never
# returns -- it suspends and is driven to exhaustion -- so it MUST still print "g failed": a cure that
# suppresses the retire tap unconditionally, rather than one fail per recorded return, greens g1 and
# silently deletes the event that test_gate_icn_generator_exhaustion_traces_failed exists to protect. g3 is
# the variadic non-generator that was ALREADY correct, so it catches a cure written too wide in the call path.
#
# ⛔ &trace WRITES ONLY TO stderr; every arm captures 2>&1 for that reason.
# Every .want below is the byte-exact stdout+stderr of icont/iconx 9.5.25a (/home/resources/icon-master/bin).
# EXIT: 0 all six arms byte-identical; 1 a mismatch; 2 REFUSED (no binary, no gcc, stale build).
