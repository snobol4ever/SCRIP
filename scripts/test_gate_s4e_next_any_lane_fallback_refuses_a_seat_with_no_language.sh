# test_gate_s4e_next_any_lane_fallback_refuses_a_seat_with_no_language.sh — THE PICKER'S ANY-LANE FALLBACK REFUSES A
# SEAT THAT OWNS NO LANGUAGE (row picker-dependency-inversion-serves-a-blocker-across-lanes-to-a-seat-that-cures-nothing;
# ceo CEO-771/CEO-779; Lon 2026-09-16 11:22 CDT, verbatim to the ceo: "Get the COO helping. The language seats now run
# their own tests and benchmarks."; CEO-781).
#
# MEASURED 2026-09-16 11:00 CDT on the live postoffice: `next` run by the coo -- whose own-lane pass found nothing --
# fell to the any-lane pass and, by DEPENDENCY INVERSION, CLAIMED the cfo's rank-0 blocker
# icon-gc-rung-2-every-live-aggregate-slides-and-hb-pinned-is-deleted to coo (claims/…claim read "coo / RUNNING");
# CEO-771 measured the same path locking a Raku cure row for the ceo. The picker's own comment said a seat with no lane
# "wanders rather than starves" -- true under EXECUTIVE, a defect under DECTET where the coo, ceo and cto cure nothing
# in a language lane (CEO-723, CEO-766, CEO-775).
#
# THE CURE UNDER TEST (s4e_msg.sh): s4e_seat_owns_a_language; s4e_promotion_admissible refuses a promoted blocker in
# ANOTHER owner's lane to a seat that owns no language in EVERY pass; the ordinary any-lane CROSS-LANE FALLBACK skips
# such rows for such a seat; and when that is all that held the seat back, `next` exits 2 (REFUSED), never "QUEUE EMPTY".
#
# ARMS (hermetic, its own scratch postoffice under mktemp; MODE DECTET; lanes read from the picker's own table):
#   (a) coo: the blocked HQ row's FREE blocker (an HQ's) is NOT claimed, the refusal is printed naming both topics, rc=2
#   (b) ceo (no lane at all): the same blocker is NOT claimed
#   (c) CONTROL — the owning HQ: the blocker IS served (LOCKED, claim written) by dependency inversion
#   (d) CONTROL — a language-owning officer (the rebus owner) with its own FREE row: served its own row, never the blocker
#   (e) coo with an instrument row of its own (owner cell coo): served it, rc=0 -- a lane-less seat is not starved of ITS rows
#   (f) coo, ordinary path: a FREE HQ row with no dependency is NOT served on the fallback, rc=2
# rc 0 = every arm holds; rc 1 = a FAIL named; rc 2 = REFUSED-TO-GRADE (fixture could not be built).
