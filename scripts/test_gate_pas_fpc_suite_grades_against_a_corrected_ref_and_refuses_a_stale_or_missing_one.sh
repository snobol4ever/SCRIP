# test_gate_pas_fpc_suite_grades_against_a_corrected_ref_and_refuses_a_stale_or_missing_one.sh -- the FPC runner's ALL.corrected.tsv block (Lon 2026-10-05: where the
# oracle is wrong and we are right, the program is graded PASSING against the ISO-correct output, never the oracle's defect). Exercises the block alone over mktemp
# fixtures (the runner itself is lane-guarded and writes score rows): a good row is read and printed with its reason; a name not in the suite, a missing
# .ref.corrected, and a .ref.corrected equal to the oracle's .ref (stale: the oracle was fixed) each REFUSE with rc 2; and the shipped test_tisobuf3 row grades
# green in BOTH modes -- SCRIP's stdout equals its corrected ref and its exit code equals ALL.wantrc. FAIL_ONCE=1 corrupts the shipped corrected ref.
