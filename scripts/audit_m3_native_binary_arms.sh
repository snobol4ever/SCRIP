# audit_m3_native_binary_arms.sh — M3-NATIVE-0/1 coverage audit + stub gate.
# Classifies every SM/BB/XA template's x86 MEDIUM_BINARY arm as REAL / TRIVIAL-JMP / NO-ARM / EMPTY,
# and FAILS if any fake two-jmp placeholder ("\xE9"+u32le(0) doubled) survives outside the known-correct
# trivial set (eps/fail/fence — whose full semantics genuinely are two jumps).
# A silent unimplemented x86 BINARY arm let mode-3 fall through to the C oracle and masked missing native
# bytes; M3-NATIVE-0 requires such arms to fail LOUDLY instead.  This script is that gate.
# ⛔ THE REMEDY CHANGED AT THE s269 STRIP: bomb_bytes()/bomb_text() were deleted as dead (no arm called
# either; CEO-11b, Lon indifferent).  The remedy for a fake-jmp stub is now the emission-discipline law
# itself -- IMPLEMENT the arm, adding an encoder to x86_asm.h if an instruction is missing.  Never
# hand-encode bytes.  The BOMB classification is gone with the functions; pass/fail logic is unchanged.
