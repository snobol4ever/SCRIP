# test_gate_sno_stored_pattern_first_guard_matches_spitbol.sh -- A STORED PATTERN'S FIRST-CHARACTER GUARD NEVER CHANGES WHAT THE
# MATCH DOES (ceo 2026-09-29, SCRIP bb51520b1, 5955a2e73 and the cure landed beside this gate; GOAL-SNOCONE-100 cursors 29n-29p).
#
# A PAT$n thunk whose FIRST set the compiler can name fails at its entry, or succeeds with the empty match, when the cursor's
# character cannot start it -- through *X by the pattern the program binds to X, the binding re-checked from X's cell at run time.
# The guard is only a shortcut: the three witnesses below, each cut from /home/resources/x64/bin/sbl -bf into its .ref, must print
# SPITBOL's output in mode 3 and in mode 4. abort_and_bare_fence: a node whose failure edge reaches ABORT (a bare FENCE is lowered
# as its successor's omega -> ABORT) turns a local failure into a whole-match failure, so the guard must stand down -- measured RED at
# 5955a2e73 (cases 1, 2, 3, 5 printed "matched" where SPITBOL fails), GREEN after the cure; twelve_shapes: a nullable immediate
# capture, POS alternatives, NOTANY, a deferred ref before and after the first consumer, a nullable alternation, FENCE, the subject
# end, &ANCHOR, a NUL subject character; bound_and_reassigned: white, White, Gray and $' ' reassigned mid-program (every guard
# stands down) and the empty-success path; alternations: the alternation-level guard (an alternation whose every arm has a known
# first character fails at its entry when none can start) inside ARBNO, under &ANCHOR, after a capture, beside a NUL subject byte.
# Exit 0 = all eight runs match; 1 = a divergence; 2 = cannot measure.
