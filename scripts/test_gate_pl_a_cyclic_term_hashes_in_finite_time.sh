# test_gate_pl_a_cyclic_term_hashes_in_finite_time.sh -- A CYCLIC TERM HASHES IN FINITE TIME, IN BOTH MODES.
# hq_prolog 2026-10-03, the coo's red on swi_tests (CEO-1342 pass 33: core/test_acyclic.pl HANG in mode 4, every case): term_hash/2 (e161ff3b2) walked
# X = f(X) for ever in BOTH modes -- the mode-3 run showed its cases printed before the kill, the mode-4 binary's stdout was block-buffered and showed
# nothing, so the red read as mode 4 only. The walker now marks every compound on its path (pl_acyclic_walk's own mark) and a kid reaching a marked
# ancestor hashes one constant. Witness: X = f(X), term_hash(X, T), integer(T) answers in both modes within 10 s with swipl's text; an acyclic term's
# hash is unchanged by the mark (two equal terms hash equal, a different term differs).
# RED BEFORE on origin b1bee0c53: both modes rc=124 (timeout) on the first witness.
