# test_gate_bootstrap_parse_stage_ir_identity.sh -- A CHANGE TO THE PARSE STAGE LEAVES WHAT THE LOWERER AND THE EMITTER MAKE OF EVERY CORPUS PROGRAM EXACTLY AS IT WAS.
# (Lon 2026-10-08 18:4x CDT, CEO-1566: the parse stage of scrip becomes the linked parser_<lang>.sc object; ceo CEO-1571 named this gate, ARCH-PARSER-SC-BOOTSTRAP.md
# section 3.11 defines it, the cfo's review fixed its cost rule.) The tree-for-tree gate omits :line :lline :file :stno :src, which the C parsers attach and the
# lowerers read, so a tree that MATCHes can still lower differently. THIS gate compares what the parse stage's consumers PRODUCE, per corpus file, between a
# PARENT build and the changed build:
#   (a) `scrip --dump-ir FILE`  stdout + rc   -- the shape of every statement graph. It prints STATEMENT_BEGIN/END with an EMPTY payload, so it is blind to
#                                               the statement number, the line and the source text; it proves the shape and nothing more;
#   (b) `scrip --compile -o X.s FILE` the assembly -- which carries the source text of every statement as a comment (:src), a `.loc` line (:line) and the
#                                               statement-number-to-line table (:stno). The assembly is the half that proves the placement.
# Either half alone is insufficient (measured 2026-10-08: two runs of one build are byte-identical, so the comparison is exact).
# THE PARENT IS NEVER REBUILT PER RUN (cfo: a parent build in a scratch worktree is 7 min 19 s at load 20): its outputs are CAPTURED ONCE, from the build that
# stands before the change is made, into SCRIP/out/ir_identity/<git-short-head>/<lang>/ (out/ is untracked build output), and the changed build is compared to a
# captured directory.
# USAGE
#   bash scripts/test_gate_bootstrap_parse_stage_ir_identity.sh --capture [--lang snobol4] [--population sample|corpus]   record the CURRENT build as a parent
#   bash scripts/test_gate_bootstrap_parse_stage_ir_identity.sh [--against DIR|latest] [--lang snobol4] [--population sample|corpus] [--list-diffs FILE] [--only FILE]   compare the CURRENT build to it
#   --list-diffs FILE writes EVERY differing corpus-relative path (the console shows the first five); --only FILE re-runs just the paths listed in FILE.
#   A file that times out (GATE_TIMEOUT, default 120 s, a loaded machine) is re-run ALONE at GATE_TIMEOUT_ALONE (900 s) before it counts; one that still times out is recorded as rc=124
#   with empty outputs on both sides, which compare equal -- a timeout is a measurement, never a difference.
# EMBEDDED DATES: a program with a listing header prints the compile wall-clock time into its output (x86-64  Thu Oct  8 21:13:33 2026); both halves are normalised to <DATE> before they are stored or compared, or those files differ from themselves.
# CONTROL ARM: run it against a capture taken from a build of the SAME sources (or a behaviour-neutral change, e.g. a whitespace re-flow); it must read green, or
# it proves nothing. rc 0 = every measured file identical; rc 1 = a difference (the first five are printed with their first differing line); rc 2 = could not
# measure (no scrip, no capture, empty population, a capture taken from another population). Serial, under nice 19 (lib_fanout.sh, CEO-1333). Not wired into
# make test or make preflight: it needs a capture, and its full-corpus pass is minutes, not seconds (preflight's arm ceiling is 5 s); the stage-1 row's DONE-WHEN
# calls it by name once it exists.
