# test_gate_monitor_run_runs_its_subject_in_a_scratch_mirror.sh -- monitor_run.sh runs its subject in a scratch mirror of the
# subject's own directory, never in the caller's cwd (coo 2026-09-25, on hq_pascal's measurement: fpc_tests' test_tisobuf2,
# test_tisobuf3 and test_tisoread, monitored from SCRIP/, left testfile, textfile and tisoread.tmp in SCRIP/, the tree read dirty
# and the PAT runner skipped its SCORE row).
# THE WITNESS reads a companion file beside it and writes a new file, both by relative name, and is monitored from a
# scratch "caller" directory. Four arms:
#   (a) --trace: the relative read resolves against the program's directory ("read: hello companion")
#   (b) --modes: a verdict is reached (AGREE, m3 against m4)
#   (c) no file the subject wrote lands in the caller's directory
#   (d) none lands in the program's directory either -- the mirror is scratch, and it dies with the run
# ⭐ FAIL-ONCE IS BUILT IN, EVERY RUN: the same arms grade monitor_run.sh at the parent of the commit that introduced the mirror
# (found with `git log -S` in this tree's history). It must red (a) and (c) and hold (b) and (d) -- the old script read the
# companion from the caller and wrote there.
