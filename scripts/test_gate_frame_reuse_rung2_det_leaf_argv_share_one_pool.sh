# ⭐ RUNG 2 OF frame-slot-reuse-a-live-range-in-a-byrd-graph-extends-to-every-point-reachable-by-recession
# (cto, CEO-684 slice 2): THE DET-LEAF ARGV NON-GRANT.  A call the lowerer SEALED as a det leaf (IR_SEAL_CALL_DET_LEAF,
# rung 2 step 1: the emitter's registry knows the callee, bb_call_fn marshals the argv on alpha and calls a C function
# that returns once, beta falls to omega) has argv that are live ONLY between that call's alpha and its gamma -- the
# marshal is straight copies and NV_GET, no box of this activation runs between the marshal and the call -- so every
# sealed call of a graph marshals into ONE argv block (16 x the widest sealed arity) instead of its own; the block is
# granted once per graph with the claim in its description, and the call's result goes through the ordinary reader
# rule (straight temps' pool, or the shared dead-result scratch when nothing reads it).  The templates take the argv
# base from zls_argv_off (its default is result+16, byte-identical for every unsealed call: Icon and SNOBOL4 emission
# did not move).
# ⛔ THE CLAIM EACH SEALED CALL MAKES, PRINTED BESIDE IT BY --dump-zeta: "det leaf <name>: no beta, argv dead at gamma,
# argv@+N pooled".  A call the registry does not know is never sealed, keeps its own argv and prints "own" or nothing.
# ⛔ THE FAILURE MODE IS SILENCE, so this gate grades ANSWERS as well as bytes: the Prolog witness (ok), the Icon
# silent-failure witness `every write(image(1), 1 to 3)` -- an UNSEALED builtin call whose result is read across the
# generator -- must print 11 12 13 in both modes and its call result must read PINNED (never a pooled candidate),
# and the SNOBOL4 witness (ab) -- in BOTH modes.
# BYTES: r/1 of the DONE-WHEN witness read 480 on the rung-1 tree (the honest dump); the rung's bar is <= 320.
# RED-BEFORE on ffebafe8e (rung 2 step 1): r/1 480, no pooled argv block, rc=1.
# ⛔ REFUSES rc=2 when --dump-zeta yields no r/1 graph -- a runner that cannot measure never prints the success shape.
