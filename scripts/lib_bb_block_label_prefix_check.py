"""lib_bb_block_label_prefix_check.py -- worker for test_gate_bb_block_label_prefix.sh (row
bb-label-prefix-uniform). See that script's header for the ruling this enforces; this file is the
bracket-and-check walk, kept separate so it stays independently testable
(`python3 lib_bb_block_label_prefix_check.py some.s`, prints violations, exit 0/1).

MERGED DESIGN (seat02 2026-08-29, per hq_P's task-LEDGER ruling "SEAT11 COLLISION ADJUDICATED ... THE
RULING: MERGE, DO NOT PICK"): bracketing/ownership-tracking below is seat11's classify() (recovered at
`git show 57ecf03e:scripts/test_gate_bb_block_label_prefix.sh`) -- it treats a bareword Greek-suffixed
landing pad with no "n<uid>_" prefix (PATTERN_BT_α, a DEFINE'd proc's own by-name entry point,
bb_define.cpp) as PRESERVING the enclosing box's identity rather than opening a new block. seat05's
original bracketing here treated any "<word>_<greek>" as a new owner and false-flagged 7 labels on the
pattern_bt.sno witness (measured, hq_P: "NO n<digits>_<kind>_<greek> box port opens between n47_define_*
and n48_statement_end_α -- the whole span is one box's output"). seat11's classifier, unmodified, does
NOT enforce a Greek letter on the _as/_af/_ry/_rt/_s<N> port-target families at all (ceo-endorsed
2026-08-29c: these ARE real box-owned gamma/omega jump targets -- emit.cpp node_γ/node_ω assignment at
~3074/3090/1398/3095 -- not siblings of the exempt _bx range-marker), so that requirement is added below
as its OWN independent check, per hq_P's explicit "add seat05's greek requirement ... as a clearly
separated second check" -- not folded into the bracketing walk, so neither arm's logic has to reason
about the other.

⛔ UTF-8 DISCIPLINE (RULES.md INSTRUMENT LAW #15, this row's own census tool header, seat03 2026-08-29):
match on decoded Greek characters, never their UTF-8 byte sequence via an ASCII-only regex -- that class
of bug already cost this row one full false census once.
