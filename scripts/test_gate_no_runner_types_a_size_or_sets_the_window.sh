# Half (a) of that row's DONE-WHEN, a static census: util_size_setters_census.py names every code line of a script outside test_gate_* that
# sets SCRIP_HEAP_KB/SCRIP_HEAP_MB (the collector's initial WINDOW, never a declared heap) or types a size (a literal -d/-s/-i switch, a
# literal SCRIP size, ulimit -s, an oracle's own size), except a file in THE ONE ALLOWLIST (scripts/fixtures/arena_env_setters_allowlist.txt,
# path<TAB>reason). THE ARMS:
#   1  THE REAL TREE: outside the allowlist 0 and stale rows 0 (red until every runner reads its units' declarations -- the population is
#      printed by file:line, the work list the HQs cure under CEO-801 and the coo reviews);
#   2  the census is selective: a scratch scripts/ with one planted window setter, one typed -s256m, a Python argv "-d512m" and a docstring
#      and a report line that only MENTION sizes names exactly the three setters;
#   3  an allowlisted planted setter is not named, and an allowlist row naming a file that sets nothing reads STALE;
#   4  a malformed allowlist row (no reason) refuses rc 2.
# EXIT 0 all arms hold; 1 an arm failed (arm 1 carries the population); 2 could not measure.
