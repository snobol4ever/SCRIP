"""util_gc_poll_register_liveness.py -- AT EVERY EMITTED SAFE POINT, IS A REGISTER READ AS A POINTER BEFORE IT IS
NEXT WRITTEN?  (ceo, row gc-a-fast-witness-detector-grades-a-safe-point-conversion-batch-in-seconds-proven-against-
the-known-bad-insertion; design .github/ARCH-GC-COMPILE-TIME-FRAME-MAPS.md; law RULES.md FACT RULE THE COLLECTOR
GUESSES NOTHING.)

⛔ WHY THIS EXISTS, NAMED BY THE GATE IT CONTINUES.  test_gate_gc_the_caller_saved_spill_block_never_holds_a_heap_
reference.sh arm (i) measured the standing population and then wrote down its own next step verbatim: "The step
after this one is to ask, per member, whether the reloaded register is read as a pointer before it is next
written."  That gate proved 806 heap references sit in rtccb across collections and that 161 of them name a block
THE COLLECTOR MOVED AND ARE LEFT UNREPAIRED, because nothing visits that block and nothing can (32 untagged words;
visiting them is a conservative scan and CEO-812 froze that out).  A wrong word is only SPENT when the reload's
register is then used as a pointer -- so the unrepaired count is an upper bound and this reader is what turns it
into a defect list or closes the class.

⛔ AND IT IS THE DISCRIMINATOR THE SITE CONVERSIONS NEED, WHICH IS THE MORE EXPENSIVE HALF.  CEO-1107: choosing
polls by the callee's DECLARED RETURN CLASS put 77 in and cost 57 Icon programs, because the return class says what
the callee RETURNS and nothing about what is ALREADY LIVE in a register across the site.  CEO-1110: a 54-witness
6.8-second sweep cleared 14 sites that still cost 7 programs, so THE SWEEP IS NOT SUFFICIENT EITHER.  Both
instruments ask about the program's OUTPUT.  This one asks about the emitted instruction stream, which is where the
defect is, and it is static: no arena, no stress, no load, no master -- so it never competes for the board channel
two seats share (MODE line 2, DUO).

THE READING, and the conservative direction is the whole design.  Everything on the emitted stack is a DESCR and a
register is not on the stack, so a register live across a poll is relocated by NOTHING unless the poll spills it as
a tagged cell (x86_rt_gc_poll_res for rax:rdx, the _rec_sigma family for r13/r15).  The wrong answer here is A LOST
ROOT, so a read is POINTER unless it is PROVABLY too narrow to hold one -- the callee-saved census's own D32 rule
(a 32-bit read zero-extends: a 64-bit pointer cannot survive it), reused rather than reinvented.  Four verdicts per
(safe point, register), and PROPAGATED is its own bucket rather than folded into either answer, because a count
that hides its undecidables is the defect this file exists against:

  POINTER     the register is read as a memory base or index, or handed to a call in a pointer argument slot,
              before any path writes it.  A collection at this safe point spends a stale pointer here.
  SPILLED     the register is stored to memory before any other classified use.  Reported separately because a
              store into a MAPPED FRAME SLOT is the designed cure (ARCH-GC 3), not a defect -- but this reader
              cannot tell a mapped slot from a scratch cell, so it says where the value went and stops.
  NARROW      every read before the next write is provably narrow -- a 32-bit subregister, or a compare or an
              add/sub against an immediate.  Harmless BY MECHANISM rather than by luck.
  PROPAGATED  the register is copied onward past this reader's hop budget, so it cannot place it.  Named, never
              counted clean.
  DEAD        every path writes the register before reading it.  Nothing to protect.

⛔⭐ A POINTER USE IS NOT A DEFECT UNLESS THE POINTEE IS COLLECTABLE, AND THAT COST ME 19 OF MY FIRST 26 FINDINGS.
The first full reading named 19 POINTER findings on r12, all one instruction (`mov qword ptr [r12 + 0], rcx` in
bb_match_capture phase 1), and every one is a FALSE POSITIVE: frame_layout.c calls head.dcap_mark "ZK_RAW -- points
into the base-pinned dcap island, never GC-moved", and pattern_match.c:685 backs that with rt_slab_region() at the
FIXED VA RT_DCAP_TOP = 0x70000000 (pinned by pin_va.h and hardcoded as an absolute disp32 in rtx_match.s).  A fixed-VA
slab reserve is not the collected heap and is NOT the retired hb_pinned/rt_pinned_alloc heap pinning GC-5 rung 2
deletes, so no collection can invalidate r12 there.  DECLARED_NONCOLLECTED is therefore its own bucket with its reason
printed at the exclusion, never a silent subtraction: a register is excluded only where a declaration in the tree says
where it points, and the POINTER total is printed BOTH ways so a reader cannot lose the difference.

⛔⛔ THE ARTIFACT THIS READER WAS BORN WITH, WRITTEN DOWN BECAUSE IT READ AS A CLEAN BILL OF HEALTH.  The rtcc
reload (x86_asm.h 395-398) is the FIRST instruction after the poll call and it is itself a WRITE of r8.  A walk that
starts at the call's next instruction therefore stops at once and calls r8 DEAD -- and the first reading over 54
witnesses said exactly that, r8 DEAD at all 2889 safe points, which would have retired a standing 161-unrepaired
finding on an artifact.  A DETECTOR ARM FAILS OPEN: it reads as "there was never a bug here" (CLAUDE.md, ceo
CEO-480/481).  So for a register the reload DEFINES, the walk begins AFTER the reload block, because the gate's
question is about the RELOADED value.  Arm (g) of --selftest is that fail-once and it is the arm that matters.

USAGE
  util_gc_poll_register_liveness.py [PROG ...]        one or more corpus programs (default: the witness set)
  util_gc_poll_register_liveness.py --asm FILE.s      grade an already-emitted .s
  util_gc_poll_register_liveness.py --selftest        fail-once and pass-once on a planted stream
  --regs r8,r12,...       which registers to follow (default: the anchor, the three sigma pins, r12
                          and rbx).  ⛔ r12 AND rbx ARE IN THE DEFAULT BECAUSE LEAVING THEM OUT WAS
                          THE FIRST READING'S MISS: bb_match_end passes r12 as a const char * and
                          hb_blob_span_defer WRITES through it at four existing safe points, all four
                          invisible to a reader that followed only r8 and the sigma pins.
