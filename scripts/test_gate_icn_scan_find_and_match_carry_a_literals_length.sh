# test_gate_icn_scan_find_and_match_carry_a_literals_length.sh -- hq_icon, 2026-09-24, MODE DECTET.
#
# WHAT WAS THERE. The scanning find() and match() boxes (bb_scan_find.cpp, bb_scan_match.cpp) took a literal needle's length
# from strlen() on its C string, although the lowerer attaches the literal's true length as its IR_LIT_INTEGER operand
# (lower_icon.c icn_attach_lit_len). So a literal carrying a NUL was cut at it -- find("a\x00") found "a", match("ab\x00")
# answered 3 where iconx answers 4 -- and a NUL-FIRST literal measured 0 and fell into find's "unhandled" branch, which
# emitted an alpha and a bomb but NO beta: `every find("\x00")` aborted m3 at emit time with an unresolved forward
# reference to its beta label. The same branch took find("") and every literal needle longer than 32 bytes, so any Icon
# program scanning for either crashed the compiler in m3. The variable-needle path measured the needle with strlen() too,
# although rt_scan_needle hands the carried length back in rdx.
#
# WHAT IS HERE. The emit case reads the literal's true length from its length operand into op_ival and both templates unroll,
# compare and emit their data (.string with its length) over it; find takes the literal path only for 1..32 true bytes and
# otherwise its general path, which now stores rt_scan_needle's rdx instead of calling strlen; both unhandled branches
# define their beta so a refusal can never leave a dangling label.
#
# ARM. Fifteen witnesses (eight needles for find under `every`, seven patterns for match) over a subject that carries NULs,
# graded against the LIVE oracle (icont/iconx 9.5.25a) in both media, byte for byte. A witness the oracle does not run
# refuses the gate rather than passing it.
