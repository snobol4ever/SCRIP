# test_gate_sno_deferred_goto_from_match_inside_define.sh -- A COMPUTED GOTO OFF A MATCH, INSIDE A DEFINE BODY,
# LEAVES THE STATEMENT AT THE RIGHT STACK DEPTH.
#
# WHAT THIS IS: SNOBOL4 `:S($('L.' OP))` -- a goto whose TARGET IS COMPUTED at run time -- taken from the
# SUCCESS branch of a pattern match, in a statement inside a DEFINE body. The transfer lands on a label in that
# same body, which then runs `:(RETURN)`. Before the cure every b-arm died SIGSEGV 139 in BOTH modes, jumping to
# a value like 0x300000002 -- a DATA word read as a return address, because the deferred-goto chain left the
# stack 16 or 48 bytes deep and :(RETURN) popped the wrong slot.
#
# ⛔ THE DISCRIMINATOR IS THREE-FACTOR AND EVERY c-ARM REMOVES EXACTLY ONE FACTOR. All three were measured, and
# each c-arm was GREEN BEFORE the cure and must stay green after it:
#   c1  the target is a PLAIN LABEL, not computed        -- the same match, the same S branch, no crash
#   c2  the goto is UNCONDITIONAL, not on the S branch   -- computed target, still no crash
#   c3  the whole shape at MAIN LEVEL, not in a DEFINE   -- no activation to return from, no crash
#   c4  the statement is an ASSIGNMENT, not a match      -- no match watermark, no crash
#   c5  the transfer is on the F branch of a FAILED match -- the failure arm was never affected
# A gate carrying only the b-arms would pass just as happily if a later change stopped emitting deferred gotos
# altogether; the c-arms are what force the shapes to stay distinguishable.
#
# ⭐ b1 vs b2 IS THE PAIR THAT PINS THE ARITHMETIC, and it is why one b-arm would not have been enough. They
# differ ONLY in whether the match REPLACES (`X 'a' = ''` vs bare `X 'a'`), which changes the statement's own
# zeta depth from 32 to 16 while the deferred chain adds 48 to both. The correct pop is 64 in BOTH. So a rule
# keyed on the full depth is right for exactly one of them, and a rule keyed on the watermark is right for
# neither: the residual has to be the STATEMENT depth above the match watermark. Two earlier formulas were
# written, built and REFUTED on this pair before the third stood -- `full - wm` fixes b1 and leaves b2 dead,
# plain `full` does the reverse. Keep both arms or the next reader will re-derive a formula that fits one.
#
# ⛔ NON-VACUOUS BY CONSTRUCTION, AND CHEAP TO RE-PROVE: SCRIP_ZD_DEFER_EXIT=0 restores the pre-cure bytes off
# THE SAME BUILD, so no rebuild is needed to see the arms flip. Every b-arm is RED under it and every c-arm
# stays GREEN. Prove that before trusting a green:  SCRIP_ZD_DEFER_EXIT=0 bash <this file>
#
# ⭐ WHY A GATE AND NOT A BOARD LINE: the SNOBOL4 master board CANNOT SEE this cure. Censused at the landing,
# ZERO of 32 sampled corpus SNOBOL4 programs outside the packages reach the arm, and Icon and Prolog emit no
# goto_deferred box at all (0 in 72 programs). The payload that does reach it is aisnobol WANG.sno, which the
# board does not carry. A cure whose only witness lives in one package program needs a gate or it is unpinned.
#
# EXIT: 0 all arms match SPITBOL. 1 an arm regressed. 2 UNPROVEN (no built scrip / no oracle).
