# scripts/test_gate_gc_the_stack_is_completely_accounted_at_every_collection.sh -- THE STACK COMPLETENESS
# GATE (coo, CEO-1099 rank 0, 2026-09-21).
#
# THERE ARE ONLY TWO WAYS TO MAKE A HARDWARE-STACK REGION TRAVERSABLE: DELETE IT OR DECLARE IT.  Eight
# classes sit on the stack at a collection -- emitted box frames, the zeta-SPINE on RSP, gcc C frames, our
# own asm shim frames, jmp_buf register copies, live callee-saved registers, coroutine stacks, and the
# sanctioned driver frames below main.  Today NOTHING accounts for every byte, which is why COMPLETE is an
# opinion rather than a verdict.  This gate is the verdict.
#
# ⛔ IT COUNTS NOTHING OF ITS OWN.  gc_walk_print (src/runtime/rt/gc_heap.c) already prints, behind
# SCRIP_GC_MAPS, the five quantities that ARE completeness -- nomap, notab, i_raw_heap, h_raw_heap,
# s_raw_heap -- on its [GC-WALK] line.  This gate PARSES that line, the way test_gate_no_c_to_bb_ratchet.sh
# parses the gate it depends on.  A second reader of one quantity drifts, and the drift then prints as a
# property of the world rather than of the reader.
#
# ⛔⭐ WHY IT IS A RATCHET AND NOT A PASS/FAIL, AND THE HONEST ANSWER TO "CAN THIS COUNT REACH ZERO BY
# DESIGN?" (test_gate_term_wordref_ratchet.sh's question, which is what makes this shape legitimate):
# YES -- every unaccounted region is DEBT that is to be deleted or declared, and 0 is the intended terminal
# value.  But it is NOT zero today and pretending otherwise would be the false clearance this row exists to
# prevent: MEASURED 2026-09-21 over all 826 icon master entries at 64 KB / stress 1, 149 programs carry a
# nonzero completeness counter across 163 DISTINCT NAMED FRAMES and 133648 raw-heap word sites, the largest
# single region being the SPINE of `main` (33633 sites across 100 programs).  So the gate pins the named
# remainder and goes RED when a NEW frame appears or a pinned one grows.
#
# ⛔ WHEN IT GOES RED IT NAMES THE FRAME, NEVER A COUNT.  A count without names cannot be triaged.  The frame
# name is the `graph=` field of the [GC-WALK-SPINE|HEADER|RAW] site lines, which is exactly where each of the
# three raw-heap counters is incremented (gc_heap.c:1130 s_raw_heap->SPINE, :1130 h_raw_heap->HEADER,
# :1147 i_raw_heap->RAW).
#
# ⛔ DEPTH IS PART OF THE VERDICT (CEO-1099).  A shallow witness reads nomap=0 and proves nothing: the ceo
# measured frames=1 nomap=0 i_raw_heap=0 on bench_icnstr_concat_table.icn and that is NOT evidence about deep
# stacks.  This gate DECLARES the depth its population reaches and REFUSES rc=2 if the run does not reach it,
# so a population that quietly got shallower cannot read clean.
# ⛔ AND A POPULATION THAT NEVER COLLECTED REFUSES rc=2 (CEO-1044).

# ── THE DECLARED POPULATION.  Deep witnesses, named, from the icon master.  Chosen by measured frame depth
#    (see the ONE_LINER at the foot), never by looking like they might recurse.
# ⛔⭐ THE POPULATION IS CURATED AGAINST THE RUNTIME'S OWN LINE CAP, AND THAT COST IS REAL.  gc_walk_site
#    stops after GC_WALK_LINE_CAP=48 site lines PER COLLECTION and reports the rest as `suppressed`, so a
#    deep-but-chatty witness names almost nothing: measured 2026-09-21, procedure_every_suspend_replace_7
#    reaches 36 frames over 216 collections and SUPPRESSES 204221 site lines while naming just 2 frames.
#    Witnesses are therefore chosen for DEPTH PER COLLECTION, not depth alone.  Measured candidates:
#      procedure_coexpr_every_replace_1   frames=11 coll=14   suppressed=23     rc=0   <- kept
#      procedure_every_suspend_replace_3  frames=6  coll=72   suppressed=0      rc=0   <- kept
#      procedure_coexpr_suspend_replace_3 frames=6  coll=262  suppressed=5      rc=1   <- kept
#      procedure_every_suspend_replace_7  frames=36 coll=216  suppressed=204221 rc=139 <- REJECTED, crashes
#      procedure_record_every_replace_4   frames=8  coll=2246 suppressed=117287 rc=0   <- REJECTED, chatty
# ⛔ A CRASHING WITNESS IS REJECTED ON PURPOSE: its evidence stops at an unknown point, so a clean reading
#    from it cannot be distinguished from a reading that never got deep enough to see anything.
# GC_STACK_WITNESSES overrides the population FOR THE FAIL-ONCE ARMS ONLY -- a detector arm that has never
# tripped reads as "there was never a bug here", and it is detector arms that fail OPEN (CEO-1099).

# ⛔⭐⭐ THE WITNESS ARENA IS A VARIABLE BECAUSE THE HARD CAP IS COMING AND 64 KB DOES NOT SURVIVE IT.
#   Lon 2026-09-21, in-chat to the ceo, verbatim: "Place a hard cap on the GC HEAP. Do not extend it."  The
#   ceo's working tree already carries it, and MEASURED AGAINST THAT BUILD (read-only, their binary, 2026-09-21
#   19:3x): procedure_coexpr_every_replace_1 and procedure_every_suspend_replace_3 complete at 64, 128, 256 and
#   1024 KB, while procedure_coexpr_suspend_replace_3 ABORTS rc=134 at BOTH 64 and 128 KB -- "[ZHP] HARD CAP
#   REACHED ... THIS REQUEST wanted 32767 payload bytes of block kind 215" -- and completes at 256 and 1024.
#   With the arena hardcoded at 64 this gate would read UNPROVEN(2) on every capped tree FOREVER, because a
#   crashing witness is rejected by design two blocks below.  That is how the gate's own DONE-WHEN refused on
#   the ceo's root today.  ⛔ AND THE DISTINCTION THE CAP FORCES EVERYWHERE: an abort that says HARD CAP
#   REACHED is a CAPACITY verdict about the arena, never a defect in the collector -- an item-4 band that
#   counts it as a grading lost will publish hundreds of false losses the day the cap lands.
#   ⭐ THE DEFAULT MOVES TO 256 AND THE EVIDENCE IS UNCHANGED, WHICH IS THE ONLY REASON IT MAY MOVE: measured
#   here on this tree at 64 and at 256, both read 348 collections across 3 witnesses, max frames 11 against a
#   floor of 10, THE SAME SEVEN NAMES, and PASS(0) -- only the word counts move (testio 879 vs 993, main 715
#   vs 763), which is the spread this gate already refuses to pin.  Set GC_STACK_ARENA_KB=64 to reproduce the
#   pre-cap reading.

# ⛔⭐⭐ THE cto FALSIFIED THE COLUMN AND THE RATCHET SURVIVED IT -- BOTH HALVES BELONG HERE (2026-09-21).
#    THEIR SWEEP: one binary, never rebuilt, one witness whose CONTENT never changed, varying ONLY THE LENGTH
#    OF THE INVOKING FILESYSTEM PATH, s_raw_heap read 3, 6, 3, 3, 6, 3, 6 -- bistable between two stack
#    layouts, on an input that has nothing to do with the collector, and they retracted a claimed cure of
#    6 down to 3 that was only two samples of those two states.  A gate asserting that column equals zero
#    would flap, and they deleted their own column arm rather than keep a number they could not trust.
#    ⭐ RE-RUN HERE AGAINST THIS GATE'S OWN RATCHET, because a finding about a statistic is not yet a finding
#    about a verdict: procedure_coexpr_suspend_replace_3, one binary, seven invoking-path lengths from 60 to
#    120 characters, s_raw_heap = 1602, 1745, 1602, 1783, 1641, 1642, 1735 -- THE COUNT MOVES BY 11% AND THE
#    NAME SET IS BYTE-IDENTICAL AT ALL SEVEN: {SPINE/main, SPINE/testio, SPINE/textgen}.  The whole gate,
#    run under TMPDIR path lengths 4 and 142, reads PASS(0) at both with every pinned count different
#    (main 756 vs 763, testio 956 vs 994, param 3 vs 4, stat 3 vs 2) and the same seven names.
#    ⛔ SO THE COLUMN IS NOT TRUSTWORTHY AND IS PRINTED, NEVER PINNED; the cto's own recommendation -- key the
#    verdict on a NAMED FRAME rather than a whole-stack sum -- is what this gate already does, and their
#    sweep is the strongest evidence yet that it is the right axis.  If a count is ever pinned it needs a
#    tolerance derived from that spread, not a number copied off one run.
# ⛔⭐ THE RATCHET IS ON THE NAME SET, NOT ON THE COUNTS, AND THAT IS A MEASUREMENT AND NOT A PREFERENCE.
#    Three identical runs of this exact population on one tree (2026-09-21): SPINE/testio read 853, 946 and
#    994; SPINE/main 775, 765, 763; SPINE/gen 16, 18, 18.  The COUNTS ARE NOT REPRODUCIBLE -- they follow
#    where the stress collector happens to fire -- so a count pin would flap red on an unchanged tree, and a
#    gate that cries wolf is worse than no gate.  THE NAME SET WAS BYTE-IDENTICAL ACROSS ALL THREE.  So a NEW
#    FRAME NAME is the regression this gate catches, and the counts are printed as the REMAINDER, labelled,
#    and deliberately not ratcheted.  If a count pin is ever wanted it needs a tolerance derived from this
#    variance, not a number copied off one run.
