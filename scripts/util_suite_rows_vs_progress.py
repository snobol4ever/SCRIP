"""util_suite_rows_vs_progress.py -- THE CROSS-LANGUAGE BATCH AUDIT (MODE line 2 under DECTET, CEO-775; ceo CEO-780a; coo
2026-09-16, row util-suite-rows-vs-progress-the-cross-language-batch-audit-lands-as-an-instrument).

After each batch every HQ's suite rows are on origin and AGREE with the progress DB; a disagreement is a row. This reads
every .github/SUITES.tsv row against /home/resources/progress/results.tsv ON THE ROW'S OWN TREE (column `tree`), over the
modes each program declares (its LAST outcome per mode; PASS only when every recorded mode reads PASS), and prints per row:

    key  row pass/total  DB pass/population  xpass  measurer  last DB reading  verdict

  numerator   row today_pass  vs  DB PASS (AND over declared modes)
  denominator row today_total vs  DB population = every program with a row on that tree, plus every entry of the suite's
              OUTSIDE sidecar not already there (a sidecar-named program is OUTSIDE whatever the DB called it; the same
              reconciliation test_gate_score_row_denominator_includes_xfails.sh uses, sourced from one table below)
  xpass       programs whose PASS rows carry the note `xfail` -- THE DB FOLDS XPASS INTO PASS AND A SUITE BOARD DOES NOT
              (hq_snocone 2026-09-16): a numerator gap EQUAL to xpass means stale xfail markers still on the suite (promote
              them, CEO-753); a gap with xpass 0 means the row is simply behind its tree or its runner counts differently.

VERDICT per row: AGREE · DISAGREE (numerator and/or denominator, each with the difference) · UNPROVEN (no DB rows on the
row's tree, named -- CEO-750: a row without per-program evidence is DARK wearing a number) · DEFERRED (no tree, a DEFERRED
criterion: gnu_fd, CEO-579). rc=1 when any graded row DISAGREES; rc=2 when zero rows are gradable; else 0. An UNPROVEN row
does not by itself make rc=2 (CEO-786 confirmed this reading for the sibling gate: a per-row rc=2 is a standing refusal).

--selftest builds a scratch SUITES.tsv, DB and corpus under mktemp: an agreeing row, a planted NUMERATOR disagreement whose
gap equals its xpass count, a planted DENOMINATOR disagreement, an UNPROVEN row and a DEFERRED row, and proves rc=1 naming
the planted rows with the xpass column, rc=0 once they are removed, rc=2 on an empty DB.

env: S4E_SUITES_TSV, S4E_PROGRESS_DB, S4E_CORPUS_ROOT redirect the three inputs (the selftest and gates use them).
