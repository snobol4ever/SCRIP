# test_gate_nv_set_fn_ir_ratchet.sh -- the DONE-WHEN of row perf-nv-set-fn-o0-overhead (item 3).
#
# ⭐ WHAT ITEM 3 IS: scope + land a cure for the variable-STORE fast path, or rule it explicitly not worth doing. Items 1 and 2 are CLOSED (item 1 by seat07, 100% of the then-50,492,413 Ir
# attributed; item 2 by seat01, the memo cache is a decisive -O0 win). This gate ratchets the store family's Ir so "a cure landed" becomes a measurement instead of a claim.
#
# ✅⭐⭐ THE RECIPE GAP IS CLOSED (hq_P 2026-09-04, measured). THIS GATE NOW GRADES THE QUANTITY THE ROW ACTUALLY NAMES. The previous revision profiled the COMMITTED roman.sno in mode-3 and pinned
# 122,092 Ir -- an honest number of the WRONG QUANTITY, and it said so in its own header. The committed program runs K = 1001..1010 (TEN iterations), so a direct callgrind of it totals ~35.6M Ir and is
# COMPILE-DOMINATED (__strcmp_avx2 12.65%, bb_emit_x86 8.80%): it profiles the COMPILER, not the roman kernel. THE SCALED RECIPE IS RECOVERED AND IS NOW EXECUTED BELOW -- it was never lost, only
# unrecorded: the row's GOAL line said "Measured N=20000, mode-4" all along, and the *BENCH marker at roman.sno:24 (kernel=ROMAN_RUN check=200 bud=500 flr=20) is what makes N reachable.
# ⭐ RECIPE, VERIFIED REPRODUCIBLE TO THE INSTRUCTION (two runs, bit-identical), ~5 s wall:
#     bench_wrap.sh roman.sno --mode=iter --n=20000   ->   scrip --compile   ->   gcc -no-pie + libscrip_rt.so   ->   valgrind --tool=callgrind on THE BINARY
# ⛔ --mode=iter, NOT --mode=time: a wall-clock deadline under callgrind measures the INSTRUMENT's throughput, not the kernel's (FINDING-2026-08-22-bench-harness-unmeasurable).
# ⛔ MODE-4, NOT MODE-3: mode-3 profiles compiler + kernel in one process, so ~67.5M Ir of compile swamps the signal. Mode-4 profiles the linked binary, where compilation has already happened.
# ⛔ N=20000 IS PART OF THE PIN, NOT A TUNABLE. Changing it invalidates the number. The scale is NOT arbitrary: it is the scale the row's own figures were taken at, confirmed by reproducing the
# published kernel total to within 0.02% (predicted 353,539,093 vs the row's 353,472,366).
# ⛔⛔ AND ROMAN IS **NONLINEAR** IN N, SO A SLOPE IS NOT AVAILABLE HERE AND bench_ir_slope.sh WOULD CORRECTLY PRINT `NONLINEAR`. Measured mode-4 store-family slopes: 588 Ir/iter over N=5000..10000
# vs 700 Ir/iter over N=10000..20000, a 19% divergence. The cause is in the kernel's own definition, not in the instrument: ROMAN_RUN(N) converts 1000+1 .. 1000+N, so the integers -- and therefore
# the numerals, and therefore the work per conversion -- GROW WITH N. That is why this row pins a TOTAL AT FIXED WORK and why N is part of the pin. (RULES.md § FACT RULES: a SLOPE is not a TOTAL.)
#
# ⛔⛔⭐ WHY THE PIN IS A **FAMILY SUM** AND NOT `core.c:NV_SET_fn` -- THIS IS THE LOAD-BEARING CORRECTION, AND IT IS NOT HYPOTHETICAL; IT ALREADY HAPPENED ONCE.
# At SCRIP 702e2d162 ("NV_CELL_IF_FASTSET_fn: one admission funnel for direct-cell stores") the FAST-PATH STORE -- which is precisely what item 3 targets -- WAS SPLIT OUT of NV_SET_fn into its own
# function. NV_SET_fn now CALLS it (17,628,085 Ir inclusive, 183,613x at N=20000). So the bare symbol's flat Ir fell 46,453,125 -> 12,853,648 (3.6x) WITH NO CURE TO THE COST CENTRE THIS ROW OWNS:
# the cost MOVED, it did not go away. A ratchet on the bare symbol would have read that refactor as a 3.6x win and invited a re-pin celebrating it.
# ⭐ THE GENERAL SHAPE, WHICH IS WHY THIS COMMENT IS LONG: AN ACCEPTANCE TEST A **REFACTOR** CAN SATISFY TESTS THE SPELLING, NOT THE MACHINE. It is the same defect hq_B caught on the sibling Prolog
# row, where `grep -c plc_ = 0` was closable by renaming ~200 refs of must-survive code. Here the refactor was innocent and useful (it cured two oracle-graded wrong answers) -- which is the point:
# NOBODY HAS TO BE GAMING THE GATE FOR A SYMBOL-KEYED PIN TO GO QUIETLY WRONG.
# ⭐ THE FAMILY IS THEREFORE EVERY FLAT BUCKET OF THE STORE PATH, SUMMED: core.c:NV_SET_fn + core.c:NV_CELL_IF_FASTSET_fn + the two DWARF-keyed inlined bodies (rt_protected.h:NV_SET_fn, the
# protected-pattern guard; gc_heap.h:NV_SET_fn, the write barrier). Summing by regex is deterministic and is robust to buckets appearing or merging. ⛔ Flat, NOT inclusive: `--inclusive=yes` prints
# TWO entries for NV_SET_fn (one keyed by absolute path, one by the .so) and a pin cannot choose between them without double-counting.
# ⛔ IF A FUTURE PASS SPLITS MORE WORK INTO A **NEW** HELPER, THIS FAMILY LIST MUST GROW IN THE SAME COMMIT -- the PASS path below says so out loud, because that is exactly when it will be ignored.
