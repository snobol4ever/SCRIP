# ⭐ RE-POINTED 2026-08-30 (seat12, repo-wide dead-suite-path consumer sweep): corpus/probe/ was
# deleted wholesale (corpus-crosscheck-probe-total-conversion) -- dropped from the sweep. ALL.sno
# (THE ONE FLAT MASTER, tests/snobol4/ALL.sno) is explicitly excluded too: it is a suite DATA file,
# one test per LINE, and is never a standalone program -- feeding it to `--compile` whole produces a
# few hundred spurious "duplicate label 'END'" errors that would otherwise pollute this histogram.
# ⛔ KNOWN LIMITATION, NOT FIXED HERE: excluding ALL.sno means the ~1500+ entries it now holds are
# invisible to this census (previously reachable as individual loose files) -- restoring that
# coverage needs the census to walk ALL.csv/harness-decompose the master, a bigger follow-up than a
# dead-path repoint. Flagged, not silently accepted as "the corpus is just smaller now."
