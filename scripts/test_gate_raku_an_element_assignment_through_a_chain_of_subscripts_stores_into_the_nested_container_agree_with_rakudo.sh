# test_gate_raku_an_element_assignment_through_a_chain_of_subscripts_stores_into_the_nested_container_agree_with_rakudo.sh -- `@a[1][0] = 9`, `%h<a><b> = 3`, `@s[$i][$j] = $i + $j`, `%h<a>[2] = 5`, `$x[1][1] = 9`, `@g[1][0] += 5`, `@g[0][1]++`: AN ELEMENT ASSIGNMENT WHOSE TARGET IS ITSELF AN ELEMENT; ALSO `@a .= sort` / `%h .= grep(...)` (THE METHOD-ASSIGNMENT ON AN ARRAY OR HASH), THE POSTFIX HYPER `@b>>++` / `@b>>--`, AND THE ITEM LITERAL `$[1, 2]`
# (row raku-every-suite-to-100-under-nonet-ceo-1266; found through the RakBench kernels mb-create_and_copy_2d_grid_cross, mb-create_and_copy_2d_grid_cross_unpack and the mb-visit_2d_indices family, which printed Nil/(Any) for the 128x128 grid, and confirmed on an existing nested array).
#
# THE DEFECT, measured against Rakudo: the tree for `@a[1][0] = 9` is TT_ARR_SET whose base is TT_ARR_GET(@a, 1), and the lowerer stores an element only when the base is a plain variable: for any other base it emitted SUCCEED, so the statement DID NOTHING and said nothing. `my @a = [1,2],[3,4]; @a[1][0] = 9; say @a` printed [[1 2] [3 4]] (Rakudo [[1 2] [9 4]]),
# `my @a; @a[1][2] = 5; say @a` printed [] (Rakudo [(Any) [(Any) (Any) 5]]), `%h<a><b> = 3` and `%h{"x"}{"y"} = 3` left %h empty, a matrix filled by `@s[$i][$j] = ...` read back (Any), and the read-modify-write forms (`@g[1][0] += 5`, `@g[0][1]++`) were lost the same way.
# THE CURE: (lower_raku.c rk_nested_elem_sets, a tree pass) a set whose base is an element read becomes a store, into the outer element, of the inner container updated by the new builtin __rk_elem_put(kind, current-inner, index, value) -- which creates an array or hash when the inner is undefined and pads new array positions with the Any type object -- repeated up the chain
# until the base is a variable, which the existing store handles; __rk_arr_set pads with (Any) too, as Rakudo prints a hole.
# TWO SMALLER DEFECTS ON THE SAME PATH (found through the xfail-adjacent probes and the RakBench kernel rc-9-billion-names): the method assignment `.=` worked on a scalar (`$s .= flip`) but `@a .= sort`, `@a .= map(...)`, `%h .= grep(...)` left the variable unchanged (the statement was the bare variable), and the postfix hyper `@b>>++` / `@b>>--` was swallowed the same way; stmt_plain builds the first as an assignment of the converted method result, rkb_postfix the second as `@b = __rk_hyper_incdec(@b, +-1)`. The literal `$[1, 2]` (an itemized array) was read as a variable named "[1, 2]"; r_term parses it like `$(...)` and takes the item of the bracket.
# NOT HERE (own rows, measured): ITEMIZATION IS NOT MODELLED (`my @u = $[1, 2]; @u.elems` is 1 in Rakudo and 2 here: `$[...]`, `$(@a)`, `.item` do not suppress flattening in list assignment); the aliasing binding `my @x := @todo[$x]; @x.shift` (rc-9-billion-names prints 15 15, Rakudo 15 176); `@a[1;2]` multi-dimensional subscripts and shaped arrays; an index expression with a side effect is evaluated twice; slices on the nested path (`@a[0][1,2] = ...`); the functional element store copies its array (O(n) per store -- the performance phase).
#
# THE WITNESS, graded in m3 (--run) and m4 (--compile + link) against a ref cut by Rakudo (/usr/bin/raku), then under SCRIP_GC_STRESS 1 3 5 in both modes.
# FAILED ONCE, measured on SCRIP 2adee34cf before the cure: every witness-mode pair red.
#
# EXIT: 0 every witness matches in both modes; 1 a mismatch or a crash on a witness; 2 REFUSED (stale binary, no gcc).
