# THE DONE-WHEN of row snocone-gc-the-snocone-share-of-the-unmapped-slot-population-censused-by-name-and-the-
# master-clean-under-forced-collection (hq_snocone, 2026-09-20), which is this lane's FIRST row under MODE TENET:
# MODE line 2 / CEO-1011 -- "COMPLETENESS DOES NOT OPEN IN A LANGUAGE UNTIL THAT LANGUAGE'S GC SHARE IS MEASURED
# CLEAN BY ORACLE DIFF AT THE TINY ARENA", the census NAMING and never counting, the master graded by ORACLE and
# never by rc. ⛔ RED ON ORIGIN TODAY at ARM 3 (one entry, eval_datatype_defer_1) -- see the gc gate beside it.
#
# ⛔⭐ ARM 1 IS THE ARM THAT MAKES THE OTHER TWO MEAN ANYTHING, AND IT IS HERE BECAUSE THE OBVIOUS READING WAS
# ALREADY WRONG ONCE THIS SITTING. The SncM master reads 336/336 both modes at SCRIP_HEAP_MB=1 -- and a census of
# [ZGC] regeneration lines over the same 336 entries at that same arena reads COLLECTORS=0, NON-COLLECTORS=336,
# TOTAL REGENERATIONS=0. Not one entry allocates a megabyte, so the tiny arena never collects and that green
# board is a statement about this corpus, not about the collector. A board over a population that CANNOT fail the
# way you are asking about is not evidence, and no rc, no denominator and no FAIL=0 anywhere in it says so. So
# this gate REFUSES rc=2 -- never reports green -- when the graded population did not collect.
#
# ARM 2 is the unmapped-store census over the same population. ⛔ IT IS READ BY ITS PRINTED VERDICT AND NOT BY ITS
# rc: that census exits 1 whenever it names ANY member, and snocone's members are all BELOW-REGION, which its own
# header says is where spine words live BY CONSTRUCTION and was never the discriminator (CFO-114/CFO-136). What
# this lane owes is class 2, NO-MAP -- the per-language class the cto assigned to the HQs in writing -- so NO-MAP
# is the number this arm binds on, and the BELOW-REGION members are printed, named and attributed to the cto's
# classes 1 and 4 rather than silently counted into a pass.
#
# ⛔⭐ THE BAND, NOT A POINT (ceo CEO-1024, measured by hq_raku who reversed their own green for it): the fleet
# graded GC health at stress 1, 3 and 5, and the raku master at stress 16 lost 65 gradings over 36 distinct
# programs that the 1-3-5 band called green. And the divergence points are NOT MONOTONE in the plant -- hq_snobol4
# has a witness red at 25 while green at 10, 12, 16, 20, 35 and 50 -- so a band chosen by where the last known red
# sat misses the next one. This gate therefore grades a BAND (SNC_GC_BAND, default "1 16": the most aggressive
# plant and one well above 5) and runs ARM 1's decidability question AT EVERY POINT, because a high plant collects
# LESS OFTEN and a band point can be inert for exactly the reason the tiny arena was. Widen it with
# SNC_GC_BAND="1 5 16 25 64 100" -- that full sweep was run 2026-09-20 and every point read collectors=336/336
# (1268, 681, 481, 357, 343, 338 regenerations) with a RED at stress=1 alone, so "clean above 5" here is a
# measurement and not a band artifact. ⛔ AND THE PLANT IS NAMED AS A VALUE IN EVERY LINE THIS GATE PRINTS:
# SCRIP_GC_STRESS unset IS stress 0, which is no forced collection at all, so a blank must never print as a blank.
#
# COST ~3 min per band point after a one-off extraction. This is a LANE gate, run by
# hq_snocone per landing; it is deliberately NOT in `make test` -- the blocking set is the shared resource that
# does not scale with seats (MODE line 2 CONDITION 2) and wiring a five-minute arm into it is the coo's call.
#
# ⛔⭐⭐ EXTENDED 2026-09-21 (hq_snocone, MODE TENET, ceo-1040 "item 4 of the GC commitment": ZERO GRADINGS LOST
# TO THE COLLECTOR, axes named not counted). What was here before this date tested ONE axis: SCRIP_GC_STRESS,
# arena PINNED at SNC_GC_ARENA (default 1 MB) for every point. That is exactly the hole hq_snobol4 found in
# hq_prolog's FIRST cut of SCRIP 46f348488: "a band varying the arena alone reads GREEN over an arena-insensitive
# stress-sensitive class" -- the mirror hole here is a band varying STRESS ALONE, which reads green over an
# ARENA-sensitive class, because it never once asks whether the shipped (512 MB) arena would have answered the
# same way. ADDED: ARM 0 (the shipped-arena, stress-0 baseline every other arm is diffed against -- this is what
# SncM's own 100% board already means, re-proven on THIS pinned tree rather than cited from a past one) and ARM 4
# (the SAME stress band, run at the SHIPPED arena instead of the tiny one). ONE AXIS MOVES AT A TIME, per
# ceo-1040 precondition 1: ARM4(N) vs ARM0 isolates STRESS ALONE (arena held at shipped in both); ARM3(N) vs
# ARM4(N) isolates ARENA ALONE (stress held at N in both) -- textbook one-variable-at-a-time, applied here the
# way hq_prolog's control/arena/stress triple applies it, adapted to a master small enough to run un-sharded.
# ⛔ WHY ARM0 IS NOT "ARENA=1MB, STRESS=0" (the naive control): that configuration was ALREADY MEASURED, by this
# very gate's ARM 1, to collect ZERO of 336 entries -- no entry here allocates a whole megabyte on its own. A
# comparison built on a cell that cannot collect would trivially read as agreement while testing nothing, the
# exact false-clean this gate's own ARM 1 exists to catch. So arena is tested where it is DECIDABLE: composed
# with a forcing stress, one axis moved against the other, never alone against an inert cell.
