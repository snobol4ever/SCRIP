# extension types store TRUE as ALL BITS SET (255/65535/-1/-1 read back as the target width), never as plain 1, and a value
# crossing out of one of these types through an explicit byte()/word()/longint()/int64() cast or a := into a plain boolean or
# another bool-family variable must land on the oracle's own number, not SCRIP's prior accidental 1.

# MEASURED 2026-10-01 by hq_pascal, both modes, row pascal-every-suite-to-100-under-nonet-ceo-1266. monitor_run.sh --oracle on
# corpus/packages/pascal/fpc_tests/test_cg_tcnvint1.pas bracketed the first divergence at its step 41 (stno 71): bb1 := TRUE then
# tobyte := byte(bb1) read INT=1 on scr against fpx's INT=255. Root cause, two sites in src/parsers/pascal/pascal.y: (1) mk_assign
# stored a boolean-valued RHS into a bytebool/wordbool/longbool/qwordbool-typed variable as the bare 0/1 the literal TRUE/FALSE or a
# comparison already produces, never widened to the family's all-bits pattern, and never narrowed back to strict 0/1 crossing INTO a
# plain boolean from one of these types; (2) the byte(x)/word(x)/shortint(x)/.../int64(x) typecast dispatch in mk_call was a pure
# passthrough for every integer target, truncating nothing, so a widened value crossing out through byte()/word() kept its full
# 64-bit pattern instead of the target width's own unsigned or sign-extended reading. A third site, the WriteLn/trace boolean-text
# formatter (pas_is_boolexpr gated on pas_is_boolvar, which bytebool-family names never populate), printed a bytebool/wordbool/
# longbool/qwordbool variable as a raw integer instead of fpc's "true"/"false" text. Cure: pas_var_is_boolfam(name) resolves a
# variable's declared type through aliases and answers its width (1/2/4/8) when it is one of the four family names; mk_assign widens
# (0 - rhs) into a bool-family destination from a strict boolean producer and narrows (rhs <> 0) crossing out into a non-bool-family
# destination; mk_call's integer-cast dispatch masks to the target width via iand and, for a signed target narrower than 8 bytes,
# sign-extends with the add-half/mod-full/sub-half identity (no ternary node, since lower_pascal.c never learned TT_TERNARY); the one
# remaining bare passthrough (boolfam targets, and every width-8/10 target) reshapes a bare bool-family TT_VAR argument with a +0 so a
# later mk_assign never mistakes a cast-collapsed value for a naked variable reference; the WriteLn/trace formatter's boolexpr gate
# grew an explicit pas_var_is_boolfam() arm and normalizes with (val <> 0) before the existing "false,true" enum-name wrap, which
# already assumed a clean 0/1 index.
#
# ARMS, both modes, each program's expected stdout and exit code cut LIVE from fpc -Miso: (1) conv -- bytebool/wordbool/longbool
# widened by := then read back through byte()/word()/longint()/int64(), both TRUE and FALSE; (2) mix -- wordbool/longbool narrowed
# into a plain boolean and into a differently-sized bool-family variable by :=, plus a bare WriteLn and a "not" of a bool-family
# variable; (3) plain -- a non-bool-family boolean expression (a comparison) through byte()/word() still reads exactly 0/1, pinning
# the pre-existing LOC_JUMP-style conversion this landing must not disturb. FAILS on the parent (bool-family TRUE reads 1 throughout
# arm 1, arm 2's narrowed boolean and bare WriteLn of a bool-family var are wrong, arm 3 was already right and stays right).
# FAIL_ONCE=1 corrupts arm 3's ref.
