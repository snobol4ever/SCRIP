#
# THE RULING (ceo CEO-1428, on the cfo's question): ONE PARSER, ONE DIALECT -- whatever sbl -bf refuses at compile time
# SCRIP refuses, in the main compile and in EVAL and CODE alike, never a looser EVAL. Three texts SCRIP accepted (row
# snobol4-scrips-parser-accepts-a-doubled-quote-a-comma-list-and-an-overflowing-integer-that-spitbols-compiler-rejects):
#   'a''b' and "a""b"     sbl 220 (missing operator): SPITBOL has no doubled-quote escape, the second quote opens a new
#                         literal with no blank before it. SCRIP's lexer read '' inside a literal as one quote (CSNOBOL4).
#                         The corpus holds one such site (programs/TZ/TZ-aloiddlp.inc, a C-style '\'').
#   1 , 2                 sbl 223 (invalid use of comma) at the top level; (1 , 2) is SPITBOL's selection and stays legal.
#                         The main compile already refused it; EVAL wraps its text in parentheses before parsing, which
#                         made the comma list a selection.
#   99999999999999999999  sbl 231 (invalid numeric item), and 9223372036854775808 and -9223372036854775808 too (the
#                         digits overflow before the minus applies). SCRIP's lexer took the token with atol and EVAL's
#                         numeric fast path with strtoll, both saturating at 9223372036854775807.
# THE CURE: snobol4.l drops the two doubled-quote rules and converts T_INT with an overflow check that raises "invalid
# numeric item" as T_REAL already did; eval_build_chain refuses a comma at depth 0 before wrapping; EVAL_fn's fast path
# raises on ERANGE or INT64_MIN. EVAL's refusal is then classified by eval_sb_syntax (e9213711a), so each reads sbl's
# number. 1/TAB(2), &BAL** '0' and 1.5- 10, cured earlier, stay in as guards.
# NOT COVERED, AND WHY: CODE of a text that does not compile FAILS SILENTLY in SCRIP where sbl raises the compile error
# (CODE(' X = (1') is 226 in sbl, &ERRTYPE 0 in SCRIP, on origin before this landing too) -- a class of its own, reported;
# so the CODE arm grades only that both refuse. The static arm grades refusal (exit status), not the error voice.
#
# Expectations are cut from sbl -bf AT RUN TIME, both modes. rc=0 clean · rc=1 a divergence · rc=2 REFUSAL.
