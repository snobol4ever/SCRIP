# test_gate_icon_features_and_preprocessor_symbols_agree.sh -- ICON'S FEATURE LIST AND ITS PREPROCESSOR
# SYMBOL TABLE ARE ONE FACT IN TWO FILES, AND UNTIL THIS GATE NOTHING ENFORCED IT.
#
# feats[] in src/runtime/keywords.c is what &features generates.  pre[] in src/parsers/icon/icon_lex.c is
# the set of predefined preprocessor symbols $ifdef sees.  Icon's own test suite CROSS-CHECKS THEM: every
# precheck(_JAVA, "Java") asserts the symbol is defined IFF the feature is present, so the two arrays are
# a single fact spelled in two layers -- runtime and parser -- with no build-time relationship at all.
#
# ⛔ WHY IT EXISTS (cfo 2026-09-08, row icon-feature-list-and-preprocessor-symbol-table-must-agree-and-
# nothing-enforces-it, ceo approved).  Curing the dialect row meant editing feats[] -- dropping "Java",
# adding "keyboard functions".  pre[] was NOT edited, because nothing said it had to be, and SCRIP then
# CONTRADICTED ITSELF OUT LOUD: "error: unexpected predefined symbol for Java" and "error: no predefined
# symbol for keyboard functions".  The ONLY thing that caught it was procedure_record_limit_replace_1, one
# entry buried in an 858-entry board, and it was found by stashing the change and rebuilding to get a
# baseline -- roughly three minutes and a full rebuild to learn what this gate says in a tenth of a second.
#
# ⛔ THE DIRECTION IS ASYMMETRIC, AND THAT IS MEASURED, NOT ASSUMED.  A symbol with no feature is always
# wrong.  A FEATURE WITH NO SYMBOL IS NORMAL: Arizona icont itself reports "environment variables" in
# &features and defines NO _ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES -- verified live against /home/resources/icon-master on
# 2026-09-08 with a $ifdef probe, alongside _KEYBOARD_FUNCTIONS and _PIPES which it DOES define.  So this
# gate refuses a symbol that names no feature, and merely REPORTS features carrying no symbol.  A gate
# broader than its rule gets disabled by the first person it blocks for a good reason.
#
# Hermetic, no build, ~0.1s.  ICON_FEATS_SRC / ICON_PRE_SRC override either source path so a caller can
# point it at a mutated scratch copy and prove the comparison is real rather than vacuous.
