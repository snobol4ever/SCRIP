# test_gate_m1_self_host_fixed_point.sh — MILESTONE 1's DEFINING PROPERTY, as a gate that can say NO.
#
# ⛔ WHY THIS DID NOT EXIST UNTIL 2026-08-22, WHICH IS THE WHOLE POINT: M1 is "beauty self-host reaches its
# fixed point -- output byte-identical to the input" (Lon s117: the checked-in file is its own oracle).
# `grep -rln '40971\|6f1671c0' scripts/*.sh` returned NOTHING. test_gate_sn7_beauty_self_host.sh is named
# for it but iterates 34 beauty_suite *_driver.sno witnesses -- a real check, and not this one. So the
# milestone the project is measured by had NO gate, and that is exactly how both of these went unnoticed:
#   * RUNG C-0 (m3 self-host emitting 278 bytes) sat un-caught until a human bisected by hand;
#   * the -O1/-O2 breakage sat un-caught because nobody ran the arm and nothing would have told them.
# A milestone with no gate is a milestone nobody is defending.
#
# ⛔ RT_OPT IS PART OF THE VERDICT. This gate grades whatever RT_OPT built out/libscrip_rt.so, and prints
# which configuration that was. A correctness verdict that does not name its configuration axis is a
# verdict about one arm reported as though it were about the product (hq_C, s258, learned the hard way).
#
# usage: bash scripts/test_gate_m1_self_host_fixed_point.sh [m3|m4|both]     exit 0 = the fixed point holds
