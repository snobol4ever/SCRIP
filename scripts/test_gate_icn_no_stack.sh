# test_gate_icn_no_stack.sh — GROUND ZERO 3 no-value-stack gate for the Icon BB path.
#
# THE RULE (RULES.md FACT RULE, ICON STACKLESS ONE-REGISTER FRAME): no g_vstack, no rt_push_*/rt_pop_*
# value-stack traffic in Icon graphs.  Each box's value lives in its own storage cell and consumers read
# the producer's cell directly (Proebsting); there is no operand stack anywhere on the Icon path.
#
# ⛔ SURFACE REPAIRED + BASELINE 127 -> 0 (s247, seat1, rung N-0).  The gate as written censused
# "${SRC}/templates/ ${SRC}/emitter/emit_bb.c".  emit_bb.c HAS NOT EXISTED FOR MANY SESSIONS: grep printed
# "No such file" to stderr, kept going with the surviving path, and the pipe to wc discarded its exit
# status — so half the named surface was silently absent and nobody was told.  Worse, the ceiling stayed at
# the s205-era BASELINE=127 while the measured count is 0 TREE-WIDE, so 127 new value-stack emissions could
# have landed with the gate still printing OK.  Two laws come out of that and are mechanized below:
#   (1) CENSUS A TREE, NEVER A FILE LIST — a directory cannot be renamed out from under the gate the way a
#       file can, and this gate's own rot is the proof.
#   (2) THE SURFACE MUST BE ASSERTED — if a censused root is missing the gate FAILS LOUD (exit 2) instead of
#       measuring whatever is left.  A gate that cannot see its subject must say so, never return OK.
# The family is now genuinely extinct (0 occurrences in ALL of src/), so this is a ZERO-ASSERT, not a
# ratchet: any reintroduction fails.  Negative-tested by injection at s247 (a planted rt_push_value in a
# template makes it exit 1).
