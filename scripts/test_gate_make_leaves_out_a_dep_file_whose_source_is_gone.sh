# test_gate_make_leaves_out_a_dep_file_whose_source_is_gone.sh -- AN INCREMENTAL MAKE SURVIVES A MOVED SOURCE (ceo CEO-1352; the coo's row
# build-an-incremental-make-survives-a-moved-source-a-dep-file-whose-source-is-gone-is-left-out-by-rule-not-by-name).
# MEASURED by the ceo 2026-09-28 15:2x CDT: the first incremental make after 481a8cd96 moved prolog_atom.c died "No rule to make target
# .../src/parsers/prolog/prolog_atom.c" in every objdir that compiled it before the move; the Makefile's -include cured ONE instance by
# name (re.c). THE CURE: scripts/live_dep_files.awk keeps a .d only while its object's first prerequisite exists.
#   1  the filter keeps a two-line .d (gcc -MMD's shape) and a one-line .d whose sources exist, and leaves out the .d naming a gone source;
#   2  END TO END: a fixture Makefile whose -include is the real Makefile's -include line (read from it, not restated) builds an object
#      whose source MOVED -- make -n prints the recipe from the pattern rule and never says "No rule to make target";
#   3  FAIL-ONCE: the same fixture with every .d included (no filter) dies "No rule to make target" -- the defect this gate exists to see;
#   4  the Makefile carries no by-name filter (grep -L on a source path) and names the awk.
# Hermetic (mktemp, no build, no corpus), under a second. EXIT 0 all hold; 1 an arm failed; 2 could not measure.
