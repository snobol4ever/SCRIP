# test_gate_pl_wall_us_arity1.sh -- CEO-567's precondition: a Prolog kernel must be able to SELF-TIME.
# by_name_dispatch.c registers wall_us/wall_ms at nargs==0 only (function style, the SNOBOL4/Icon
# calling convention). Prolog calls wall_us(T) at ARITY 1 -- a predicate unifying an output argument --
# so every call raises existence_error(procedure,wall_us/1). prelude_swipl.pl's own header states the
# assumption that went unverified: it exists "to supply the self-timing hooks SCRIP has as builtins".
# Under the kernel convention (RULES.md FACT RULE -- THE KERNEL CONVENTION) every kernel self-times, so
# this one shape mismatch blocks the entire Prolog speed axis; it was measured live on 10 of the 23
# corpus/benchmarks/prolog/bench/ kernels, all raising the identical existence_error.
# ⛔ THE ARITY-0 FORM MUST KEEP ANSWERING, AND ITS OWNERS ARE RAKU AND ICON -- NOT SNOBOL4 (coo 2026-09-19,
# row instrument-the-nineteen-non-gc-blocking-arms). This arm previously wrote its witness in SNOBOL4 and
# read FAIL with the subject behaving exactly as built: wall_us has NEVER been in SNOBOL4 scope. It is
# absent from sn4_is_system_fn, no commit in the tree's history ever added it there, and no .sno or .spt
# program in the corpus calls it -- the arity-0 form arrived as a RAKU hook (SCRIP 1b40ea1af) and
# by_name_dispatch.c states the split in its own line: "$wall_us/1 UNIFIES its argument (relational,
# out-parameter), Raku's wall_us() RETURNS a value". So the old arm accused a displacement that never
# happened. The witnesses are now Raku and Icon, the two frontends that DO own the arity-0 form, each
# required to return a positive monotonic microsecond clock, plus a plant proving the arm can say no.
# ⛔ REFUSES rc=2 (never rc=1) when it cannot measure: no ./scrip, no runtime .so, or a witness that
# neither succeeds nor produces the known defect signature -- "could not measure" is not "clean".
