# consolidated 2026-08-28 (tests-consolidate-prolog): the loose $CORPUS/$FAMILY_*.pl files
# this script used to glob were replaced by one suite pair (all 5 entries deterministic, no
# choice-point construct, none PZ-4-affected). A suite file is NEVER run whole
# (corpus_suite_harness.py's own docstring) -- delegate to `run`, which extracts and runs each
# entry alone in its own temp dir.
# ⛔⭐⭐ ABSORBED FALLBACK (hq_B 2026-08-30) — THIS SCRIPT'S REFUSAL HAD BECOME A PERMANENT NO-OP.
# Two generations of decay, each fix correct for its own moment and neither following the data:
#   gen 1  loose $CORPUS/$FAMILY/*.pl  -> emptied -> unmatched glob -> FALSE GREEN
#          (cured by the refusal below, exactly right at the time)
#   gen 2  the per-family suite pair itself was absorbed into the ONE FLAT ALL.* set
#          -> $SNO/$REF can never exist again -> the refusal fires FOREVER, grading nothing
# ⛔ MEASURED 2026-08-30: 24 rung graders sat at rc=2 "cannot measure" while owning 143 entries
# that were present and gradable in ALL.pl the whole time. rc=2 is the SAFEST hiding place a
# partial grader has — greens get audited and reds get triaged, but a refusal is DESIGNED to be
# non-alarming, so nobody re-examines it (hq_C's shape: a partial grader hides best behind a
# non-green verdict; neither audit path ever checks the DENOMINATOR).
# The fallback materializes this family back out of ALL.* and hands the SAME downstream logic a
# real suite pair, so each script keeps its own --modes and its own verdict accounting unchanged.
# ⛔ KEYED ON THE `origin` COLUMN, never the entry name and never a family-name prefix: origin is
# the durable provenance link and survives the renames consolidation performs (extract-family's
# own docstring: family membership comes from the CSV, not from a name convention).
