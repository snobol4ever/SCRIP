"""WHICH DESCRIPTOR KINDS CARRY A HEAP PAYLOAD -- ONE FACT, FIVE SPELLINGS IN ONE FILE, GRADED AGAINST ITS AUTHORITY.

THE ASK THIS ANSWERS, verbatim from the cfo (CFO-141, 2026-09-20, to the cto): "Build it as A DECLARED SUBSET
instead: the stack recognizer's kind set must be a subset of the heap visitor's, every kind in the heap visitor
must be either PRESENT in the stack recognizer or NAMED IN A DECLARED EXCLUSION LIST WITH ITS REASON, and an
unexplained divergence refuses.  That gets you one authority per fact without forcing false symmetry, and it makes
the DT_SNUL exclusion a written, reviewable fact instead of an absence the next reader reads as an oversight --
which is exactly how this one was born."

⛔ AND THE READING IS WIDER THAN THE ASK WAS.  hq_snobol4 found the divergence and described TWO copies; the cfo
added a third (gc_sniff_would_take) and said the same two kinds were missing from it.  Measured here rather than
counted from the telegrams: the fact is spelled FIVE times and the divergences are of four different widths --
gc_sniff_would_take is short by SIX kinds, not two, and gc_type_says_ref by five.  Those two are the INSTRUMENT
halves that the maps reporter's own divergence census is computed from, so a kind missing there does not lose a
value; it makes the census that would have found the loss read agreement.  That is the same class as an rc-shaped
arm over a silent wrong answer: an instrument reporting success while it is not looking.

WHY A DECLARATION AND NOT A DEMAND FOR EQUAL SETS.  The cfo's ruling of the same day (DT_X alone, not DT_SNUL)
turns on the roles being different: gc_visit_one is HANDED a descriptor and reads its type, while gc_cell_visit
GUESSES whether a word pair on the emitted stack is a descriptor at all.  Admitting the zero tag to a speculative
recognizer makes any zero word pair whose second word resolves into the arena look like a cell, on a stack where
zero is the commonest byte -- and rt_gc_visit_descr then REGISTERS THAT SLOT FOR FORWARDING, so the collector
would not merely mark something spurious, it would later REWRITE a word it guessed about.  A gate demanding equal
sets would force exactly that defect and then enforce it.  So: a subset, plus a written reason for every kind the
authority has and a copy does not.

⛔ AN EXCLUSION IS NOT A PARKING SPACE.  A kind recorded UNDER-CURE must name an owner and a row, and the day the
cure lands the entry is STALE and this instrument goes red until it is removed -- so the bookkeeping cannot be
skipped in either direction.
