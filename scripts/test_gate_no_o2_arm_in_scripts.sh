# test_gate_no_o2_arm_in_scripts.sh -- NO -O2 BUILDS OF SCRIP'S OWN RUNTIME, EVER (Lon s262 FACT RULE,
# RULES.md sec FACT RULES; Makefile:34 carries RT_OPT ?= -O0 verbatim).
#
# WHY THIS GATE EXISTS: test_gate_digest_matches_rules.sh polices the per-root CLAUDE.md digests, so a live
# -O2 arm could sit in scripts/ indefinitely while every digest read clean. Two did: jcon_selfhost_build.sh
# (PERF=1 -> RTOPT='-O2 ...') and build_o2_working_snobol4.sh (make libscrip_rt RT_OPT="$O2"). A rule policed
# only where it is WRITTEN DOWN and never where it is EXECUTED is a rule about documents.
#
# SCOPE, AND WHY IT IS NARROWER THAN "any -O2 in scripts/". The FACT RULE governs the optimisation level of
# SCRIP'S RUNTIME, not every compiler invocation a script makes. A bare grep for -O2 over scripts/*.sh matches
# 26 files here, and the great majority are legitimate and MUST stay:
#   - gcc -O2 -o tools/bench_rusage        the measurement harness itself. Building the stopwatch at -O0 would
#                                          add the stopwatch's own cost to every benchmark number.
#   - fpc -O2 / rival oracles              the rival compiled at ITS released default, which is the whole
#                                          basis of a fair two-number three-angle comparison.
#   - build_monitor_ipc_sync_library.sh    a separate IPC helper .so, not libscrip_rt.
# So this gate refuses exactly what the rule forbids: an -O2 reaching SCRIP's runtime optimisation level via
# RT_OPT= / RTOPT=. A gate broader than its rule gets disabled by the first person it blocks for a good
# reason, and then it guards nothing at all.

# DETECTION, in two stages, because the real offenders do not spell it literally. First cut of this gate
# matched the string -O2 near RT_OPT and got BOTH answers wrong at once: it flagged two lines of
# test_gate_digest_matches_rules.sh (that gate's own SEARCH PATTERNS for this very violation -- a detector, not
# a build) and it MISSED build_o2_working_snobol4.sh, whose arm reads RT_OPT="$O2" with -O2 assigned to $O2
# eleven lines earlier. A pattern that reports a detector and spares the offender is worse than no gate.
#   skip:    comment lines, and lines whose first non-blank character is a quote (a string ARGUMENT -- a grep
#            pattern or a documented example -- never a command).
#   stage A: shell variables assigned a literal -O2 in this file.
#   stage B: RT_OPT= / RTOPT= set to a literal -O2, or to a variable stage A found.
