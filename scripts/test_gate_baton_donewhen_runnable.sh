# test_gate_fleet_protocol_e2e.sh.
#
# THE QUESTION: hq_C's `done` REFUSES a row whose DONE-WHEN exits non-zero. That is correct and it is LAW 1.
# But it means a DONE-WHEN that is PROSE rather than a command can never exit 0 either -- bash returns 2 on a
# parse error, 127 on an unknown word -- so the row becomes PERMANENTLY UNCLOSEABLE. Safe-by-default, and
# useless: a seat does the work and then cannot close the row, for any amount of correct work.
# LAW 1 already says it -- "a COMMAND that can exit non-zero, never prose" -- and nothing enforced it.
#
# ⛔ THIS GATE NEVER EXECUTES A DONE-WHEN. Running them would build, test and profile the whole tree. It
# checks two static properties instead:
#   (1) does it PARSE as shell?                    bash -n -c
#   (2) does its first command word RESOLVE?        command -v, after skipping VAR=val prefixes
# Both are necessary, neither is sufficient -- a criterion can be runnable and still be a bad test (see
# `DONE-WHEN: true`, which this gate deliberately also refuses).

# zero-and-the-gate-that-says-so-is-unwired.md). Over ALL batons this gate counted 154 uncloseable criteria
# and was therefore unwireable: most belong to rows long since closed, where a dead DONE-WHEN costs nobody
# anything, and reding `make test` for nine seats over that backlog is how a true gate gets disabled rather
# than satisfied. Cross-referenced against QUEUE.tsv for rows a picker can actually SERVE -- state FREE or
# CLAIMED: -- the number that bites is 98, with 55 at rank 0 or 1.
# ⛔ THE CEO'S DISTINCTION, WHICH IS SHARPER THAN THE ASK IT ANSWERS: done-row batons are EXCLUDED BY
# POPULATION, never EXEMPTED BY STATE. An exemption says "this row may carry a dead criterion" -- a
# permanent hole that grows every time a row closes. A population says "the set at risk is the rows that
# can still be served", so a row leaves it BY BEING CLOSED rather than by being forgiven.
# ⛔⛔ ANTI-SILENCE, AND IT IS THE ARM THIS GATE WOULD MOST LIKELY HAVE SHIPPED WITHOUT. A gate whose
# population derives from QUEUE.tsv goes QUIET exactly when QUEUE.tsv breaks -- the file is not version
# controlled, it is rewritten by every seat, and a parse failure or a truncation would read here as "zero
# uncloseable rows", which is the shape of total success. So an unreadable queue and a ZERO-sized live
# population are both rc=2 REFUSALS, never a pass.

# before "fixing" it back. test_gate_orphaned_witnesses_do_not_grow.sh reds on a FALL as well as a rise, so
# that paying debt down forces the floor lower in the same commit, and that is right THERE because its
# population is the CORPUS: version-controlled, and it moves only when someone commits. This gate's
# population is QUEUE.tsv, which is not version-controlled and is rewritten by every seat on every claim,
# close, park and mint. MEASURED: the live count moved 98 -> 93 inside one sitting with nobody paying a
# single DONE-WHEN -- rows simply closed and new ones were minted. A strict ratchet over a population that
# volatile reds the build for nine seats several times an hour for reasons no commit caused, and a gate
# that cries wolf is a gate that gets commented out -- the exact failure the ruling exists to avoid.
# So: GROWTH IS RED, a fall PASSES and says loudly what the new ceiling should be. That is also the ruling's
# own wording ("red only if the count goes UP"). ⛔ THE COST, NAMED RATHER THAN DISCOVERED LATER: a fall that
# nobody banks leaves headroom, so a later regrowth back toward 93 is invisible. The cure for that is to
# bank it -- lower this number whenever you see the ⭐ line -- and step 3 of the ruling is CEILING=0, at
# which point the headroom problem disappears because there is none.
# ⭐ CEILING 93 -> 89 (hq_S 2026-09-11, same sitting, one landing later). SIX of my own rows were paid --
# every hq_S row in the finding's per-owner column, written as real commands and each PROVEN RED before
# being banked -- and the count fell by FOUR, not six, because the live population moved 439 -> 437 under
# the same edit. That is the volatility this gate's header argues about, visible in its own first ratchet
# move: the number is a property of the queue as much as of the debt, which is exactly why a fall here
# passes loudly instead of reding the build.
