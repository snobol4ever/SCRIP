# test_gate_area_smoke_grades_gimpel_drivers_the_boards_way.sh -- THE AREA SMOKE GRADES A GIMPEL DRIVER THE WAY THE GIMPEL BOARD DOES (the
# coo 2026-10-03, on hq_snobol4's report area-smoke-gimpel-selects-79-runs-0). MEASURED CAUSE: test_area_smoke.sh for SCRIP 9411ee7d2
# read packages/snobol4/gimpel selected=79 of 145, run=0, and exited 0, with AREA_SMOKE_TABLE_SUITE_DISAGREEMENT: the package's ALL.sno
# container still holds the 120 entries cut before CEO-1269, while ALL.csv names the 145 drivers the board grades, so every landing whose
# map reached lang:snobol4 smoked zero Gimpel programs. THE CURE: the smoke delegates the gimpel table to test_snobol4_gimpel_suite.sh's
# smoke mode (S4E_AREA_SMOKE_ENTRIES), which grades the named drivers through scorecard_snobol4.sh exactly as the board does and writes no
# progress row and no score row; the one-runner guard admits that mode; and a smoke that selects entries and grades none now REFUSES.
# WHAT THIS GATE HOLDS, over the shared corpus read-only (a smoke is not a board, CEO-1342), four driver witnesses, modes m3 m4:
# (1) the smoke says it delegated, and every witness reads m3=PASS m4=PASS;
# (2) the smoke wrote no score row: SUITES.tsv and SCORE.md byte-identical before and after;
# (3) FAIL-ONCE, the pre-cure smoke (the harness with SMOKE_DELEGATES emptied, grading the container) names the table/suite disagreement
#     and REFUSES rc=2 on grading none -- where the harness before this landing graded none and exited 0.
# rc 2 when the binary, the runner or a witness is missing, or the smoke refuses.
