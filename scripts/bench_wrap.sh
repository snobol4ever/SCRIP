# bench_wrap.sh -- BUILD A TIMED BENCHMARK ON THE FLY FROM A REAL STANDALONE PROGRAM.
#
#   bash scripts/bench_wrap.sh <prog.sno> [-o <out.sno>] [-H <harness.inc>]
#                              [--mode=time|iter] [--n=<iterations>] [--bud=<ms>]
#
# ⭐ WHY THIS EXISTS (Lon 2026-08-23 s265, in-chat, verbatim in substance: *"the system does NOT have
#   the stand alone program and has all that WRAPPER actually in the SOURCE CODE, and there is NO REF
#   files ... REVAMP the benchmark harness to have the *.sno file look like and BE the REAL program
#   application that can be run stand alone, and you can make temporary versions you build on the fly
#   with WHATEVER WRAPPERs you need"*).
#
#   BEFORE: every corpus/benchmarks/snobol4 program WAS the wrapper.  It set ZCHK/ZBUD/ZFLR, defined
#   ZBODY(ZKN), and ended in `-INCLUDE 'harness.inc'` -- no END of its own, no real output, not
#   runnable standalone, and its .ref pinned a harness artifact ("check: 1000") instead of the
#   program's answer.  Two carried no .ref at all.  The demo family was worse: those are REAL
#   applications (a Porter stemmer, a JSON deserializer) whose every OUTPUT had been DELETED and
#   replaced by a running sum, so a 163 KB oracle-gradeable answer became one integer.
#
#   AFTER: the .sno IS the application.  It has its own END, prints its own real output, runs under
#   `scrip p.sno`, `sbl -bf p.sno` and csnobol4 with no include path and no harness on disk, and its
#   .ref is that real output.  THIS script builds the timed version, into a temp file, when someone
#   wants a number.  The wrapper is now downstream of the program instead of inside it.
#
# THE CONTRACT -- one SNOBOL4 comment line, anywhere in the file, splitting it in two:
#
#     *BENCH kernel=<FN> check=<N> bud=<ms> flr=<ms> [batch=<K>]
#
#   ABOVE it   = the SETUP section: shared declarations, the pattern library, the kernel function.
#   BELOW it   = the MAIN section: the standalone application's own driver, and its END.
#   The line is a comment (`*` in column 1), so it is inert to every engine and the program stays
#   standalone.  It is the ONLY thing this script needs to know.
#
#   kernel=<FN>  a 1-arg program-defined function FN(N) that performs N repetitions of the workload
#                and RETURNS a deterministic census value.  It lives in the SETUP section, so both
#                arms have it, and the standalone MAIN uses it wherever that is the natural driver.
#   check=<N>    phase-1 iteration count -- fixes the deterministic check value.
#   bud=<ms>     phase-3 time budget.        flr=<ms>  phase-2 calibration floor.
#   batch=<K>    OPTIONAL -- pins the batch for a kernel that is not steady-state (string_concat),
#                where batch size is part of the workload and must not float.
#
# WHAT IT EMITS: SETUP verbatim, then the harness contract variables, then a one-line ZBODY shim
# that calls FN, then the body of harness.inc INLINED.  Inlined, not included: the generated file
# then has no include-path dependency at all, so it runs from any directory under either engine --
# which is what lets the temp file live in a mktemp dir beside nothing.  It also carries a `*` comment
# with the util_perf_context.sh CONTEXT line stamped at build time (load/cores/runnable/scrip+sbl
# procs) -- the same stamp goes to stderr as `stamp: ...`. Missing/failing util_perf_context.sh REFUSES
# the emission (rc=2) rather than silently shipping an unstamped twin.
#
# ⭐ THREE WAYS TO GET A NUMBER OUT OF ONE PROGRAM (Lon s265: *"we should have three options"*):
#     1. STANDALONE          -- do not call this script at all.  Run the .sno and time it from OUTSIDE:
#                               `/usr/bin/time -v ./scrip roman.sno`, `perf stat`, `valgrind --tool=callgrind`.
#                               The program prints its real answer, so the run is graded and timed at once.
#     2. --mode=time (default) -- fix the ms budget (--bud, default from the marker), COUNT THE ITERATIONS.
#     3. --mode=iter --n=N   -- run EXACTLY N iterations, no wall-clock deadline anywhere.  This is the arm
#                               to use under callgrind/cachegrind, where a deadline measures the
#                               INSTRUMENT's throughput instead of the kernel's
#                               (FINDING-2026-08-22-bench-harness-unmeasurable).
#   ⛔ --mode=iter BAKES `fixed_n` into the generated program instead of piping it on stdin.  That is what
#   makes mode 3 reachable for a DATA-DRIVEN benchmark at all: porter/json/claws5/calculator read their
#   corpus from stdin, so the old `fixed_n = INPUT` gate could never see a count for them -- they were
#   silently time-based-only and nobody had said so.
#
# ⛔ NO SILENT FALLBACK.  A program with no marker, a malformed marker, or a missing harness template
# is a NAMED FAILURE on stderr with rc=2.  The defect this replaces is exactly the invisible-skip
# class: test_bench_snobol4_timed.sh used to decide "is this a benchmark?" by grepping for the
# include, so a program that lost it vanished from the table rather than reddening it.
