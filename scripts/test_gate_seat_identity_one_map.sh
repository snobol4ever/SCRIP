#!/usr/bin/env bash
# test_gate_seat_identity_one_map.sh — seat identity is ONE map, and no runner may sign a board row with a
# placeholder (row `vendor-runners-stamp-unknown-seat-into-the-leaderboard-when-s4e-seat-is-unset`, hq_T
# 2026-09-04, GOAL routed by ceo CEO-175).
#
# WHAT WENT WRONG, AND WHY A GREP WAS NOT ENOUGH. Every runner spelled its measurer default
# ${S4E_SEAT:-unknown-seat}. S4E_SEAT is unset in a plain shell, so the vendor boards wrote the literal
# string "unknown-seat" into THE ONE LEADERBOARD — and it defeated the helper's own "an unattributed row is
# a claim with nobody behind it" guard by being non-empty. The cure was to DERIVE the identity from the root
# path instead of refusing harder, because the identity was never actually unknown: it is a fact on disk.
#
# ⛔ THE REASON THIS GATE EXISTS RATHER THAN A ONE-SHOT SWEEP. The cure left the root->seat map in THREE
# hand-synced copies — s4e_msg.sh, s4e_inbox_hook.sh, and util_score_row.py's derive_measurer(). They agree
# today. Nothing made them agree, and nothing would say so if one drifted: a drifted map does not crash, it
# signs somebody else's name to a measurement. So this gate pins the agreement itself, and pins the ONE
# place they are deliberately allowed to differ. It is the permanent form of that row's DONE-WHEN, which was
# a grep that could only ever be true once.
#
# ⭐ THE DELIBERATE ASYMMETRY IS PINNED, NOT PAPERED OVER. On an UNRECOGNISED root the bus falls back to
# basename($S4E) while the leaderboard REFUSES. That is correct in both directions and for opposite reasons:
# a seat with no name cannot be mailed, so the bus must invent one; a board row signed with a guess is
# exactly the unattributed claim this row exists to kill, so the board must not. Pinning it means a future
# "fix" that makes them agree has to be a deliberate act with a reason, instead of a tidy-up.

# passed GREEN because its roster stopped at claude_T. Four of eight HQs could not write THE ONE LEADERBOARD
# at all (every vendor run printed "REFUSED(2) ... root is not in the seat map" and "SCORE.md NOT UPDATED"),
# and the instrument built to catch precisely that drift reported no violation, because a gate only grades
# the population it is given. A hand-maintained roster is a second place a new root must be registered, and
# the whole point of this gate is that there must be ONE.
# So the enumerated roots now come OUT of the lifted case block itself. The header's asymmetry ruling is
# untouched: an UNRECOGNISED root must still diverge (bus invents, board refuses) and ARM 3 still pins that.
# The synthetic numbered seats stay spelled out — they are pattern arms, matched by [0-9] globs and named by

# ARM 5b — ⛔⭐⭐ THE EXEMPTION MUST NOT BLIND THE ARM, AND THAT IS PINNED HERE RATHER THAN RE-VERIFIED BY
# HAND. When the --dry-run exemption landed (hq_I, a6d794b68) it was proved correct in both directions on a
# scratch runner and then the proof was thrown away, so the NEXT person to widen this exemption inherits no
# instrument. An exemption is a hole cut in a gate; the arm that proves the hole is the right shape belongs
# in the gate, permanently, next to the hole. Three synthetic sites, both directions plus the sanctioned form.
# ⭐ THE REASON THIS CLASS EXISTS AT ALL (row gate-arms-and-their-own-fixtures-are-never-graded-against-each-
# other): ARM 5 and the --dry-run fixture in test_gate_score_row_rewrites_in_place.sh were each GREEN when
# they landed, a day apart, by the same owner, and were never graded against each other until a full run
# forced it -- at which point the gate that proves the leaderboard write-path is honest became the single
# thing reddening the blocking set for every HQ.
# ⛔ THESE THREE PROBES ARE THEMSELVES DELIBERATE NEGATIVE INSTANCES LIVING INSIDE A GATE FILE, i.e. exactly
# the shape that caused the incident. They are safe for ONE reason: ARM 5's scan excludes $SELF, and this is
# the only script in the tree that greps for `--measurer` across the others (verified 2026-09-05 -- every
# other hit CALLS it, none scans for it). ⭐ If you ever remove that self-exclusion, or teach another gate to
# scan for this flag, these lines red it. That is not a reason to delete them; it is the reason they are
# annotated here rather than left for someone to rediscover the expensive way.
