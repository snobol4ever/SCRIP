# test_gate_apply_reaches_every_formal_at_every_arity.sh -- APPLY('F',a1..aN) BINDS FORMAL i TO ACTUAL i AT EVERY ARITY.
#
# WHAT THIS IS: the regression arm of landing 4 of row gc-rt-c-c-to-bb-entries-leave-no-emitted-code-is-entered-from-c-in-rt-c-except-the-original-invocation
# (cfo 2026-09-19).  APPLY reaches a tiny-shim-eligible DEFINE'd procedure through rt_tiny_record_enter (src/runtime/rt/rt.c),
# the C-side half of the alpha face's calling convention: the caller lays the actuals in its own frame and hands the callee a
# record {nargs, gamma, omega, off_0 .. off_{N-1}} in rcx, where off_i is the byte displacement of formal i's actual from the
# caller's rsp.  The callee's role-4 SIG shim (bb_define.cpp, fnsig()) reads [rcx + 24 + 8i] for i < nargs and adds it to r8.
#
# ⛔ THE DEFECT THIS ARM PINS: rt_tiny_record_enter wrote a FIXED FIVE-QUAD record -- {nargs, gamma, omega, 16*nargs, 16} --
# which is the correct offset table for nargs 0, 1 and 2 BY COINCIDENCE (off_0 = 16N and off_1 = 16 are right only when N <= 2)
# and wrong for every higher arity: at N = 3 formal 1 read formal 2's actual and formal 2 read PAST THE RECORD, whatever the
# frame held there.  MEASURED on SCRIP f0368fb08: APPLY('F3',10,20,30) SIGSEGV rc=139 in BOTH modes, arities 0-2 correct, and
# the whole 1974-entry SNOBOL4 master green over it -- no board we own reaches a three-argument APPLY, which is why this arm
# exists rather than a board line.  The cure builds N offsets, and sizes the frame 24N + 40 (padded to keep rsp 16-aligned at
# the transfer) where the old shape allowed the record only 40 bytes above the actuals.
#
# NON-VACUOUS: arm P is a PLANT -- the same comparison run against a deliberately wrong expectation, which must be seen to
# FAIL, so a green above is a comparison that discriminates and not a harness that matches everything.  The stronger proof is
# the A/B: check out this file's parent tree, rebuild, and every arity >= 3 below is red.
#
# EXIT: 0 every arity matches SPITBOL in both modes.  1 an arity regressed.  2 UNPROVEN (no built scrip, stale binary, no oracle).
