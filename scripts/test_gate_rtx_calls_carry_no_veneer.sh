# test_gate_rtx_calls_carry_no_veneer.sh -- EMITTED CODE CALLS EVERY ASM-RUNTIME ENTRY BARE AND THROUGH THE GOT, AND EVERY
# CALL INTO THE C RUNTIME STILL CARRIES THE VENEER (cto 2026-09-23, CEO-1224, row
# spine-no-rtccb-veneer-on-any-call-into-the-asm-runtime-the-rtx-abi-preserves-r8-to-r11; Lon in-chat to the ceo, verbatim:
# "get rid of veneer for all RT ASM instances.").
#
# THE EMITTER HALF OF THE CONTRACT whose callee half test_gate_rtx_entries_keep_the_rtcc_four.sh proves. Before this row
# x86_rtcc_clob_raw() hand-listed thirteen asm callees and defaulted every other symbol to the full veneer, so 12,862 of
# 14,813 emitted calls into the asm runtime across the committed .s artifacts spilled r8/r10/r11 into rtccb and reloaded
# r8-r11 after (958 across this gate's thirteen witnesses at SCRIP 8a2e9bdff). The list is now DERIVED: the emitter asks
# rtx_entry_is(), which scans the rtx_entry_names section RTX_FUNC and RTX_ENTRY write.
#
# FOUR READINGS over two mode-4 compiles per language (the first two corpus/benchmarks programs of each of the seven):
#   (a) veneered calls into a registered entry -- a write-back into rtccb before, or a reload after, LOOKING THROUGH up to six
#       intervening moves that do not touch rtccb (hq_runtime 2026-10-07, on the cto's word: the bb_call_fn by-name road put a
#       mov ecx between its write-back and its call_bare and the adjacent-line read never saw it) -- must be 0, beyond the
#       DECLARED count (a2): the by-name road's hand veneer into rt_call_bid_sn4, measured 10 over the eight
#       benchmarks/snocone/parsers chains this gate also compiles, a ceiling that may only fall;
#   (b) calls into a registered entry through a PLT slot or a bare symbol must be 0: a lazily bound slot resolves through
#       _dl_runtime_resolve, which jumps to the callee through r11, so the FIRST call of every entry would hand the callee a
#       clobbered r10/r11 to "preserve" (mode 4 emits call qword ptr [rip + sym@GOTPCREL]; mode 3 calls by address);
#   (c) calls into a registered entry through the GOT must be > 0 -- the witnesses did reach the asm runtime;
#   (d) veneered calls into the C runtime must be > 0 -- the control: the veneer was kept where the callee is gcc's.
# NEGATIVE-TESTED IN EVERY RUN: one witness is recompiled under SCRIP_RTX_PLANT_VENEER=1, which hands the asm entries back
# the full veneer, and reading (a) must then be > 0 -- a count that cannot see a veneer when one is planted proves nothing.
