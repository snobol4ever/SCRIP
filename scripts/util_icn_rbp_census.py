"""util_icn_rbp_census.py -- ICN-FB-0: the Icon rbp instrument.

WHY THIS EXISTS AND WHY IT IS NOT util_rbp_region_census.py.  That instrument (FLATDISP-9)
answers the SNOBOL4 question: "does any reference name a base the prologue never established?"
It deliberately EXCLUDES seeded [rbp+N] refs, on the stated grounds that "no frame-pointer rung
can ever remove these, so counting them makes zero unreachable."  THAT ARGUMENT DOES NOT HOLD
ON ICON.  Lon's s204 directive is precisely that the seeded refs must go: "ensure that ALL
operands in EVERY BB is accessed via RSP, NOT RBP.  The only purpose sanctioned for RBP
indexing is HOUSEKEEPING."  On Icon a seeded data ref is removable -- by moving its GRAPH off
the pin -- so it is the ratchet target, not an exempt class.  The two instruments therefore
answer different questions and both are needed; this one lives BESIDE, never inside.

THE FOUR CLASSES (s204 census vocabulary, made mechanical here):
  A CEREMONY  -- prologue seed (`mov rbp, rsp`), caller-rbp save/restore into the header pad,
                 frame-chain walk (`mov rbp, [rbp+-N]`), `push/pop rbp`, `mov rsp, rbp`.
                 The ONLY population the directive sanctions.  ICN-FB-3's gate requires this
                 count to be EXACTLY UNCHANGED across a conversion step: if ceremony moves by
                 even one instruction the step touched a class the directive protects.
  C DATA      -- rbp as a memory BASE for an operand read/write: [rbp+N] / [rbp-N] that is not
                 ceremony.  THE CONVERSION TARGET.  This is what ratchets.
  D SCRATCH   -- `mov rbp, [<gpr> + N]`, rbp as a plain scratch destination.  Measured 0 on
                 Icon at s204 and re-measured 0 here; excluded from the ratchet for the same
                 reason the SNOBOL4 gate excludes it (no frame rung can remove a scratch use).
  DRIFT       -- a class-C ref inside a region whose prologue NEVER seeded rbp.  Such a ref
                 reads the CALLER's frame.  This is the s188/s189 defect class (Icon 250->236,
                 SNOBOL4 295/294->221/219, Prolog 164->120).  MUST BE 0; it is a real
                 zero-assert, not a ratchet, and it is inherited from FLATDISP-9's argument.

DRIFT is a subset of C, reported separately.  A conversion step that lowers C by creating
DRIFT has not converted anything -- it has broken the frame -- which is exactly why both
numbers are printed side by side and only one of them is allowed to be nonzero.
