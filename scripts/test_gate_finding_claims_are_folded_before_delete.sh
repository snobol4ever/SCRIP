# test_gate_finding_claims_are_folded_before_delete.sh -- A FINDING'S MEASURED CLAIMS SURVIVE ITS DELETION
# (RULES.md line 31; Lon 2026-09-18 in-chat to the cto, verbatim: "You can use as many FINDING files as you want. I'll
# just delete them periodically. We should probably do a summarization when I delete."; ceo CEO-859/861.
# Row: finding-summarization-gate-refuses-to-delete-an-unfolded-cited-finding.)
#
# ⛔ WHAT THIS GATE DOES NOT DO, STATED FIRST BECAUSE IT IS A DESIGN DECISION AND NOT AN OMISSION: it does NOT red on the
# unfolded citer links standing in the tree today.  The gate directly above it in this directory
# (test_gate_findings_live_in_the_findings_directory.sh) was renamed FROM a gate that encoded a rule's POLARITY, and it
# went red in EVERY seat's preflight the moment the law flipped -- a fleet-wide landing block created by a law change.
# The INVARIANT here is not "no unfolded citation exists" (whose cure is another seat's writing, on their schedule); it is
# "no FINDING was DELETED while a live row still cited claims that went with it".  That is naturally zero on a clean tree
# and reds exactly when the damage is done.  The standing links are REPORTED with their count, and the report is not a
# verdict.  ⛔ AND A NATURALLY-ZERO INVARIANT IS THE EASIEST KIND OF VACUOUS GREEN, so arm 10 plants a real deletion in a
# scratch clone and requires the detector to SEE it: without arm 10, arm 9's zero would be indistinguishable from a
# detector that reads nothing.  That is the whole lesson of the ten scripts the cto re-measured at HEAD this morning --
# test_gate_ir_field_discipline scans nothing, prints HARD TOTAL = 0 / PASS, and then recommends tightening the target.
#
# Hermetic: scratch git trees under mktemp, no build, no corpus, no network.  Population printed per arm.
# rc: 0 all arms pass · 1 an arm failed · 2 the harness could not grade (no python3, no sweep, clone failed).
# FAIL_ONCE=1 points the real-tree arm at a scratch clone holding a deleted-unfolded FINDING, proving THIS GATE reds.
