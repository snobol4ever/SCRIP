# test_gate_gc_a_bignum_held_only_in_a_heap_aggregate_survives.sh -- THE DT_BIG ARM OF gc_visit_one, THE STRESS BAND, BOTH MODES, THE TINY ARENA.
# ⛔ THE MEASURED DEFECT (ceo 2026-09-19, CEO-952; the cto found the missing arm while building the E switch and it is red on main WITHOUT E):
# gc_visit_one's switch had no DT_BIG case, so a bignum descriptor fell to `default: return;` and its BIG_t block was never marked and its
# holder slot never registered for relocation.  hb_wsb_bignum.icn did not see it because it holds its bignum in a STACK local, where the
# conservative sweep finds the block by value; gc_kind_witnesses.tsv did not see it because that table is keyed by BLOCK KIND and HB_WSB
# already had a witness.  The axis nothing tested is the HOLDER TAG: a value whose only holder is inside a heap aggregate is reachable
# ONLY by gc_visit_arblk/gc_visit_tbblk -> gc_visit_one, and a missing tag arm there is a silent loss no stack sweep can cover.
# MEASURED ON MAIN AT 41323bc8e, SCRIP_HEAP_MB=1: stress 0 green both modes; stress 1 WRONG DIGITS both modes (L2..L6 alias one reclaimed
# block); stress 3 and 5 SIGABRT rc=134 both modes, aborting on a 5790260276-byte request -- a limb count read through a dangling pointer,
# which is the [ZHP] "CORRUPTED LENGTH" path.  With the arm: 16 of 16 green (stress 0,1,3,5 x m3,m4 x arena 1 MB and 512 MB).
# The .ref is cut from the Arizona oracle (icont -s -x), never from ./scrip.  A stale binary or a missing witness REFUSES rc=2.
