# util_package_shipped_is_runner_written.sh — PER LANE: does every package in this language's V cell take
# its SHIPPED population from its own runner's PACKAGE_INVENTORY clause, or from a number somebody typed?
#
# Row package-shipped-per-lane-printed-by-the-runner-not-transcribed (hq_T). This is that row's DONE-WHEN,
# as an instrument rather than a shell one-liner in a baton, for the reason the row itself is about: a
# criterion that lives as prose in one file is a criterion nobody can re-run.
#
# ⛔⭐ WHY IT DOES NOT GREP FOR THE STRING `PACKAGE_SHIPPED`, which is what the minted DONE-WHEN did
# (`grep -c PACKAGE_SHIPPED .github/SCORE.md >= 1`): that criterion is satisfied by TYPING THE NAME OF THE
# TRANSCRIBED DICT ONTO THE LEADERBOARD, and it can never be satisfied by curing the defect, because the
# cure removes every reason for that token to appear anywhere near the board. ⭐ A criterion whose only
# passing state is the defect's own name is worse than no criterion: it reads as rigour and rewards the
# wrong edit. So this asks the READER instead -- util_score_row.py's own work lines, which name every
# package that fell back to the dict and every package whose clause it could not find.
#
# Usage: bash scripts/util_package_shipped_is_runner_written.sh [lang ...]   (default: every lane in the table)
# rc=0 every named lane is runner-written · rc=1 at least one is not · rc=2 CANNOT MEASURE (no row, no board)
