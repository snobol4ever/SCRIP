# test_gate_driver_extension_table_lives_once.sh -- THE CLOSED SOURCE-EXTENSION LIST LIVES ONCE, AND AN
# EXTENSION NOT IN IT REFUSES RATHER THAN SELECTING A PATH.  CEO-604, on hq_U's .sbl finding
# (FINDING-2026-09-12-hq_U-an-unknown-source-extension-selects-a-different-emit-path-instead-of-refusing-
# and-a-passing-ablation-explained-one-program-of-twenty-four.md).
#
# ⛔ WHAT IT COST BEFORE THE RULING.  src/driver/scrip.c spelled the extension set twice and the two
# spellings disagreed: the dispatch knew .sno .sc .reb .spt, the usage string printed .sno/.spt .icn .pl
# .sc .reb and omitted .raku and .pas WHICH THE DRIVER ACCEPTS.  Neither was a refusal path.  `.sbl` --
# SPITBOL's own source extension, and what all 36 files of the reference implementation's own test suite
# are named -- was in neither, so every one of them compiled down a path never meant for it: 24 aborted in
# bb_emit_end on a label='RETURN' that mode 4 resolved fine, thousands of sites from the dispatch that
# caused it, and the first reading of that blamed codegen.  One line fixed it and x64tests went 6/36 to
# 18/36 (SCRIP 35bf3ab90).  ⭐ THE GENERAL FORM IS THIS TREE'S OWN, TWICE OVER IN CLAUDE.md: an
# instrument that RESOLVES a name it cannot recognise instead of REFUSING reports the wrong case as a
# working one -- the seat-identity hook falling through to basename, `command -v icont` answering "is it
# on PATH" read as "does it exist".  This is that defect in the driver.
#
# THE ARMS, all behavioural -- the gate runs the binary and reads what it does, never greps the source.
# A source grep would pass a tree that had two agreeing lists, which is the state this ruling forbids:
# two lists that agree today are one edit from two lists that do not.
#   1  the usage NAMES every extension it accepts: a scratch file of each extension the usage prints is
#      NOT refused with the unknown-extension diagnostic (it may fail for any other reason -- a .pas file
#      full of SNOBOL4 is a parse error, and that is not this gate's business).
#   2  an extension the usage does NOT print is REFUSED rc=2, and the refusal NAMES the list.
#   3  .raku and .pas appear in the usage (CEO-604 names them: they were the measured omission).
#   4  the two readers print the SAME set -- the refusal diagnostic's list and the usage's list are
#      byte-identical, which is what "lives once" means observably.
#   5  a file with NO extension is still SNOBOL4 and is not refused, and a path whose DIRECTORY carries a
#      dot does not have that dot read as the file's extension (`/tmp/dot.dir/prog`).  ⛔ ARM 5 IS NOT
#      DECORATION: the pre-ruling code took strrchr over the WHOLE PATH, so a refusal added without the
#      basename fix would reject every no-extension program under any dotted directory -- a new false
#      refusal introduced by the cure for a false acceptance.
#
# REFUSES rc=2 when it cannot measure (no binary, stale binary, mktemp failure).  Never greps a number it
# did not produce: the accepted set is read from the running binary's own usage output every run.
