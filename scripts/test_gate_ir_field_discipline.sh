# test_gate_ir_field_discipline.sh — IR_t FIELD-DISCIPLINE gate for GOAL-IR-IMMUTABLE-EMIT.md.
# JCON discipline: each IR_t value field holds ONE kind of thing. A field NEVER smuggles a pointer
# (children live in operands[] / their own graph, never in an int64 via (intptr_t)); dval is a REAL
# LITERAL, never a discriminant tag (subtypes are op values, per JCON's distinct records). This gate
# is the FORCING FUNCTION: once counter is deleted and {sval,ival,dval} become a union, the type
# system itself forbids these; until then this gate counts the debt and FAILS if it grows. The per-
# language LOWER sessions rebuilt after the field-whack MUST keep this at/under the TARGET — there is
# NO avenue to re-smuggle. Ratchet TARGET down to 0 as constructs convert to the flat operands+edge model.

# THE CLASS (coo 2026-09-18, on the cto's re-measurement of seat10's 2026-08-23 list).  The -d test above shows
# the author already saw this defect class -- but it asks whether the DIRECTORY EXISTS, which is the narrower
# question, and the injection harness creates src/ EMPTY.  So LIVE() yielded nothing, every scan returned 0, and
# HARD=0 was compared against TARGET=119.
# ⛔ A VACUOUS HARD-ZERO GATE MERELY LOOKS CLEAN.  A VACUOUS RATCHET LOOKS LIKE A 119-POINT WIN AND THEN PRINTS
# AN INSTRUCTION TO RATCHET THE TARGET TOWARD 0 -- so acting on this gate's own printed advice would entrench a
# false target-reached permanently, and it would be an honest seat following the instrument that did it.  That is
# why the refusal has to land HERE, before the comparison, and not be folded into the verdict below.
