# Icon's `:=:` yields a VARIABLE, not a value, so a swap operand may itself be an assignment or another
# swap. SCRIP's Icon lowerer only recognises a plain name (or a subscript/section/field lvalue) there;
# anything else falls through to the by-name IR_SWAP path. Row
# icon-chained-swap-and-non-plain-swap-operands-abort-or-swap-the-wrong-values.

# ⛔ THE CLASS HAS TWO HALVES AND ONLY ONE OF THEM IS LOUD -- measured against iconx 2026-09-05 (hq_B):
#   x :=: y :=: z          SCRIP rc=134 FATAL "IR op=122 has no template" -- the guard sink inside the
#                          IR_SWAP case (emit.cpp), not a missing template; iconx prints 312
#   x :=: (y := 5)         SCRIP rc=0 prints 21 -- WRONG WHILE EXITING CLEANLY; iconx prints 51
#   (x := 7) :=: y         SCRIP rc=0 prints 21 -- WRONG WHILE EXITING CLEANLY; iconx prints 27
# The silent half is the reason this gate grades by VALUE: a compiles-or-not check, or a crash census,
# sees the chain and calls the class cured while the inner assignment's effect is still being dropped.
#
# Control arms, both already correct today, so a cure that breaks them is caught here and not on a board:
#   x :=: y                the plain two-name swap                     -> 21
#   L[1] :=: L[2]          the subscript lvalue path (IR_SWAP_VAR)     -> 21
#
# ⛔ REFUSES rc=2 unless all 12 runs (6 witnesses x 2 modes) are graded -- never skip-as-success.
