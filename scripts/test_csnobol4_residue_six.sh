# test_csnobol4_residue_six.sh -- verification for task `csnobol4-residue-six` (s191-era HQ measurement,
# re-classified 2026-09-04 by seat11; FINDING-2026-09-04-seat11-csnobol4-residue-six-reclassified.md).
#
# The original six: collect2 convert intval lexcmp nqueens setexit3. Fresh classification found FOUR now
# GREEN (collect2, intval, lexcmp, setexit3 -- the first was always a misread of a comment line, the other
# three were real defects since fixed as a side effect of unrelated SNOBOL4 work landing from other seats)
# and TWO still genuinely red, each already tracked by its own row: `convert` (table/CONVERT iteration
# order -- folded into icon-arizona-class-table-iteration-order-not-insertion, cross-language) and `nqueens`
# (SIGSEGV -- snobol4-csnobol4-nqueens-sigsegv). This script checks BOTH halves of that claim: the four
# named PASS cleanly, and the two reds are still linked from a real task file (so neither silently falls
# off everyone's radar if this row closes). It does NOT require convert/nqueens to be fixed -- curing them
# is out of this row's scope (class cure is hq_P's, per the sibling suite-census row's own convention).
