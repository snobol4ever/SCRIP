# WREG WIRE CENSUS -- the CORRECT instrument for "did the wires land?".
#
# ⛔ WHY THIS FILE EXISTS (s15b conviction, and it is the SECOND seat in a row):
#   s14 convicted the WREG claim gate for using `grep -c` (counts LINES) and printing the result
#   as `mentions` (occurrences).  s15 then measured wire emission with `grep -c 'lea r10'` against
#   emitter output that pads mnemonics with MULTIPLE SPACES (`lea              r10`).  That pattern
#   CANNOT MATCH.  It returned 0 on an arm that was emitting the wires correctly, and the 0 was
#   read as "the site glue never fired" -- producing two false claims that had to be retracted in
#   the same seat.  ONE INSTRUMENT FAMILY, TWO SEATS, SAME DEFECT: a grep whose UNITS were never
#   checked against its own input.  A zero from a grep is a CLAIM ABOUT TEXT and must be proven
#   like any other claim.  Hence: every pattern here is whitespace-tolerant (` +`) and word-
#   anchored (`\b`), and the script SELF-TESTS those patterns against a synthetic line before it
#   reports a single number.  If the self-test fails the script EXITS NONZERO and reports nothing,
#   because a silent zero is exactly the failure mode being prevented.

# ⭐ RE-POINTED 2026-08-30 (seat12, repo-wide dead-suite-path consumer sweep): corpus/probe/ was
# deleted wholesale (corpus-crosscheck-probe-total-conversion) -- this glob silently matched ZERO
# files against it (bash leaves an unmatched glob as a literal non-existent path with nullglob unset),
# so `for f in "$CORPUS"/*.sno` ran its body ZERO times, printing "TOTALS blobs=0 ... exits=0" and
# then "VERDICT: exits==blobs OK" -- 0==0 is a VACUOUS pass, not a real one, exactly the false-green
# shape this repo's own instrument laws exist to catch. Re-pointed to the flat tests/snobol4/ tree
# (real loose .sno files remain there); a hard population floor is added below since this script had
# none at all, unlike its ZDP-census siblings.
