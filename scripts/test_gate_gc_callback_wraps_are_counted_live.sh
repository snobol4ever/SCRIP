# test_gate_gc_callback_wraps_are_counted_live.sh -- THE CALLBACK WRAPS ARE COUNTED BY REACH, NOT BY SPELLING (row
# gc-the-forty-nine-callback-wrap-sites-carry-rt-gc-callback-and-the-count-is-live-not-static, the cfo, 2026-09-28; ceo CEO-1040:
# util_gc_acceptance.py's static wrap count cannot tell "every site wrapped" from "no site ever run", the defect retracted at CEO-1041).
#
# THE INSTRUMENT is scripts/util_gc_callback_reach.py: it runs programs under gdb with a silent breakpoint on rt_gc_cb_close and
# reads the file and line every RT_GC_CALLBACK close passes, so a site is REACHED only when a real callback through it returned --
# no runtime change, no getenv on the callback path, no new static.  This gate proves the instrument can see and cannot be fooled;
# the full census over the collector witnesses is the row's DONE-WHEN, not an arm here (it runs every witness under gdb).
#
# ARMS: (1) THE INSTRUMENT SEES: over hb_wsb_rk_iter_map.raku and hb_wsb_rk_iter_grep.raku the reader exits 0 with close events,
# reaches the array-call wrap in rt_call_arr_bl (named by FUNCTION, never by line), and reads UNLISTED 0 -- every event on a line
# the static list holds; (2) THE BLINDFOLD IS REFUSED: over a program that NEVER RUNS (a SNOBOL4 source that fails to parse, so zero
# closes by construction) the reader exits 2 with ZERO close events -- never "0 reached".  Measured while cutting this arm: a
# one-line SNOBOL4, Icon, Pascal or Raku program is NOT callback-free -- each closes 2 to 5 wraps at start-up through rt_call_arr_bl
# and rt_call_arr_bl_s (a one-line Prolog program closes none) -- so "a program with no callback" is not a safe fixture; (3) FAIL-ONCE: CB_REACH_PLANT_NO_PENDING=1 drops `set breakpoint pending on`, the breakpoint on a
# symbol of the not-yet-loaded runtime library then never exists, and arm (1)'s own population must REFUSE rc 2 -- the defect
# this reader had in its first cut, caught by its own refusal.
