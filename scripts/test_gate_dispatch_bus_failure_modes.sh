# test_gate_dispatch_bus_failure_modes.sh -- DONE-WHEN gate for fix-dispatch-bus-two-failure-modes (HQ s256).
#
# THE TWO FAILURE MODES FROM THE ORIGINAL BRIEF are each already fixed and each has its own dedicated
# negative-injection suite; this gate is the single canonical entry point that PROVES BOTH ARE STILL FIXED
# by composing those suites, then closes the one gap neither of them covers.
#   (1) identity depends on clone freshness, silent phantom-mailbox invention  -> test_gate_postoffice_identity.sh
#   (2) dispatch-by-inbox-alone (three sources of truth that could disagree)   -> test_gate_s4e_picker_v2.sh
#       (run here with --self-check too, so mode 2's own negative-injection proof runs as part of THIS gate)
#
# THE GAP THIS FILE ACTUALLY CLOSES: seat07's live report, q-s4e-msg-banner-attribution-undercount --
# next() and banner both resolved MULTIPLE of a seat's own claims by glob (alphabetical) file order, so a
# seat holding two open/assigned claims could be served, resumed, or attributed to the WRONG one. Cured by
# rank-sorting Pass 1/Pass 2 of next() the same way V2-1 already rank-sorts Pass 3 (free rows), and by
# having banner actually USE the topic done(topic) was already passing it (the call was `banner "$topic"
# ...` all along; banner just never read $2 for anything but the "-v" flag).
#
# ⛔ NEGATIVE-TESTED: --self-check re-runs every assertion below with the pre-fix (glob-order) answer
# injected in place of the real one -- same technique test_gate_s4e_picker_v2.sh already uses -- and
# requires itself to FAIL. A gate that cannot say NO is not a gate (seat16 measured 31/105 that cannot).

# ⛔⭐ THE ROW CELL, READ AS A CELL (hq_B 2026-09-13, row `instruments-the-stop-banner-wraps-twenty-six-
# of-its-forty-two-lines-past-eighty-columns`). These three checks used to substring-match "row <topic>"
# against the WHOLE banner, which worked only while the banner printed one long "· row <topic>" line. That
# line was 337 display columns and wrapped into five unreadable rows in Lon's terminal, so the verdict is now
# a fitted grid and the topic sits in its own labelled cell: "  row     OPEN <topic>".
# ⛔ WHAT IS BEING PRESERVED, EXACTLY: this gate's subject is ATTRIBUTION -- which row the banner picks --
# and that property is unchanged and still strictly asserted. Only the rendering it reads moved. The matcher
# is ANCHORED to the row line rather than loosened to a bare topic search: a bare *"<topic>"* would also
# match the topic appearing anywhere else in the banner, which would make all three checks pass for the
# wrong reason -- the weaker test is the trap here, not the stricter one. The SELF=1 injections below are
# rewritten into the same shape, so the fail-once proof still reds.
# ⛔⛔ ARMS C, D AND E ARE DELETED, NOT DISABLED (Lon 2026-09-13, in-chat to hq_S, verbatim: "See that banner
# you just output. The header says suite pass/tot gap date state. Delete whatever produced that. I want it
# gone. I've ordered that removed." then "I want the entire text gone. Not just the header.").  All three
# asserted that `banner` PRINTS a `row ...` cell attributing the seat to a topic, and the printed banner no
# longer exists: s4e_msg.sh banner emits nothing at all.  A gate over a deleted subject cannot be green, and
# rewriting them to read BOARD.md instead would be a DIFFERENT property than the one they were cut for.
# ⛔ WHAT IS NOT LOST: the rank-sort resume ORDER those arms rode on is still graded by A and B above, which
# read next() output rather than the banner.  Only the display assertion is gone.
