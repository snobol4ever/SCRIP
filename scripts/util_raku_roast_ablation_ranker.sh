# scripts/util_raku_roast_ablation_ranker.sh -- RANK A CURE BY ABLATION, NEVER BY FREQUENCY (hq_raku 2026-09-16,
# baton raku-every-roast-file-run-graded-against-rakudo-or-named-ungradable, TAKE NEXT item 1).
#
# ⛔⭐ THE INSTRUMENT THIS ROW LACKED, AND WHY THE ROW STALLED WITHOUT IT. raku_roast_scoreboard.sh --inventory
# prints ROAST_TOP_BLOCKING_CONSTRUCTS: a frequency histogram of the source line each file's parse died on.
# That list is A QUEUE, NOT A BOTTLENECK -- it ranks what each file hits FIRST, which is not what is BLOCKING
# it, and curing the head of the list merely advances those files to their next error. THE MEASUREMENT that
# settled it (hq_T 2026-09-14): the top entry headed 59 files; deleting that line from all 59 left 57 still
# parse-failing on ~40 different next constructs and moved EXACTLY ZERO into a graded bucket. The cure was
# fully defensible from the histogram and would have bought nothing.
# ⭐ SO THE ONLY HONEST UNLOCK METRIC IS ABLATION: remove the construct, re-run, and count FILES THAT MOVED.
# Frequency is where the queue is LONG; value is where the queue is SHORT BEHIND IT, and those are different
# lists. This script computes the second one. Frequency is used ONLY to nominate candidates -- never to rank
# them -- because you must start the ablation somewhere and the histogram is a free ordering of where files are.
#
# ⛔ IT WRITES NOTHING: no SCORE row, no RAKU-COVERAGE.md, no board. ONE RUNNER ONE BOARD is untouched
# (CEO-744) -- this publishes nothing and grades no published population, so it is admitted to any seat on
# the CEO-547 rule that a board is what it GRADES AND PUBLISHES.
# ⛔ IT REFUSES rc=2 RATHER THAN PRINTING THE SUCCESS SHAPE over a population it could not measure, and it
# PRINTS ITS DENOMINATOR on every line (CLAUDE.md § Testing).
#
# Usage: bash scripts/util_raku_roast_ablation_ranker.sh [--limit N] [--candidates K] [--section S03]
#   --limit N       census only the first N shipped .t files (bound the cost; default all)
#   --candidates K  ablate the K most frequent first-error constructs (default 8)
#   --section S     only files whose path starts with this prefix
#   --census-out F  ALSO write the per-file census (rel/bucket/line/construct) to F, tab separated.
#                   ⛔ THIS IS NOT PUBLISHING: F is a path the OPERATOR names, never a SCORE row, a
#                   leaderboard cell or RAKU-COVERAGE.md, and nothing reads it unless a human points at it.
#                   ⭐ IT EXISTS BECAUSE THE CENSUS WAS BEING THROWN AWAY: every follow-up question about
#                   the buckets ("which 3 files time out", "which 14 hit the emitter") cost a fresh ~9-minute
#                   full pass, so the cheap questions were priced like the expensive one and went unasked.
