# test_gate_mode_line2_is_self_consistent.sh -- MODE line 2 checked against ITSELF, with no second file.
#
# ⛔⭐ WHY THIS INSTRUMENT IS THE INVERSE OF EVERY OTHER LANE CHECK WE OWN, WHICH IS THE WHOLE POINT.
# Every lane instrument we had compares TWO readers -- the picker's table vs MODE line 2, a preflight parser
# vs MODE line 2, a seat's HQ file vs MODE line 2. All of them are blind BY CONSTRUCTION to line 2 being
# wrong about itself, because line 2 is the thing they all measure against. When CEO-723 rewrote the hq_S
# lane paragraph and missed two cross-references, line 2 said three things about Rebus at once:
#     "REBUS IS CLOSED ... so this seat carries Pascal and nothing else"   (the hq_S clause: DISCLAIMED)
#     "Rebus moves to hq_S."                                              (tail of the hq_T clause: ASSIGNED)
#     "... SNOCONE -- hq_I; REBUS -- hq_S; SNOBOL4 -- the cfo ..."        (THE SEATS list: ASSIGNED)
# test_gate_picker_lane_table_agrees_with_mode.sh printed rebus ✅ throughout. The agreement was REAL -- the
# table said hq_S and line 2 said hq_S -- and the fact underneath it was not. ⭐ THE GENERAL FORM, which is
# why this is a gate and not a one-off fix: a consistency check between A and B can never see B contradicting
# B. If a single document is the authority for N readers, SOMETHING has to grade the document alone, or its
# self-contradictions are invisible in exactly the proportion that we rely on it.
#
# ⛔ AND THE DAMAGE IS NOT PROPORTIONAL TO THE ERROR (cto -> hq_B, 2026-09-13). This is a census that names
# WORK ITEMS -- seats and languages -- not one that names numbers. A wrongly named owner is not ignored, it
# is ACTED ON: hq_I routed a Snocone co-sign to "hq_S (Rebus)" off exactly these words, and had hq_S signed,
# the Rebus arm of CEO-727 would carry a name and no owner, which reads as complete and is worse than blank.
# So this gate's cost is set by its WORST false positive, never by its rate, and every RED it prints names
# the exact substring and its byte offset in line 2 so the ceo can cure the LAW without re-deriving anything.
#
# WHAT IT CANNOT DO, STATED SO NOBODY READS MORE INTO A GREEN: it grades line 2 against line 2. A line that
# is uniformly, consistently WRONG about who owns a language is GREEN here, and correctly so -- that is what
# the two-reader gates are for. This one only ever answers "does the law agree with itself".
#
# Usage: bash scripts/test_gate_mode_line2_is_self_consistent.sh [--selftest] [--file <MODE-path>]
#   (no args)   parses the live MODE line 2; 0 self-consistent · 1 CONTRADICTION (named) · 2 cannot parse
#   --selftest  proves the scanner BOTH WAYS on fixtures before its live verdict means anything
#               (RULES.md INSTRUMENT LAWS #2). Exits 0 only if it REDS on every dirty fixture and PASSES
#               on every clean one.
#
# ⛔ rc=2 IS NOT A PASS. "I could not find any ownership claim in line 2" and "line 2 has no contradiction"
# are the same printed output from opposite causes -- the empty-grep trap (hq_S -> hq_B, 2026-09-13: the
# shape of the answer you wanted is also the shape of the instrument failing). The anti-vacuity floor below
# is what separates them: fewer than MODE_L2_MIN_LANGS languages carrying ANY claim is a REFUSAL, because a
# parser that has stopped matching agrees with everything it can no longer see.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------- the four claim shapes line 2 has actually used.
# Each yields (language, owner, shape, offset, evidence). `owner` is a seat token, or the pseudo-owner CLOSED.
# ⭐ Every shape is ANCHORED and adjacency-sensitive on purpose. "the SNOBOL4 runtime moves to the cfo" is a
# CONCERN moving, not a LANGUAGE LANE moving, and the one-word gap is the only thing that distinguishes them --
# so MOVES requires the language token immediately before "moves to". Widening that regex re-reads every
# concern hand-off as a lane reassignment and manufactures contradictions out of correct prose.
#
# ⛔⭐ AUTHORITATIVE vs MENTION -- THE DISTINCTION THIS GATE'S OWN SELFTEST FORCED ON IT, AND THE MOST
# IMPORTANT LINE IN THE FILE. The first draft treated every shape as an exclusive ownership claim and
# immediately reddened PROLOG on a perfectly correct line: NONET names "cto PROLOG, the ISO ladder",
# "hq_C PROLOG BREADTH" and "hq_R PROLOG BUILTINS AND STREAMS" -- three seats, one language, ZERO
# contradiction, because lanes are cut BY CONCERN and not only by language (Lon 2026-09-13). A roster clause
# says "this seat works on this language", which is not a claim to own it. Only THE SEATS list, an IS-CLOSED
# declaration and a MOVES-TO fragment claim the single completeness/ladder owner, so only those three can
# contradict each other. ⛔ Reddening on roster mentions would have made this gate loudest on the mode line's
# most deliberate feature -- a naming census whose worst false positive is "the ceo rewrites a correct lane
# cut to quiet an instrument", which is precisely the damage class that makes naming censuses expensive.
