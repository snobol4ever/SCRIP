# THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS TO KILL (seat16's audit, FINDING-2026-08-22-seat16-rung-gate-false-green-audit.md):
# 31 of 105 gates COULD NOT SAY NO.  Four distinct classes, one root cause -- a gate that examined NOTHING
# reported the same thing as a gate that examined everything and found it clean.  At 16 seats a gate that
# cannot fail closes rows on false green at scale, and ARCH-FLEET-CEO.md LAW 1 ("done is computed, never
# declared") is only as good as the gates a DONE-WHEN cites.
#
# THE THREE EXIT CODES.  This is the whole idea: "I checked and it is clean" and "I could not check" must
# never be the same exit code again.
#   0  CLEAN     -- work was actually examined, and it was good.
#   1  VIOLATION -- work was examined, and it was bad.
#   2  UNPROVEN  -- the gate could not examine the work (missing binary, empty corpus, absent path).
#                   ⛔ NOT a pass.  A fresh unbuilt seat gets 2, which is what SKIP-as-success was hiding.
#
# STRICTNESS IS NOW THE DEFAULT.  The old shape was "informational, exit 0, pass --strict to enforce" -- and
# `grep -rn -- --strict scripts/` proved NOTHING in the repo ever passed it.  A flag no caller passes is not
# an option, it is a disabled gate.  Callers wanting the old behaviour pass --informational explicitly, and
# it announces itself.

# ⭐⭐ THE TREE STAMP — ON EVERY ARM, INCLUDING UNPROVEN (hq_B + hq_C, 2026-08-29).
# ⛔ WHY IT IS NOT A TIMESTAMP: a verdict outlives the tree it measured, and then two honest readings of the
# same gate become an argument instead of a datum. hq_C's witness this session: one witness read stable at
# noon and 4/6 split that morning; without a stamp that is two people with different numbers, "resolved" by
# whoever measured last. WITH it, both readings are true and THE TREE MOVED — which is a finding, not a dispute.
# ⛔ SO IT STAMPS THE TREE, NOT THE CLOCK. Per repo, because SCRIP and corpus CAN disagree and a gate reads
# both. And -DIRTY is load-bearing: a bare HEAD hash on a dirty tree is WORSE than no hash, because it names a
# commit that does not describe what actually ran.
# ⛔ AND IT STAMPS UNPROVEN(2) TOO, not only PASS/FAIL. An UNPROVEN that cannot say which tree it failed to
# measure is the least actionable output a gate can produce — you cannot even tell whether a later build fixed it.
# ⭐ INSIDE THE HELPER, NEVER OPT-IN (hq_C's ruling, and the reason is decisive): an opt-in stamp is a stamp the
# next instrument forgets, and forgetting IS the failure mode. It also fails ASYMMETRICALLY — the gates that
# remember to opt in are the carefully-written ones, so the stamp would be present exactly where it was least
# needed and absent where it mattered most. No call site changes; all 17 callers inherit it.
# It must never break a gate: every git call is failure-tolerant and an unreadable repo prints `unknown`.

    # ⛔⭐ AND THE MACHINE, BECAUSE A TIMING-DEPENDENT VERDICT IS MACHINE-RELATIVE AS WELL AS TREE-RELATIVE.
    # ⚠️ READ THE PROVENANCE BEFORE CITING THIS. It was asked for by hq_C against fuzz-nondeterminism-rootcause,
    # where a witness appeared to flip rc 0 vs 124 with no code change. hq_C THEN RETRACTED THAT CASE ON THEIR
    # OWN MEASUREMENT and told me before I could build on it: a duration histogram (N=8, 20s ceiling, mode 3)
    # put fz_red_m1b at 0.02s x2 vs >=20.01s x6 and fz_segv_24 at 0.02s x4 vs >=20.01s x4 -- NOTHING near the
    # 8s boundary. A load-induced timeout clusters durations AROUND the boundary; those sit at 0.02s or run
    # past any ceiling offered. The hang is genuine and unbounded, and load was irrelevant to it.
    # ⭐ THE FEATURE STAYS, ON DIFFERENT AND INDEPENDENTLY MEASURED EVIDENCE -- not on the retracted case, and
    # this comment says so rather than quietly keeping the old justification. Measured here the same session:
    # test_corpus_snobol4.sh reported TIME TOTAL=487s where CLAUDE.md documents that board at ~28s, a 17x
    # spread on one box at load ~22/16 cores. A timeout tuned to the documented figure would SIGTERM a fully
    # green board and read as a hang. That is the real case, it is this file's own kind of instrument, and it
    # is why the stamp is worth its two lines.
    # ⛔ WHAT hq_C'S RETRACTION ACTUALLY PROVED IS SHARPER THAN THE ASK, AND IT IS NOT ABOUT LOAD: rc=124 is
    # byte-identical whether a program needs 8.1 seconds or forever, so the code has no capacity to
    # distinguish its two causes and every reader supplies the one they already believe -- six sessions read
    # a timeout code and inferred a hang, and were right by luck. ONLY A DURATION DISTRIBUTION SEPARATES THEM.
    # So the honest lesson is that an rc is not a measurement of time; if a verdict depends on duration,
    # RECORD THE DURATION. This stamp records the machine, which is the cheap half; the expensive half belongs
    # in whatever instrument is doing the timing.
    # ⭐ A NUMBER'S TREE IS PART OF ITS LABEL; FOR A TIMING-DEPENDENT NUMBER THE MACHINE STATE IS TOO, and
    # omitting it is the same omission wearing a clock. The ratio is what matters, so nproc is printed beside
    # the load rather than leaving the reader to guess the core count of a box they may never see.
