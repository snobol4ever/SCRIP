# THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS TO KILL (seat16's audit, FINDING-2026-08-22-seat16-rung-gate-false-green-audit.md):
# 31 of 105 gates COULD NOT SAY NO.  Four distinct classes, one root cause -- a gate that examined NOTHING
# reported the same thing as a gate that examined everything and found it clean.  At 16 seats a gate that
# cannot fail closes rows on false green at scale, and ARCH-FLEET-CEO.md LAW 1 ("done is computed, never
# declared") is only as good as the gates a DONE-WHEN cites.
#
# THE THREE EXIT CODES.  This is the whole idea: "I checked and it is clean" and "I could not check" must
# never be the same exit code again.
#   0  CLEAN     -- work was actually examined, and it was good.
#   1  VIOLATION -- work was examined, and it was bad.
#   2  UNPROVEN  -- the gate could not examine the work (missing binary, empty corpus, absent path).
#                   ⛔ NOT a pass.  A fresh unbuilt seat gets 2, which is what SKIP-as-success was hiding.
#
# STRICTNESS IS NOW THE DEFAULT.  The old shape was "informational, exit 0, pass --strict to enforce" -- and
# `grep -rn -- --strict scripts/` proved NOTHING in the repo ever passed it.  A flag no caller passes is not
# an option, it is a disabled gate.  Callers wanting the old behaviour pass --informational explicitly, and
# it announces itself.

# ⭐⭐ THE TREE STAMP — ON EVERY ARM, INCLUDING UNPROVEN (hq_B + hq_C, 2026-08-29).
# ⛔ WHY IT IS NOT A TIMESTAMP: a verdict outlives the tree it measured, and then two honest readings of the
# same gate become an argument instead of a datum. hq_C's witness this session: one witness read stable at
# noon and 4/6 split that morning; without a stamp that is two people with different numbers, "resolved" by
# whoever measured last. WITH it, both readings are true and THE TREE MOVED — which is a finding, not a dispute.
# ⛔ SO IT STAMPS THE TREE, NOT THE CLOCK. Per repo, because SCRIP and corpus CAN disagree and a gate reads
# both. And -DIRTY is load-bearing: a bare HEAD hash on a dirty tree is WORSE than no hash, because it names a
# commit that does not describe what actually ran.
# ⛔ AND IT STAMPS UNPROVEN(2) TOO, not only PASS/FAIL. An UNPROVEN that cannot say which tree it failed to
# measure is the least actionable output a gate can produce — you cannot even tell whether a later build fixed it.
# ⭐ INSIDE THE HELPER, NEVER OPT-IN (hq_C's ruling, and the reason is decisive): an opt-in stamp is a stamp the
# next instrument forgets, and forgetting IS the failure mode. It also fails ASYMMETRICALLY — the gates that
# remember to opt in are the carefully-written ones, so the stamp would be present exactly where it was least
# needed and absent where it mattered most. No call site changes; all 17 callers inherit it.
# It must never break a gate: every git call is failure-tolerant and an unreadable repo prints `unknown`.

    # ⛔⭐ AND THE MACHINE, BECAUSE A TIMING-DEPENDENT VERDICT IS MACHINE-RELATIVE AS WELL AS TREE-RELATIVE.
    # ⚠️ READ THE PROVENANCE BEFORE CITING THIS. It was asked for by hq_C against fuzz-nondeterminism-rootcause,
    # where a witness appeared to flip rc 0 vs 124 with no code change. hq_C THEN RETRACTED THAT CASE ON THEIR
    # OWN MEASUREMENT and told me before I could build on it: a duration histogram (N=8, 20s ceiling, mode 3)
    # put fz_red_m1b at 0.02s x2 vs >=20.01s x6 and fz_segv_24 at 0.02s x4 vs >=20.01s x4 -- NOTHING near the
    # 8s boundary. A load-induced timeout clusters durations AROUND the boundary; those sit at 0.02s or run
    # past any ceiling offered. The hang is genuine and unbounded, and load was irrelevant to it.
    # ⭐ THE FEATURE STAYS, ON DIFFERENT AND INDEPENDENTLY MEASURED EVIDENCE -- not on the retracted case, and
    # this comment says so rather than quietly keeping the old justification. Measured here the same session:
    # test_corpus_snobol4.sh reported TIME TOTAL=487s where CLAUDE.md documents that board at ~28s, a 17x
    # spread on one box at load ~22/16 cores. A timeout tuned to the documented figure would SIGTERM a fully
    # green board and read as a hang. That is the real case, it is this file's own kind of instrument, and it
    # is why the stamp is worth its two lines.
    # ⛔ WHAT hq_C'S RETRACTION ACTUALLY PROVED IS SHARPER THAN THE ASK, AND IT IS NOT ABOUT LOAD: rc=124 is
    # byte-identical whether a program needs 8.1 seconds or forever, so the code has no capacity to
    # distinguish its two causes and every reader supplies the one they already believe -- six sessions read
    # a timeout code and inferred a hang, and were right by luck. ONLY A DURATION DISTRIBUTION SEPARATES THEM.
    # So the honest lesson is that an rc is not a measurement of time; if a verdict depends on duration,
    # RECORD THE DURATION. This stamp records the machine, which is the cheap half; the expensive half belongs
    # in whatever instrument is doing the timing.
    # ⭐ A NUMBER'S TREE IS PART OF ITS LABEL; FOR A TIMING-DEPENDENT NUMBER THE MACHINE STATE IS TOO, and
    # omitting it is the same omission wearing a clock. The ratio is what matters, so nproc is printed beside
    # the load rather than leaving the reader to guess the core count of a box they may never see.

#
# THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS TO KILL (FINDING-2026-09-09-hq_P-a-completed-make-produced-a-binary-that-did-not-match-its-
# own-templates.md): a full `make` reported "Built: scrip" after compiling 198 objects and handed back a compiler that
# emitted code its own template sources do not describe -- three builds on one commit produced two different compilers.
# Every freshness check on the box PASSED throughout, and the only thing that exposed it was an unrelated source edit.
# Two SCORE rows were published from it.
#
# ⛔⭐ WHY THE MTIME GUARD CANNOT SEE THIS, WHICH IS STRUCTURAL AND NOT A BUG IN IT: the two artifacts it stamps are
# touched by the ACT OF RUNNING make, not by the build being right. `scrip`'s only prerequisite is the PHONY target
# `libscrip_rt`, so it is relinked on EVERY make; `out/libscrip_rt.so` carries a FORCE prerequisite, so its symlink is
# re-pointed on EVERY make; and $(RT_SO) itself relinks whenever ANY ONE of 269 objects changed. So a single stale
# object among 269 leaves all three artifacts newer than every source in the tree. The mtime guard is satisfied by
# make having RUN. It is structurally incapable of failing after a make that compiled anything at all.
#
# ⭐ WHAT THIS PROVES, STATED HONESTLY: it is a SELF-PIN, in exactly the sense CEO-395 draws for master refs and the
# port-trace standard draws for its two shapes. It proves the emitted code HAS NOT MOVED under a tree that HAS NOT
# MOVED. It proves nothing whatever about whether that code is RIGHT -- the oracle diffs do that. That narrow claim is
# the one the FINDING needed and could not get: hq_P's three builds sat on ONE commit, so the tree signature was
# constant across all three while the behaviour signature was not, and this fires on precisely that.
#
# THE LEDGER is out/build_behaviour.sig (gitignored, per-checkout, one line per observation:
# <tree-sig> <behaviour-sig> <so-md5> <iso8601> <seat>). A tree seen for the first time is RECORDED and passes -- there
# is no prior observation to contradict, and a probe that refused on first sight would refuse on every fresh clone.

# rather than in seven copies). THE MEASURED CASE: hq_S started an 1854-entry board and then ran an
# incremental build while it was still grading. The harness tried to exec the binary mid-relink, died with
# PermissionError, and refused -- WHICH IS THE ONLY REASON ANYONE NOTICED. A second either way and the board
# would have graded half its population on one binary and half on another AND PRINTED A COMPLETE, PLAUSIBLE
# TABLE. Every board that takes minutes has this hazard; the pre-existing board_stamp only compares ACROSS
# shards and only fingerprints scrip.
# ⛔ FINGERPRINT EVERY ARTIFACT THE RUN EXECUTES, AND THE .so IS THE ONE THAT MATTERS: ./scrip links the
# emitter and runtime DYNAMICALLY, so it is BYTE-IDENTICAL across the two arms of any emitter or runtime
# change -- a scrip-only check is vacuous exactly when it matters most. Measured on an emit.cpp A/B where two
# agents verified scrip's md5 as proof the binary had not moved, and the check was empty for the property in
# question. That is why this takes a LIST and the caller names the .so explicitly.
# ⭐ AND THE STRONGER MOVE, WHERE IT IS AFFORDABLE (hq_P): put the change behind a killswitch and run BOTH

# ⛔⭐ THE WITNESS IS THE coo's OWN, 2026-09-10 18:42 (COO-54): a board pass recorded corpus 4986354bb at start
# and a background job moved corpus to 2e8b94fe5 EIGHT SECONDS LATER. gate_bin_watch stayed silent and was
# RIGHT to -- the BINARY had not moved. That is the right question for it and the wrong one for this, and
# NOTHING IN THE FLEET ASKED THE OTHER ONE. A board whose corpus moves grades half its population against one
# corpus and half against another and prints a complete, plausible table -- the same shape hq_S measured for
# the binary on 2026-09-06, one repo over.
#
# ⛔ AND THE HALF THAT ALREADY EXISTED ONLY ANNOTATED. util_score_row.py reads S4E_TREE_AT_START and, when HEAD
# moved under the run, writes "graded; HEAD moved to <h> during the run" into the provenance -- an honest
# sentence attached to a number that describes no single tree. ⭐ AN ANNOTATION IS NOT A REFUSAL: the row is
# still published, still checkoutable, still quoted. Worse, only THREE runners ever set that variable, and the
# three Icon PACKAGE boards the one runner runs every hour set NONE of it -- so their rows stamped HEAD AT
# WRITE TIME, which is precisely the defect CEO-524 (1) was raised about, in its second form.
#
# SO THIS SETS THE VARIABLE *AND* REFUSES: gate_tree_watch exports S4E_TREE_AT_START in util_score_row's own
# vocabulary (`SCRIP=<h>,corpus=<h>`), so a caller gets the honest stamp by calling it, and gate_tree_unmoved
# refuses rc=2 before a number is published. ⛔ ONE SPELLING OF THAT STRING, HERE: it was hand-written in three
# runners and absent from the rest, which is how three of four boards came to be unstamped.
#
# ⭐ THE FINGERPRINT INCLUDES UNCOMMITTED STATE, deliberately: `<short-HEAD> <md5 of git status --porcelain>`.
# A ref edited and not committed moves the GRADED DATA without moving HEAD, and that is the likelier accident
# on a seat root than a commit is -- the coo edited corpus refs by hand four times on the day this was written.
# No false positives: a board READS SCRIP and corpus and writes neither. ⛔ .github IS NEVER WATCHED -- the
# board writes SCORE.md and SUITES.tsv itself, so watching it would make every board trip on its own row.

# is to grade its suite; if the leaderboard write fails (dirty .github, a renamed column, a read-only
# checkout) the MEASUREMENT is still valid and must still be printed.  Turning a bookkeeping failure
# into a red board would make runners stop calling this, which is how the duty dies.  So it WARNS

# --suite is what lets them coexist as two NAMED sub-measurements inside it.  This wrapper did not pass it,
# so a runner that used the wrapper OVERWROTE its neighbour's number, and the two runners that noticed had
# to bypass the wrapper to stay correct.  ⭐ A convenience wrapper that cannot express a distinction the
# underlying tool has does not simplify the call -- it silently narrows what the caller can say, and the

# THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS TO KILL: a consumer runs another gate/board, captures its output, and greps for

# `${x:-0}` that prints a false-clean board, an `${x:-UNPARSEABLE}` that reads a kill as a parse defect,
# or a hard `fail()` that reads a kill as a code regression. All three hand the reader a sentence about
# the CODE that is really a sentence about the MACHINE (a per-program timeout under fleet load, an outer
# kill, a crash) -- an instrument answering a narrower question than the reader thinks they asked, and
# never saying so. Witness: test_corpus_snobol4.sh KILLED 4 programs at its 120s bound under load 3.6 (a
# COULD-NOT-MEASURE, which that script itself already reports honestly, rc=2) and a consumer read the
# resulting absence as "FAIL m3=UNPARSEABLE" -- a sentence about zd_omega_head that was really a sentence
# about the box being busy.

#   rc==2   -- this codebase's OWN fixed vocabulary (see THE THREE EXIT CODES, top of this file) for "the

#              text happens to be sitting in $out -- a script that refuses can still have echoed partial
#              numbers before its refusal, and partial numbers are not a verdict.
#   rc==124 -- killed by an outer `timeout` wrapper. UNPROVEN: the sub-run never got to conclude.
#   rc>128  -- killed by a signal (rc-128). UNPROVEN, same reason.
#   else    -- the sub-run concluded under its own steam (ordinarily rc 0 or 1): look for

#              red is for the CALLER to judge from the line's own fields, exactly as before this helper
#              existed). NOT FOUND -> still UNPROVEN: a format change or a crash that produced no summary
#              is not evidence about the code under test either.
#
# On UNPROVEN it prints NOTHING to stdout (so a caller that forgets to check the return code gets an

# gate_file_has_fresh_guard <file> -- 0 the file calls the staleness preflight · 1 it demonstrably does not · 2 COULD NOT
# MEASURE. ⛔⭐ THREE-VALUED ON PURPOSE, AND THE THIRD VALUE IS THE POINT (hq_T 2026-09-09): this decides whether a census
# ACCUSES a named file of a violation, and an accusation sourced from a read that did not happen is a false RED -- the
# mirror of the false GREEN this whole family of gates exists to kill, and worse to meet, because the reader goes and
# edits a file that was never wrong.
# THE MEASURED CASE: ARM 15 of test_gate_runners_refuse_on_a_stale_binary.sh reported `uncovered=1
# test_gate_pl_gz6b.sh`, then on a re-run `uncovered=2 test_gate_capture_stdin_and_red_exit.sh
# test_gate_icn_port_trace.sh` -- THREE DIFFERENT FILES ACROSS TWO RUNS, every one of them carrying the shim call on its
# own LINE 1. Ten other runs of the identical loop over the identical 140 files reported uncovered=0.
# ⭐⭐ THE MECHANISM, PROVEN 2026-09-09 AFTER THIS COMMENT FIRST SAID IT WAS UNFOUND: SIGPIPE, turned into a verdict by
# `set -o pipefail`. `grep -q` exits the instant it matches -- and the guard call is the FIRST non-comment line in 93 of
# the 144 gates -- so the kernel tears down the read end while the upstream `grep -vE` may not yet have been scheduled to
# finish writing. That write returns EPIPE, the upstream dies 141, pipefail makes 141 the pipeline's status, and the
# function reports "no guard". MEASURED: the old body over 2712 calls at box load 21 produced 11 false negatives, EVERY
# ONE exit 141; this body over the same 2712 calls at the same load produced 0.
# ⛔⭐ AND THE FIRST ANALYSIS RULED SIGPIPE OUT, WRONGLY, WHICH IS THE MORE USEFUL HALF OF THIS COMMENT. The reasoning
# was: every candidate file is under 5KB stripped, far inside the 64KB pipe buffer, so the upstream can always complete
# its write. That is true and irrelevant -- THE BUFFER PREVENTS BLOCKING, NOT EPIPE. Whether the upstream finishes before
# the reader exits is a SCHEDULING race, not a capacity question, and it is a race only load can open: a tight 500-call
# loop on a quiet box reproduced it zero times, which is exactly what made the wrong conclusion feel measured.
# ⭐ THE LESSON, which outlives this function: an experiment that cannot reproduce a rare race is not evidence the race
# is absent, and "I measured it" is not the same claim as "I measured it under the conditions where it happens". The
# first analysis had the right instinct (the pipeline is the only structural difference from the sibling that never
# flaked) and then talked itself out of it with a capacity argument about a timing bug.
# THE COST OF THE DELAY, so nobody repeats it: THREE seats reported false work items from this -- hq_T's own ARM 15 runs,
# the coo's make-test report, and hq_R's, which the ceo turned into a ruling (CEO-462) directing a cure to
# test_gate_pl_gz5c.sh, a file that has carried the guard on line 3 since 2026-09-05. Four innocent files accused.
# gate_file_has_bin_watch_guard <file> -- 0 the file watches its artifacts for a MID-RUN swap and checks them
# before it publishes, 1 it does not, 2 unreadable.  ⛔ THE POPULATION RULE FOR ceo CEO-524 (1) LIVES HERE AND
# NOWHERE ELSE, for the same reason gate_file_has_fresh_guard does: a census that re-spells its own rule is a
# second copy, and the copy is what drifts.  THREE CONDITIONS, and the third is the one that matters -- the
# defect this grades is not a missing check, it is a check that fires AFTER the number is already on the page:
#   1  the file calls gate_bin_watch                      (a baseline was taken)
#   2  the file calls gate_bin_unmoved                    (the baseline is compared)
#   3  the FIRST gate_bin_unmoved precedes the FIRST line that publishes a count -- an echo of a *_BOARD line,
#      or a util_score_row.py / gate_score_row write.  A board with no such line publishes nothing and passes 3
#      vacuously, which is correct: there is nothing to be too late for.
# Comment lines are stripped before every read, so a file that merely NAMES the guard in prose does not pass.
# gate_file_has_tree_watch_guard <file> -- the SAME three conditions gate_file_has_bin_watch_guard grades,
# asked about the TREE pair instead of the artifact pair (coo 2026-09-10, COO-54).  ⛔ A SEPARATE FUNCTION AND
# NOT A PARAMETER, deliberately: the two guards answer different questions -- did the BINARY move, did the
# CORPUS move -- and a board can carry one and lack the other, which is exactly the state every board was in
# until this landed.  Folding them into one predicate would let a board pass by carrying either.
