# test_gate_swi_runner_keeps_what_a_killed_mode4_run_printed.sh -- test_prolog_swi_suite.sh grades a plunit file that hangs part-way the
# same in both modes: the cases it printed before the kill PASS in mode 3 AND mode 4, the case that hangs reads HANG in both.
#
# WHY (hq_prolog 2026-10-04, measured; the coo's cure): a mode-4 binary block-buffers stdout to the pipe, so a file killed at the runner's
# timeout lost EVERY case it had printed and read HANG throughout, while mode 3 writes as it goes -- core/test_acyclic read 41 m3-PASS and
# 0 m4-PASS for ONE hang present in both modes, and the coo's telegram called the 43 lost cases "mode 4 alone". The runner now runs the
# mode-4 binary under stdbuf -o0 -e0, as the harness runs every mode-4 binary.
#   K  a scratch swi_tests package of ONE file: test(a) succeeds, test(b) loops for ever. Want: a PASS m3, a PASS m4, b HANG m3, b HANG m4.
# Costs about two minutes: the runner's own 60 s timeout fires once per mode on test(b).
