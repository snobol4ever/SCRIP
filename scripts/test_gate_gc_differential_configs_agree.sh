# test_gate_gc_differential_configs_agree.sh -- row gc-the-differential-oracle-same-program-under-two-gc-
# configurations-must-agree (coo, 2026-09-21, MODE TENET; RULES.md THE INSTRUMENT LAWS; CEO-997 batch 30
# clause 2 -- a census NAMES and never only counts).
#
# THE PRINCIPLE. GC is SEMANTICALLY INVISIBLE, so one program on one input must print the same bytes under
# EVERY GC configuration. A divergence IS a defect with NO oracle and NO .ref required -- which makes every
# program in the corpus a GC test in all seven languages without anyone writing a witness, and that is what
# Lon asked for when he said he did not want things flushed out by hand.
#
# ⛔⭐ WHAT THIS GATE IS REALLY GUARDING, AND IT IS NOT THE PASS COUNT. A differential's pass condition is
# AGREEMENT, and the cheapest way to agree is to run one configuration N times. The hazard was measured
# before the instrument was written, on hb_bignum_length.icn at origin f7669a6a8 with SCRIP_ZETA_TELEM=1:
#     shipped 0 collections | SCRIP_GC_RELOC=1 0 | SCRIP_GC_POISON=0 0 | SCRIP_GC_PLANT_SHIFT=65536 0
#     SCRIP_HEAP_MB=1 1     | SCRIP_GC_STRESS=3 2598
# FOUR OF SIX DECLARED CONFIGURATIONS COLLECTED ZERO TIMES with byte-identical (empty) event fingerprints.
# A six-row md5 table over them prints six matching hashes and reads as "six configurations agree" while
# measuring one. RELOC, POISON and PLANT_SHIFT are MODIFIERS OF A COLLECTION, not independent axes. So every
# configuration is COMPOSED with a collecting axis, and -- because a declaration is not a measurement -- the
# harness re-proves distinctness PER PROGRAM from the collector's own printed events and refuses
# UNDISTINGUISHED rather than passing. The cto measured the same class from the other side the same afternoon
# (SCRIP_GC_PLANT_SHIFT=1048576 applying ZERO times, rc=0, byte-identical stdout; cured at SCRIP 1b317bea3).
# ⛔ hb_arr.sno is the standing proof that this is not hypothetical: 6 declared, 2 DISTINCT, five collapsed.
#
# ⛔ AND THE OPPOSITE ERROR IS ALSO AN ARM, because it discards real axes. arena1_nopoison has a move
# fingerprint IDENTICAL to arena1 -- poison changes what is written to VACATED ground, not what moves -- so a
# fingerprint built from the move columns calls a genuinely distinct configuration undistinguished. The
# fingerprint is taken over EVERY collector tag ([ZGC-POISON] is simply absent under POISON=0). Too narrow
# throws away axes; too wide (addresses, timings) makes every run of ONE configuration look distinct and the
# determinism pre-pass collapses. Arm 5 pins the stable direction, arm 3 the collapsing one.
#
# ⛔ WHY A DIVERGENCE IS rc=2 AND NOT rc=1 IN THE HARNESS. The question a caller asks it is "what does this
# program print?" If two GC configurations disagree there IS NO SINGLE ANSWER, so it refuses rather than hand
# a board whichever configuration it happened to run. The DEFECT is reported by NAME in the text and by this
# gate's ratchet; the rc reports measurability. THIS GATE reds on a NEW divergence -- see arm 1.
#
# ⛔ NO XFAIL AND NO SILENT FLOOR (CEO-753). The floor file records what was measured, and a program in it
# that DIVERGES is a RED here with its name, not a tolerated entry. The floor exists only so that a program
# which has been GRADED cannot quietly stop being graded -- a fall from AGREE to UNDISTINGUISHED or
# NO-COLLECTION is a knob that stopped taking, which is precisely this row's hazard, and it reds.
#
# ⛔ SPELLING IS HELD CONSTANT AND SAYING SO IS LOAD-BEARING (COO-127): the source path is itself a heap block,
# so its length shifts every block after it and one witness reaches interior=1 as scripts/x and interior=0 as
# ./scripts/x. Every configuration of one program is invoked with the IDENTICAL path string, so the
# differential is immune to that variable only because it never varies it. The cto measured that the same
# variable does NOT reach their static unmapped-store census (three spellings, calls=6326 on_grid=5295).
#
# ARMS. (1) the declared population is graded, the identity closes, and the RATCHET holds -- no new divergence
# and nothing that was graded has stopped being graded. (2) a PLANTED divergence is caught, naming both
# configurations and the first differing byte -- a differential that cannot report is not a differential.
# (3) a configuration that collapses onto another is UNDISTINGUISHED and NEVER a pass. (4) a program that
# differs from ITSELF is EXCLUDED and NAMED, never silently dropped. (5) the event fingerprint is STABLE
# across repeated runs of ONE configuration -- else every distinctness verdict is noise. (6) an empty or
# ungradable population REFUSES instead of reading as agreement. (7) telemetry does not change the answer, so
# holding it on across the matrix is not itself a variable.
# ⛔ This seat holds no cure lane (CEO-723): every divergence this instrument finds is a telegram to the
# owning seat and a row, never an edit here.
