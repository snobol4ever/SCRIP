# test_gate_icn_list_and_reads_size_argument_is_gated_like_iconx.sh -- cfo 2026-09-10,
# pinning the un-gated half of the cfo's 118fe2e4a (hq_C named the hole in mail the same evening).
#
# WHAT IT PINS. The SIZE argument of list(n) and reads(f,n) is gated by iconx before the builtin runs, and the
# two rejections are DIFFERENT ERRORS carrying the operand: a size that cannot convert to integer raises 101
# "integer expected or out of range" with the offending value, and a size that converts but is OUT OF RANGE
# raises 205 "invalid value" with the converted value. The ranges differ per builtin and that difference is the
# point: a list may be created with size 0 (n < 0 raises) while reads must be asked for at least one character
# (n < 1 raises), so reads(f,0) is a 205 where list(0) is a perfectly good empty list.
#
# ⛔ THE FALSE GREEN THIS GATE EXISTS TO REFUSE, and why every arm runs BEHIND A PRIMER. &errornumber,
# &errortext and &errorvalue all hold the PREVIOUS error's content. A build in which these gates were never
# wired does not report a wrong number -- the expression simply FAILS, silently, raising nothing at all, and the
# three keywords still read whatever the last error left there. So "the gate raised 101 with the value" and "the
# gate raised nothing and you are reading a corpse" render IDENTICALLY unless an unrelated error runs first.
# Every arm below is preceded by `&error := -1; (1 + "q")`, which raises 102 with the value "q" -- a number that
# answers NO case in this population and a value that matches no operand in it. An un-cured build therefore
# reads 102 on all five raising arms instead of 101/205, which is exactly what the control run measured.
# ⛔ The operands are deliberately "zz", -7, "ww", 0, -3 -- all distinct from the primer's "q" -- so that
# &errorvalue is graded against THIS expression's operand and cannot be satisfied by the primer's leftovers.
#
# ⛔ THE SIX ACCEPTING ARMS ARE THE CONTROL AND MUST STAY GREEN ON BOTH ARMS OF THE A/B. A size gate that
# rejects too eagerly greens the five raising arms and quietly breaks every legitimate call: a CONVERTIBLE
# STRING size is accepted (list("3") is a 3-element list, reads(f,"2") reads two characters), a real size is
# accepted and truncated (list(3.7) has 3 elements), list(0) and list() are empty lists, and reads(f) with no
# size at all reads one character. These read the primer's own 102 back out, which is the same instrument the
# raising arms use, pointed the other way: here 102 PROVES no error was raised.
#
# ⭐ WATCHED GO BOTH WAYS (CEO-381), MEASURED not assumed: with ONLY src/runtime/by_name_dispatch.c restored to
# its 118fe2e4a^ content and the runtime rebuilt, this gate reads rc=1 with 12 of the 22 arms diverging, and it
# is worth reading WHICH 12. The five raising arms x 2 modes all answer the primer's `n=102 v="q" t="numeric
# expected"` -- the corpse, not a wrong answer of their own, which is the whole reason the primer is there. The
# sixth pair is LIST_CVT, which goes <absent> in both modes: on the pre-cure build list("3") did not raise, it
# simply FAILED, so its write never ran. That is the accepting side proving it is not decoration -- the
# convertible-string size was broken too, in a different function (try_call_builtin_by_name_bl), and a gate
# carrying only the five raising arms would have pinned half a cure. The other ten arms stay green on BOTH arms
# of the A/B, which is what makes them controls. Cured tree: 22/22, rc=0, ~0.15s.
# Every want is cut from a FRESHLY BUILT icont/iconx at run time, never a stored .ref.
