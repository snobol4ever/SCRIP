#!/usr/bin/env bash
# test_gate_master_family_selector.sh — the executable DONE-WHEN for row
# `master-builder-delete-absorbed-family-selector` (ceo mint 2026-08-30).
#
# WHAT IT PROVES, and why each arm exists (hq_P's measurement at mint time): --delete-absorbed is
# all-or-nothing per LANGUAGE while FLEET-16 splits one language's consolidation across seats --
# icon has 208 verified-deletable families of which 153 are parser_* under a live seat lock, so the
# one authorized delete command would wipe another seat's working set and nobody could safely run
# it. `--family <prefix>` / `--only fam,fam` scope deletion to a named subset of the SAME-INVOCATION
# verified list.
#   A. POSITIVE, SCOPED — `--family <prefix>` deletes ONLY the matching subset; a verified family
#      outside the prefix survives on disk, untouched (not merely unverified — verified but out of
#      scope this run).
#   B. NEGATIVE — a prefix matching zero verified families REFUSES rc=2 and deletes nothing. A
#      typo'd prefix must never silently no-op while --delete-absorbed still exits 0.
#   C. UNCHANGED — plain `--delete-absorbed` with no selector still deletes every verified family,
#      byte-for-byte the same behaviour as before this row (checked against the SAME scratch
#      scenario A used, not a separate one, so A and C are directly comparable).
#   D. `--only fam,fam` (the exact-name alternative to a prefix) selects precisely the named set.
#
# ⛔ EVERY ARM RUNS ON A SCRATCH COPY, never the live master. Reads corpus/tests/snobol4 for its
# base tree shape only; writes exclusively under mktemp -d.
#
# Usage: bash scripts/test_gate_master_family_selector.sh [--informational]
