# hq_T 2026-09-12, ceo CEO-593, on Lon's CEO-579 (*"Do not count the FD as failures for us."*).
#
# ⛔⭐ WHAT THIS GRADES AND WHY IT IS NOT A DOCUMENTATION CHECK. `DEFERRED` is the one verdict on this project
# that MOVES PROGRAMS OUT OF THE BUCKET THAT CAN BE RED without anybody fixing them. OUTSIDE-BASELINE at least
# rests on a fact about the oracle that a reader can re-measure; DEFERRED rests on a SCHEDULING DECISION, and
# a scheduling decision decays into an abandonment in total silence -- the score stays lifted, the ruling stays
# quotable, and the work it was waiting on stops being anybody's.
# ⭐ A WRONG EXCLUSION COSTS MORE THAN A WRONG CURE, because a red stays visible and an excluded name cannot be
# red (hq_V, standing practice since 2026-09-10). This gate is that sentence made executable for DEFERRED.
#
# THE THREE CONDITIONS ARE ARCH-PROGRAM-LEDGER.md § DEFERRED's, and they are graded here one arm each:
#   ARM 3/4  A RULING NAMES IT -- CEO number, ISO date, and LON'S OWN WORDS IN QUOTES. No seat defers anything
#            on its own judgement, so a row whose verbatim does not name Lon is not a deferral at all.
#   ARM 7/8  IT IS PRINTED, NEVER SUBTRACTED IN SILENCE -- `deferred=N` is the sixth PACKAGE_INVENTORY term,
#            the names print beside it, and the identity closes WITH it and REFUSES WITHOUT it.
#   ARM 5    IT CARRIES THE WORK IT IS WAITING ON -- a measured size, and not a tautology.
# Plus the two arms nothing in the ledger could ask for because they are about drift, not about the ruling:
#   ARM 6    THE POPULATION IS RE-MEASURED AGAINST THE DISK. A count nobody re-asks is exactly the defect of
#            FINDING-2026-09-09-hq_T (an exclusion list with no staleness arm can only ever lower a
#            denominator): the record says 30, the tree ships 24, and six programs are lifted by a stale row.
#   ARM 9    THE BOARD SAYS DEFERRED, in the word DEFERRED. `◻ no runner` and `⏸ deferred` look alike in the
#            suite table and are opposite facts -- one is unscheduled debt, the other is debt scheduled out on
#            Lon's word. If the banner cannot tell them apart, the record exists and the board still lies.
#
# ⛔ REFUSES rc=2 (never green) when: DEFERRED.tsv is absent (the record this gate grades is gone -- that is
# not "nothing is deferred", it is "the instrument has no subject"), SUITES.tsv is absent, or bash/python is
# missing. ⭐ An EMPTY record (header only) is GREEN and says so: zero deferred populations is a legitimate
# state of the world and the only one that needs no ruling.
