# test_gate_gc_the_spine_cell_grid_is_anchored_at_the_region_base.sh -- THE LICENCE FOR A COLLECTOR THAT DOES NOT
# GUESS WHERE A SPINE CELL BEGINS (cto 2026-09-20; row gc-the-planner-gives-a-call-result-live-across-a-safe-
# point-a-mapped-slot-...; law RULES.md FACT RULE THE COLLECTOR GUESSES NOTHING, CEO-812; ARCH-GC section 2b Rule
# 1a and section 7 F1).
#
# WHAT IS BEING HELD HERE, IN ONE SENTENCE.  ARCH-GC says the collector "walks the spine from RSP to its base as an
# array of cells, reading tags: precise, path-independent, no map, no sniff, no guess".  gc_heap.c's gc_walk_words
# does not walk an array -- it steps EIGHT bytes at a time and tries gc_cell_visit at every step, so which words it
# reads as a descriptor depends on where the walk happened to land.  That walk is available to the collector as an
# ARRAY only if the emitter puts every cell start on one 16-byte grid anchored at the region base.  Whether it does
# is a property of EMITTED CODE, which is this seat's lane, and this gate is where it is measured rather than
# assumed.  MEASURED: 403 of 403 decidable SNOBOL4 call sites ON-GRID, 0 OFF-GRID.
#
# ⛔ WHAT A GREEN HERE DOES NOT SAY, WRITTEN FIRST SO NO READER TAKES IT FOR MORE.  It does not say the collector
# walks the grid -- it does not, today.  It does not say the spine is safe: a tag gc_cell_visit does not know is
# still a lost value (that is the DT_X ask, the cfo's file, CFO-141).  It says only that the emitted side supplies
# the anchor and the stride a grid walk would need, so the guessing in gc_walk_words is a CHOICE the collector can
# stop making, and not a necessity forced on it by the code the emitter produces.
#
# ⛔ AND THE ARTIFACT THAT THE FIRST READING OF THIS PROPERTY PRODUCED, kept here because the next reader will meet
# it again: the first grid pass read TWELVE off-grid sites at floor=-8, all in .Lclassspec/.Lclassnm labels.  They
# were not off the grid -- they were not the graph at all.  SNOBOL4 lays `module_init` immediately after main's
# last arm (`main_ω: mov edi,1 / call exit@PLT`), the CFG gives a `call` a fallthrough successor because a call
# returns, `exit` does not return, and main's rsp fixpoint walked into a different activation.  The census now
# drops the fallthrough edge into any label a `call` names.  A census that grades one frame's displacement against
# another frame's code reads defects that are not there, which is the same failure class as reading zero.

# ⛔ THE FRESHNESS GUARD, AND IT IS HERE BECAUSE THIS GATE'S OWN CLASS OF DEFECT REACHED THE GATES BUILT TO CHASE

# ⛔ THE RATCHET FLOOR, MOVED IN THE LANDING THAT EARNED IT (cto 2026-09-21, 5339 -> 6012).  Two cures in one
# landing, A/B'd against HEAD site by site in one process: 683 more call sites decided, 0 LOST, 0 DISAGREEMENTS
# over the 5339 sites both readings decide, off_grid 0 on BOTH sides.
#
# (1) THE FIXED-SYMBOL BASE FACT.  A store through a register loaded from a GOT slot -- `mov rax, qword ptr
# [rip + g_line@GOTPCREL]` then `mov qword ptr [rax + 0], 4` -- addresses a DEFINED SYMBOL, and no symbol is
# defined on a machine stack, so it cannot alias the spine and the anchor shadow survives it.  That is the same
# address-space fact slot_effect already places for a direct `[rip + sym]` store, reached through one
# indirection.  ⛔ AND THE ROAD THE PRIOR FLOOR'S OWN COMMENT PROPOSED WAS MEASURED EMPTY BEFORE IT WAS BUILT:
# it named a points-to fact about a NAMED ALLOCATOR'S RETURN, to be checked against the runtime.  Of the 2044
# unplaceable stores over these witnesses the base register is defined by a call ZERO times; it is a GOTPCREL
# load 1303 times and a rip-relative `lea` 284 times.  The allocator road would have been built and checked for
# nobody.  ⛔ The distinction is sound rather than convenient, and FOUR sites prove it: `lea r, [rsp + K]` puts
# a STACK address in a general register and is still feared, so a rule that placed every lea base would compute
# wrong depths at exactly those four while printing them as discoveries.
#
# (2) THE WIDENING NO LONGER THROWS AWAY THE ANSWER.  Going over DELTA_CAP used to collapse the whole state to
# BOTTOM, and BOTTOM is (rsp=None, rbp=None) -- so the cap destroyed the spine depth and the frame base to bound
# a set whose SHADOWS were what grew.  Enriching the shadows therefore bought grid sites while LOSING reach
# elsewhere: the fact alone took RBP-NOT-A-FRAME-BASE-HERE from 4 shielded stores to 116 across four Icon
# witnesses, a regression hiding underneath a 400-site improvement.  The widening now drops the shadows first
# and the values only if that is not enough, which is sound because a shadow can only ever turn an unknown rsp
# into a known one.  Reach restored to 4, and the grid floor went 5729 -> 6012 on top of it.
#
# ⛔⭐ ARM (b) STILL MEANS off_grid == 0, AND PAD-ALIGNED IS NOT AN AMNESTY.  Ten of the newly graded sites sit
# at floor=-8 residue=8 -- the fingerprint of the arithmetic slip that once announced 142 false OFF-GRID sites --
# so they were taken to the emitted text before anywhere else.  All ten are one shape in one graph: `sub rsp, 8`,
# stores to fixed symbols only, `call`, `add rsp, 8`.  The floor really is off the grid, so calling them ON-GRID
# would be a lie; the eight bytes are a bracketed System V pad with NOTHING STORED INTO THEM, so no descriptor
# cell lives there and calling them emitter defects would be a different lie.  The census names them PAD-ALIGNED
# with the three conditions checked, and arm (c)'s planted 8-byte PUSH still reads 30 OFF-GRID, which is what
# proves the pad verdict did not swallow the detector.
