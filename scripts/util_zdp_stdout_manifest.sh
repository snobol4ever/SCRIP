# one test per line, never a standalone program, and hashing an attempted whole-file compile of it
# would manifest a few hundred spurious "duplicate label" errors as if they were one file's byte
# identity. Same known limitation as census_zdp_sources.sh: the master's own ~1500+ entries are not
# walked by this manifest -- a follow-up, not solved here.
