# test_gate_pas_a_goto_never_enters_a_structured_statement.sh -- ISO 7185 6.8.1, refused at compile time
#
# MEASURED 2026-09-23 by hq_pascal on SCRIP 922c376ae, both modes, row pascal-all-test-suites-of-the-language-read-100-percent-on-the-
# suite-table-the-home-stretch (class row pascal-pat-goto-label-scope-validity). A goto may name label L only if the statement S that
# L prefixes contains the goto, or S is a statement of a statement-sequence containing the goto, or S is a statement of the outermost
# statement-sequence of an enclosing block. SCRIP checked none of it: PAT iso7185prt1832/1837/1845/1902/1903 jump INTO a for body,
# 1833 jumps from a procedure into a for body of main, and 1835 names a label that prefixes nothing -- all seven ran.
# ⭐ HOW: pascal_sem.c walks each procedure body once, carrying the path of structured statements (node, child) above each goto;
# statement-sequences (TT_PROGRAM, TT_SEQ_EXPR, a label's own TT_LABEL_DEF) add no step. The label's path must be a prefix of the
# goto's. A goto whose label is not in its own block searches the enclosing blocks (children precede parents in the procedure list),
# where the label must sit in the outermost sequence. The goto node now carries its source line, so the diagnostic names it.
# ⛔⭐ ONE DELIBERATE LENIENCY, NAMED SO NOBODY MISTAKES IT FOR CONFORMANCE: a goto from one branch of a structured statement into a
# labelled statement that is directly ANOTHER branch of that same statement (then -> else) is accepted. ISO forbids it -- an else-part
# is not a statement of a statement-sequence -- but Pascal-P4 does exactly that (insymbol's goto 3 in pcom.pas and p4/comp.pas), P4
# predates ISO 7185, fpc -Miso accepts it, and refusing it would break the P4 self-host. No PAT test exercises that shape, so both
# populations read full with it. Before landing, every acceptance program in the corpus was compiled with the check (PasM, the FPC
# suite, P4, P5, the benchmarks; 38 of them use goto): zero tripped; the only trips were the P5 copies of these same seven tests.
#
# ARMS: seven vendored PAT witnesses, each REFUSED with a non-empty diagnostic in BOTH modes (m4 compiles, and if the compile is
# accepted, links and runs). An eighth arm proves the check DISCRIMINATES: backward and forward gotos in one sequence, a goto out of a
# for body, the P4 then -> else shape, and a (compiled, not taken) non-local goto to main's outermost sequence run byte-identical to
# fpc -Miso in both modes. The non-local goto is NOT taken because SCRIP does not yet perform one (it falls through; row
# pascal-fpc-class-nonlocal-control-transfer) -- this gate grades the compile-time rule, not that. FAIL_ONCE=1 flips the first witness.
