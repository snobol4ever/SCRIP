# scripts/util_rtx_claims.sh -- THE RTX LEDGER GATE.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# .github/RTX-CLAIMS.md specifies this script and asserts it is run at session
# start and session close: "a hand-maintained ledger will rot ... so the ledger
# is checked by a script that derives truth from the tree, not from itself."
#
# ⛔ IT HAD NEVER BEEN WRITTEN. Measured s212-ICN: absent from scripts/, while
# three sessions' prose asserted it was the thing keeping the ledger honest.
# s209-SN4 recorded in the ledger's own message board that it "took the OUT:/FREE
# rows at face value ... that was luck, not verification." s212-ICN then refused
# to port rt_binop_overload purely on a hand-asserted allocation row. Both were
# correct BY LUCK. This closes that.
#
# The ledger is PROSE and stays prose -- humans read it. This script does not
# rewrite it; it recomputes the tree's truth and reports where the two disagree.
#
# THE FIVE ASSERTIONS (RTX-CLAIMS.md "THE GATE"):
#   1 DOUBLE-CLAIM     symbol OUT: to two ladders                    -> FATAL
#   2 PHANTOM-LEDGER   THREE diseases, reported apart (s216, was a single AND):
#                      no def + calls -> FATAL (the rt_frame class: unportable symbol)
#                      def + no calls -> WARN  (fails step 0(f): NOT-A-TARGET)
#                      neither        -> FATAL (ledger rot)
#   3 STALE-PORTED     row not DONE for a symbol already assembly    -> FATAL
#   4 UNLEDGERED-HOT   symbol above threshold, absent from ledger    -> warn
#   5 STALE-CHECKOUT   an OUT: older than 2 sessions                 -> warn
#
# EXIT: 0 = clean (warnings allowed), 1 = at least one FATAL.
#
# ⚠ SCOPE, STATED SO IT IS NOT OVERSOLD: this checks the ledger against the
# tree. It CANNOT check that a ladder honoured a claim it read, and it cannot
# see work in an unpushed clone -- the s202 ancestry check and handoff_status.sh
# remain separate obligations. It makes rot cheap to detect, not impossible.
