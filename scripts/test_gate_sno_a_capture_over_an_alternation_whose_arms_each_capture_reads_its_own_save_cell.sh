# test_gate_sno_a_capture_over_an_alternation_whose_arms_each_capture_reads_its_own_save_cell.sh -- a conditional capture whose captured span holds an alternation whose arms each hold a capture reads its OWN save cell, in both modes.
#
# # ⛔ THE DEFECT (row snobol4-a-capture-of-an-alternation-whose-arms-each-capture-then-a-deferred-call-target-reads-a-corrupt-capture-entry-in-both-modes, found by hq_snocone landing the Pascal Preprocess pattern).
#   ( ( '{$' BREAK('}') . B '}' | '(*$' BREAKX('*') . B '*)' ) . T . *F(B, T) ): the outer capture's save cell is a ζ-SPINE cell read by an rsp-relative offset counted along the main chain.
#   Each arm's capture pushes its own 16-byte save cell and keeps it until the arm backtracks, so on the path through an arm the outer COND read [rsp+16] one cell too high: it read an
#   uninitialised word (the low half of a saved stack pointer) as the capture's start, and rt_dcap_pump refused the entry as CORRUPT CAPTURE ENTRY and skipped the *F call.
#   frame_need_of homed a capture in the frame only when the alternation was the FIRST node of its span (cap_save_cond_gap_has_alt); a capture of a capture of the alternation was missed.
#   THE CURE: cap_save_cond_gap_has_alt walks the span along the main chain and homes the capture in the frame when it meets an alternation whose arms push a spine cell (alt_arms_push).
#
# THE ARMS (expectations cut from sbl -bf AT RUN TIME):
#   1-2  m3 / m4 WITNESS: the 8-line pattern over '{$def}' and '{$def}a(*$xyz*)', run 20 times each so the uninitialised word cannot be lucky   -- RED on base
#   3-4  m3 / m4 BARE SHAPE: the same chain over a bare alternation of two captured literals, no ARBNO or FENCE                      -- RED on base
#   5-6  CONTROL m3 / m4: the same pattern with no inner capture in the arms (captureless arms under the outer captures)
# EXIT: 0 all arms pass · 1 an arm failed · 2 REFUSED (no binary, no oracle, no tmpdir, the oracle's answer moved).
