# test_gate_gc_aggregate_interiors_are_marked_not_only_slotted.sh -- a LIVE array or record survives collection: rt_gc_visit_descr MARKS every block it walks into (the ARBLK and its data vector and proto, the DATINST and its type block and field vector), instead of only registering their slots (hq_V, GC-5 rung 2 groundwork, on Lon's "we do not allow pinning in our heap since we slide").
#
# MEASURED 2026-09-13 on 202d8bfff: `A = ARRAY(4); A<1> = 'alpha'` held in one variable across 60000 collections
# died with SIGSEGV in rt_gc_visit_descr (gc_heap.c:458, the DT_A element loop) reading a->data at 0x70001000 whose
# bytes had been reused as a string. Cause: the DT_A and DT_DATA arms of rt_gc_visit_descr called gc_slot_reg on
# &a->data, &u->fields and the aggregate handle but NEVER gc_mark_blk on the blocks themselves, so the vector a live
# array points at was swept while the array stayed reachable. Before CEO-661 rung 1 the four HB_WS/HB_WSS/HB_DINST/
# HB_ARR types were force-marked live at every regeneration, which hid the missing mark completely; rung 1 removed
# the force-mark and exposed it. This is the same class the ceo cured for the name-value table in rung 1 -- a root
# walk that VISITS without MARKING -- and every one of these blocks must be marked before it can be made to slide.
# ARMS: (1) SNOBOL4 ARRAY live across heavy collection, both modes, byte-identical to sbl -bf; (2) SNOBOL4 DATA
# record the same, both modes, byte-identical to sbl -bf; (3) an Icon record the same, mode 3, byte-identical to
# icont; (4) the instrument arm -- the witness must actually collect, so the gate REFUSES(2) if telemetry reports
# zero regenerations, because then it is measuring nothing.
# FAIL_ONCE cannot be an env knob here: SCRIP_GC_PIN_AGGREGATES=1 restores the immortal policy and therefore makes
# the witness PASS. The fail-once was proven by reverting the two rt_gc_visit_descr arms on this tree and rebuilding:
# arms 1 and 2 die with SIGSEGV. Recorded in FINDING-2026-09-13-hq_V-aggregate-interiors-visited-without-marking.md.
