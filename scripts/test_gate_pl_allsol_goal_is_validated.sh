# test_gate_pl_allsol_goal_is_validated.sh — findall/3, bagof/3 and setof/3 must CONVERT their Goal argument to a
# goal before they collect anything, and the conversion is what raises (row
# flip-inria-all-solutions-builtins-do-not-validate-their-goal-argument, hq_R 2026-09-06).
#
# WHAT THIS PINS. ISO/IEC 13211-1 § 8.10.1.3 / § 8.10.2.3 / § 8.10.3.3 give the all-solutions builtins the same two
# error conditions every meta-predicate carries, and § 7.6.2 says where they come from: the Goal argument is
# CONVERTED to a goal first, so an unbound goal is instantiation_error and a non-callable one is
# type_error(callable, Goal) — both raised before a single solution is collected. SCRIP did three different wrong
# things over six INRIA goals, and they share one cure surface in the lowerer:
#   (1) A NON-CALLABLE GOAL SUCCEEDED SILENTLY. findall(X,4,S), bagof(X,1,L) and setof(X,1,L) all wrote @OK, rc=0.
#       Nothing failed, nothing raised, and S/L came back bound — a plausible wrong answer, not a visible error.
#   (2) AN UNBOUND GOAL RAISED THE WRONG BALL. findall(X,Goal,S) raised type_error(callable,?/0): right that it is
#       an error, wrong about which, and the `?/0` culprit names nothing a program could inspect.
#   (3) A GOAL UNDER A CARET REFUSED TO COMPILE. bagof(X,Y^Z,L) and setof(X,X^(true;4),L) hit the rung-8 refusal
#       (rc=2, whole program does not build) — correct for a ^ goal we cannot yet GROUP, wrong for one ISO says
#       must THROW. The error needs no grouping, so the guard is now decided AHEAD of that refusal.
#
# ⛔⭐ THE ORDERING IS THE LOAD-BEARING PART, AND IT IS ALSO THE REGRESSION RISK. Moving the guard in front of the
# rung-8 refusal could have silently deleted the refusal for goals it legitimately covers, which would turn "this
# program does not compile" into "this program runs and quietly returns the wrong list" — the exact trade the
# refusal exists to prevent. ARM C is that control: a ^ goal with a REAL callable body must still refuse rc=2.
#
# ⛔ EVERY EXPECTATION IS ORACLE-CUT, from BOTH swipl 9.x and gprolog 1.4.5, measured 2026-09-06. The two agree on
# the ball's CLASS and its CULPRIT for all six; they differ only on the context argument (swipl
# context($bags:findall_loop/4,_) vs gprolog findall/3), which ISO leaves loose and this gate does not read.
# The ball is matched by UNIFICATION inside the witness program, never by comparing written text, so a
# write/1 formatting difference can never be mistaken for a semantic one.
#
# ✅⭐ THE NAMED GAP IS CLOSED AND ITS ARM IS NOW GRADED (hq_C `d4eefd1ac`, 2026-09-07). It stood here as a printed,
# uncounted row for one evening: a non-callable or unbound goal that only a RUNTIME binding puts in goal position —
# findall(X,(true,Y),S) with Y unbound — was still type_error(callable,?/0), because this cure inserts the guard on
# the goal's STATIC shape and the deeper runtime case is out of that insertion's reach. hq_C's meta-call re-drive
# resolves goals from slots at run time and therefore holds the real term at exactly the moment the lowerer cannot
# see it, so it calls rt_pl_dop_goal_guard_c on the RESOLVED goal — the same leaf, one caller further out. The row
# below is graded from here on, in both modes, like any other.
# ⛔ THE GAP WAS NOT MERELY AN ANONYMOUS CULPRIT, WHICH IS WHAT THIS FILE USED TO IMPLY. Measured by hq_C: the
# unbound case was raising a TYPE error where ISO § 7.6.2 says instantiation — a wrong CLASS wearing a right-looking
# shape, not a lazy argument on a correct error. ⭐ A placeholder culprit is a signal to re-check the error CLASS,
# not just the term: whoever wrote the placeholder was not distinguishing cases at that point either.
# ⛔ THE ARM WAS DELIBERATELY NOT PROMOTED UNTIL hq_C'S COMMIT WAS ON ORIGIN. This gate is in `make test`; promoting
# it an hour earlier would have reddened the blocking set for all nine seats in order to certify a cure that was not
# yet pushed. A gate must describe origin, never a colleague's intentions, however certain they are.
