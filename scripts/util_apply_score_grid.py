"""util_apply_score_grid.py <SCORE.md> <grid.txt> [--dry-run|--selftest]

MERGE util_build_score_md.py's stdout into SCORE.md's STANDARDIZED DISPLAY, cell by cell. It writes only the
columns the generator actually measures and leaves every other cell -- `Vendor / package suites`, and every
row's provenance -- exactly as it found them.

⛔⭐⭐ THIS SCRIPT USED TO SPLICE, AND A SPLICE IS A DELETION OF EVERYTHING IT DOES NOT REPLACE. It replaced
from the first `| Language |` header through the next `_tree: ..._` stamp, which fails in two independent
ways that compose into a file-destroying one:

  (1) BOUND BY POSITION, NOT SHAPE. SCORE.md carries TWO `| Language |` grids since ceo CEO-174 added the
      September-10 M/L/V/B grid ABOVE the standardized display. `s.index('\\n| Language |')` finds the
      SEPTEMBER-10 GRID -- not the display this script's own docstring named. Measured on the live file
      (hq_T 2026-09-04): the first header is line 57 (7 columns, the Sept-10 grid), the display is line 70
      (6 columns), and the stamp that ends the replacement is at line 81 -- so the "splice" spanned BOTH
      TABLES and would have collapsed them into one. This is precisely the position-over-shape defect that
      `util_score_row.py:find_table` was already cured of, in the sibling script, with the cure written up
      in its own comment -- and the lesson did not travel the six feet between the two files.

  (2) A NARROWER GRID SILENTLY DROPS COLUMNS. The generator emits a 4-column literal; the display is 6.

⛔⭐ THE OLD COLUMN-COUNT GUARD MADE (1) INVISIBLE BY ACCIDENTALLY MASKING IT. It compared 4 generated
columns against the FIRST header's 7 and refused -- so the script failed closed and nobody was hurt. But it
refused with a WRONG DIAGNOSIS ("the live board is 6 columns... those are Vendor and Tree"), naming a table
it was not looking at. Worse, its remedy told the reader to teach the generator the missing columns -- and
had anyone done so, the counts would have MATCHED at 7, the assert would have passed, and the splice would
have eaten both tables. A guard whose suggested fix disarms the guard is not a guard. ⭐ The general form:
a fail-closed check standing in front of a second, unrelated defect reports its own condition and conceals
the other one, and the concealment is strongest exactly when the check looks like it is working.

Merging removes the need for that guard entirely: a column this script cannot MAP BY NAME is never written,
so a narrow grid can no longer delete a wide one. Columns are matched by NAME against the display's own
header, never by index, so the two tables may grow columns independently.
