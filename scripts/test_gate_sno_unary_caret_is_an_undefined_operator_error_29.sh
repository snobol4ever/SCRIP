# THE DEFECT (the cto 2026-10-02, ceo CEO-1419 row snobol4-unary-caret-is-an-undefined-operator-error-29-where-scrip-passes-the-
# operand-or-exits, found by Lon's infinite_snobol4: about 34,000 differences): unary ^ is an undefined operator in SPITBOL,
# error 29 -- and it cannot be OPSYN'd (sbl: error 156). SCRIP ran it as a binary power with a null right operand: ^1 was 1,
# REM ^1 a PATTERN, 1.1 ^&INPUT the string 1.11, and 0 ^0 raised error 204, which the program died of.
# THE CAUSE: rt_call_arr_impl's one-argument arm (by_name_dispatch.c) raises 29 for the undefined unary operators / % # | ! =
# unless an OPSYN defined them, and ^ was missing from that list, so it fell through to the binary arm na(a, NULL, BINOP_POW).
# THE CURE: ^ joins the list, and sn4_unary_op_key gives it its own key (unary^), so a binary OPSYN of ^ can never answer for
# the unary operator.
#
# Each arm grades one line against sbl -bf cut AT RUN TIME, both modes. rc=0 clean · rc=1 a divergence · rc=2 REFUSAL.
