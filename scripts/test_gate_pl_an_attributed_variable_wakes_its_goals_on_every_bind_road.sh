# test_gate_pl_an_attributed_variable_wakes_its_goals_on_every_bind_road.sh -- an attributed variable bound on any road wakes its
# goals as swipl does, before the next goal and before an if-then-else commits: head unification of a constant, a structure and a
# repeated variable, =/2 inline and through call/1, a deep unification in either direction, a variable-variable binding in both
# orders and between two attributed variables, a binding made inside a C builtin (functor/3, arg/3, =../2, is/2, atom_length/2),
# memberchk/2 retrying past a woken goal's failure, a failed unification that wakes nothing, unifiable/3 that binds nothing, a woken
# goal that fails the binding, a ball thrown by a woken goal inside catch/3's run-time goal, copy_term/2 copying the attributes,
# freeze/2, frozen/2, dif/2, when/2, put_attr/3, get_attr/3, del_attr/2 and a user attr_unify_hook/2. Row prolog-swi-coroutining-
# and-attributed-variables-freeze-dif-when-put-attr-83-swi-cases (cto 2026-10-10); the design and its reviews are in the row's baton.
#
# THE WITNESS AND ITS REF, cut from swipl 9.0.4 with every variable name normalised to _ (the same sed runs on SCRIP's output):
# scripts/fixtures/hb_pl_attvar_wakes_on_every_bind_road.pl, 33 shapes, 48 lines.
# ARMS: (1) mode 3 and (2) mode 4 equal the ref; (3)-(6) mode 3 and mode 4 at a 64 KB window under SCRIP_GC_STRESS=1 and 3 with
# SCRIP_GC_CHAIN_CHECK=3, equal to the ref and reading bad-link 0, offchain-swept 0, mismatch 0 and missing 0 (the attributed
# variable's two-DESCR block, its attribute chain and the wake list are typed heap storage the collector moves under every road).
# (7) THE ZERO-COST ARM: a fixed program that names no attributed-variable predicate (the setup_call_cleanup fixture) emits no
# flag test (cmp against PL_ATTV_SLEN, 1448367169) and no $wakeup in its .s, while the witness's .s carries both (the control).
# FAIL_ONCE=1 grades against a ref with its first woke line removed, so every arm must red.
