# test_gate_icn_zk5_gva.sh — ZK-5 GATE: globals_on_stack=0 on the cells arm
# CHARTER: IR_VAR/IR_ASSIGN nodes with a global name must NEVER appear armed (zd_on=1)
# on the FORTH-spine ZD regime.  Globals are process-lifetime storage (GVA/NV), not
# control-flow-lifetime ζ; their stack-cell count must be 0 by construction.
# ONE AUTHORITY: the !_icn_cells conjunct in zd_wl_kind (emit.cpp) is the sole guard;
# this script is its falsification criterion per the ZK-0 FALSIFIABILITY rule.
# WITNESS: global_heavy.icn (three globals, one local binop) -- if any global leaks
# onto the spine the counter > 0 and grep finds it.
# COMPLETION: exit 0 = ZK-5 GVA assertion green.
#
# ⛔ DRIVER VARIABLE REPAIRED (s247, seat1, rung N-0).  Every check drove the witness with
# SCRIP_ICN_CELLS=1.  Z-1 (s230, db728001) made that variable A NO-OP: lower_icon.c reads SCRIP_ICN_CELLS
# ONLY when SCRIP_ICN_LEGACY=1 is also set, and otherwise stamps icn_cells_graph=1 unconditionally.  The
# gate was therefore driving the DEFAULT arm while believing it had selected the cells arm — true, but by
# accident, and it would have gone on printing PASS if the cells arm had been switched off entirely.  The
# checks now name the default arm, which IS the cells arm.  ⛔ Do not "restore" the variable: the arm it
# selected no longer exists as a separate configuration, and SCRIP_ICN_LEGACY=1 core-dumps on this very
# witness (measured s247) — the Z-1 killswitch does not restore a working configuration any more, which is
# recorded in GOAL-ICON-100 as evidence for the N-5 fold.
