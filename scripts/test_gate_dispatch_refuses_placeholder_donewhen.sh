# test_gate_dispatch_refuses_placeholder_donewhen.sh -- next/assign REFUSE to dispatch a row whose
# DONE-WHEN is still the mint placeholder, rather than serving it "unverified" like any other
# could-not-measure criterion. Row mint-dispatch-refuses-a-placeholder-done-when, ceo ruling CEO-286
# 2026-09-05, adopting hq_T's measurement: s4e_dispatch_probe already answers rc=2 "could not measure"
# for a placeholder DONE-WHEN -- correctly -- but both next's dispatch gate and assign's dispatch probe
# then SERVED the row anyway, indistinguishable from a slow criterion or a missing compiler. A row
# opened onto an unmeasurable criterion can never be CLOSED by any amount of correct work (`done`
# executes the DONE-WHEN line whole; prose is not a command), so the refusal a seat gets when trying to
# close it is indistinguishable from the one a genuinely wrong CURE produces. Two rows were opened onto
# exactly this shape on 2026-09-05 alone (the err-msgs row hq_P had to re-mint, and CEO-285's rank-0
# oracle row).
#
# FOUR ARMS, hermetic under a scratch postoffice per mktemp -- never the live one:
#   (1) NEXT-REFUSES     a rank-0 row with a placeholder DONE-WHEN is REFUSED (named in the message,
#                         baton path given), NOT claimed, its QUEUE column stays FREE, and the SAME
#                         `next` invocation goes on to serve the next candidate instead of stopping dead.
#   (2) NEXT-CONTROL     a substantive DONE-WHEN that outruns the dispatch-probe budget (a real,
#                         environmental could-not-measure, not a placeholder) is still SERVED (claimed)
#                         with the pre-existing "COULD NOT MEASURE" warning -- proving this cure does not
#                         widen into refusing every rc-2-shaped row, only the placeholder text itself.
#   (3) ASSIGN-REFUSES   an HQ assigning a placeholder row to a seat is REFUSED rc=2, no claim written.
#   (4) PROMOTION-REFUSES  the OTHER path a row reaches a seat through -- dependency-inversion promotion
#                         of a blocked row's blocker -- is refused too when the BLOCKER's own DONE-WHEN
#                         is a placeholder. The first draft of the sibling next-runs-done-when-at-dispatch
#                         cure wired only the ordinary path and no sibling gate noticed; this arm exists
#                         so the same half-wired shape cannot happen here unnoticed either.
# FAIL-ONCE: three mutants, one per insertion site -- M1 removes the ordinary PASS-3 check (arm 1 red),
# M2 removes assign's check (arm 3 red), M3 removes the promotion check (arm 4 red). EXIT 0 iff all arms
# hold on the real tool AND all three mutants go red; 1 otherwise; 2 REFUSED (fixture unbuildable).
