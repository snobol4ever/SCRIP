# GATE / DONE-WHEN for row snobol4-generator-exhaustive-expressions-graded-against-the-oracle
# (seat16, hq_T / GENERATORS lane, FLEET-20; task file at
# /home/resources/postoffice/tasks/snobol4-generator-exhaustive-expressions-graded-against-the-oracle.task.md).
#
# Runs util_generate_snobol4_exhaustive_expressions.py's rung 1 (length-1 and length-2 expressions, single
# '+' operator, population 110 by construction -- a number this gate states and checks, per the task's own
# requirement that the first rung's denominator be "checkable by hand"), grading every program against BOTH
# scrip and the shared correctness oracle (sbl_correctness_bin, ALWAYS -bf -- lib_oracle_flags.sh, the one
# authority; never a hand-rolled path).
#
# ⛔ REFUSES rc=2 on: missing python3/generator/scrip/oracle, a dead or -bf-incapable oracle (the generator's
# own capability probe), an empty (zero) population, or a rung-1 population that is not exactly the stated
# 110 (a silent change to the vocabulary without updating this gate's stated denominator is itself a defect
# this gate exists to catch -- "the shrunken-denominator law", corpus README / util_build_master_suite.py).
# ⛔ FAILS rc=1 on: any infra failure during grading (timeout/exec error on a nonzero population -- distinct
# from "could not measure at all"), or any real divergence between scrip and the oracle. A divergence is a
# genuine finding, routed to hq_P (SNOBOL4) per the task file, never swallowed here to keep the board green.
# PASSES rc=0 only when the full stated population graded clean with zero divergence.
