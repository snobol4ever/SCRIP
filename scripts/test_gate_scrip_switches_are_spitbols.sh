# test_gate_scrip_switches_are_spitbols.sh -- EVERY SPITBOL SWITCH SCRIP HONOURS BEHAVES AS sbl -bf DOES, AND EVERY ONE IT
# CANNOT HONOUR IS REFUSED WITH A STATED REASON, NEVER READ AS A FILE NAME AND NEVER ACCEPTED-AND-IGNORED (cto 2026-09-23,
# row spine-scrip-command-line-switches-are-spitbols-every-sbl-h-switch-with-spitbols-meaning; Lon in-chat to the ceo,
# verbatim: "Do make our SCRIP command-line switches just like SPITBOL."; CEO-1224, the three collisions ruled CEO-1227:
# "(1) Reject -F with stated reason. (2) keep our defaults for now. (3) reject for now.").
#
# THE ORACLE IS sbl -bf ITSELF, run beside scrip on the same witness for every behavioural switch: -n (compile, no
# execution, exit 231), -u "string" (HOST(0)), -r (INPUT reads the source after END), -b and -f (no signon, no folding),
# -T=file (TERMINAL to a file, the file compared byte for byte), -#=file (the channel pre-bound, INPUT(.v,#) opens it).
# Each pair must agree on stdout AND exit status. -F and -y are refused with the reason Lon named (non-zero exit, the
# word "case" / "save" in the message, never "cannot open"); -k and the listing family are refused with a reason; and
# no switch of sbl -h is read as a file name.
#
# NEGATIVE-TESTED IN EVERY RUN: an invented switch (-Q) must still be refused as an unknown argument by the driver's
# existing file-name path, so the gate can see the shape it forbids for real switches; and the -u arm plants a wrong
# expectation and must red on it.
