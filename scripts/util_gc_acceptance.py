"""util_gc_acceptance.py -- THE FOUR NUMBERS THE GC COMMITMENT IS MADE OF, computed, never typed.

Lon 2026-09-21, in-chat to the ceo, accepting the ceo's four definitions and ordering the display:
"Then we will commit to that. ... Can you display periodically the metrics which you are measuring
to state we made it 100%."  CEO-1039.  ARCH-GC-COMPILE-TIME-FRAME-MAPS.md section 11.

THE FOUR, each with a DENOMINATOR so the claim is falsifiable:
  1 INSTRUMENTED  every C->BB site hooked, every allocating call site polled, every callback wrapped.
  2 VISIBILITY    every event in the DECLARED event space observable and observed.
  3 AUDITED       every collection checked by the exact-vs-conservative differential pass, and its
                  SILENCE is the proof.  NOT 'every defect found' -- that is unprovable and the ceo
                  refused to promise it (the cfo's trap converts 2 of 17).
  4 WORKING       ZERO gradings lost to the collector across the arena and stress axes.  This is NOT
                  the master's absolute score: SnoM's 11 non-GC gaps are language completeness and
                  are frozen.  The target is that stress costs zero of them; today it costs 26+4 hangs.

INSTRUMENT LAW, held here rather than quoted: a metric that CANNOT BE MEASURED prints NOT-BUILT or
NOT-MEASURED and makes the verdict REFUSE(2).  It never prints 0 and never prints 100.  A display
that cannot tell 'clean' from 'never ran' is the thing this whole emergency is about.
