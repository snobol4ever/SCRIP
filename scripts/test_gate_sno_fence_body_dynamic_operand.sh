# SNOBOL4: a dynamic (variable) operand consumed INSIDE A FENCE BODY must earn a frame slot, exactly as one
# inside an ARBNO body does. FENCE(LEN(N) "-") "Q" against "ab-Q" MATCHES in SPITBOL; SCRIP printed NOMATCH
# in BOTH modes because xop_frame_member's gamma walk cannot reach a consumer inside a FENCE body -- IR_t
# carries only gamma and omega, so a body reachable only through a backtracking edge is never walked, and the
# allocator returned "not found" in the same spelling it uses for "not there". Cure: choice_body_member
# (src/emitter/emit.cpp) grants the slot when the consumer is POSITIVELY LOCATED inside an ARBNO *or* a
# FENCE0/FENCE1 extent -- a hazard proven, not guessed. Row snobol4-csnobol4-nqueens-sigsegv, FENCE half.
#
# ⛔⭐ WHY THIS GATE EXISTS AT ALL, and it is the reason the cure was nearly withdrawn instead of landed: the
# FENCE widening is INVISIBLE ON EVERY BOARD. Measured as a one-variable A/B on one tree (base origin/main
# 8691682f2 vs base+change), the SNOBOL4 master, the demo set, Icon, Prolog and Snocone are ALL BYTE-IDENTICAL
# between the arms -- same 1838/1839, same sole named red, same three stale XPASS, same 15 demo rows. A change
# with a zero delta on every board is indistinguishable from dead code UNTIL A WITNESS DEMANDS IT. These two
# witnesses are that demand: RED on clean main in both modes, GREEN with the change, emitted .s differing by 8
# lines. ⛔ Do not delete this gate because "the boards cover it". They measurably do not.
#
# ⭐ WITNESSES vs CONTROLS. The 2 WITNESSES were each PROVEN RED on clean main. The 2 CONTROLS are green on
# BOTH arms by design -- the ARBNO twin (already cured on main; it must not regress) and a static FENCE with no
# dynamic operand (the change must not disturb the case it does not target). Never prune a control for being
# green; that is the mirror of narrowing a gate to its loudest symptom.
#
# The oracle is RUN, never hardcoded, so this gate cannot drift from SPITBOL. sbl needs -bf (case-sensitive,
# matching SCRIP) and a writable listing sink or it dumps its listing to stdout.
# ⛔ REFUSES rc=2 unless every witness is graded in BOTH modes, and rc=2 if the oracle is missing -- a board
# without an oracle prints a full, plausible, entirely false table.
