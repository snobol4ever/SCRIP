# test_gate_pl_write_1_never_silently_drops_a_term_shape.sh -- write/1 MUST EMIT SOMETHING FOR EVERY TERM SHAPE,
# and for a BARE UNBOUND VARIABLE it must emit a variable name the way the oracle does (row
# prolog-logtalk-write-term-print-and-write-canonical-family, hq_R 2026-09-13; case lgt_write_term_3_065).
#
# THE DEFECT THIS PINS. `write(X)` with X a fresh variable printed ABSOLUTELY NOTHING -- not a wrong name, not a
# placeholder, an empty string -- while writeq/1, write_term/2 and print/1 on the same variable all printed _G0
# correctly. ⛔ THAT ASYMMETRY IS THE WHOLE REASON THIS WENT UNNOTICED: variables INSIDE a compound were always
# printed (f(_G0,_G0) and [a|_G0] were correct), so every test that wrote a term containing a variable passed. Only
# a variable at the TOP LEVEL, alone, vanished -- the narrowest possible window, and the one shape a conformance
# suite tests on purpose.
#
# THE CAUSE, worth naming because it is a family: dop_write (the $write det leaf) formatted its argument with
# out_write_descr, the GENERIC descriptor writer, rather than with the Prolog term writer that writeq/write_term/
# print all use. The generic writer has no notion of an unbound Prolog variable, so it emitted nothing for one. The
# cure routes ONLY the unbound case to rt_pl_write_cell_fp, which is why it cannot trade a passing case: it adds
# output exactly where there was none and touches no other shape.
#
# ⛔ EMPTY OUTPUT IS THE FAILURE MODE THIS GATE EXISTS FOR, SO NO ARM MAY TREAT EMPTY AS A PASS. Each shape is
# graded on its own line with a marker around it, so "wrote nothing" is distinguishable from "wrote the wrong
# thing" AND from "the program died before printing" -- three outcomes a bare diff collapses into one.
#
# ⛔ ONE KNOWN DIVERGENCE IS NAMED RATHER THAN EXCLUDED: write(-(1)) prints `- (1)` here and `- 1` in swipl. That is
# operator spacing, not a dropped shape, it predates this row, and it is NOT what this gate grades -- so it is
# listed below with want '- (1)' and a comment, instead of being quietly dropped from the population. A shape
# deleted from a gate because it disagrees is a measurement the gate has silently stopped making.
# rc 0 green · 1 red · 2 could not measure.
