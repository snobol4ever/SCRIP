# test_gate_fanout_ceiling.sh -- THE FAN-OUT CEILING IS HELD BY ITS INSTRUMENT (ceo CEO-1333, 2026-09-27 17:2x CDT; the cfo's row
# instruments-lib-fanout-a-seat-reads-the-load-before-fanning-out-...). MEASURED CAUSE: load 52.6 on 16 cores at 17:05 with three seats
# fanning out at once (14 + 13 children and a callgrind) and every other seat's proofs five times slower. THE RULE: a seat caps its
# concurrent children at max(2, min(4, cores - demand)) and runs a census serially under nice 19. WHAT THIS GATE HOLDS: (1) the helper
# exists and answers 2 at a planted load of 52 and min(4, cores - 1) at a planted load of 1, and 3 where cores - demand is 3 (FANOUT_TEST_LOAD plants the demand, CEO-1394); (2) the
# python mirror agrees with the shell helper at every planted load; (3) fanout_nice is the nice-19 prefix; (4) the live reading is a
# number in 2..4; (5) FAIL-ONCE: a planted helper without the min(4, ...) clamp reads cores - 1 at load 1 and this gate's own arm reds
# on it; (6) the fanning runners it was landed for still source the helper (a runner that stops reading the load is the defect this
# gate exists to catch). rc 2 when the helper is missing: a missing instrument is not a green.
