# test_gate_pl_ssu_rules_answer_as_swipl.sh -- SWI-PROLOG 9'S SINGLE-SIDED-UNIFICATION RULES (Head, Guard => Body) ANSWER AS
# SWIPL, IN BOTH MODES (cfo 2026-10-10, row prolog-swi-class-ssu-arrow-rules, re-owned to the cfo by CEO-1592; the ceo's
# ruling: "the parser recognizes the neck and the guard into the pruned parse tree as the grammar produces it, and the
# lowerer places the semantics").
#
# THE CURE.  The parser reads => as op(1200, xfx) and keeps the rule that fired, =>(Head or (Head, Guard), Body), as the
# DCG neck is kept.  prolog_lower.c keys the rule by its inner head and carries it as head arguments plus one goal
# =>(GuardProgram, BodyProgram).  lower_prolog.c's first pass, pl_ssu_rewrite, places the semantics: the head MATCHES the
# call by subsumption -- subsumes_term('$ssu'(Patterns), '$ssu'(Params)), so a caller's argument is never bound -- then
# '$ssu'(Patterns) = '$ssu'(Params) binds only the rule's own variables, then the guard, then the commit (a cut), then the
# body; a predicate whose last rule is SSU gains a last clause throwing existence_error(matching_rule, Goal), so a call no
# rule matches is an error while a rule that commits and then fails makes the call fail.  The prelude injector pulls
# subsumes_term/2 for a program (or a vendored library) that has an SSU rule.
#
# THE ARM: the row's DONE-WHEN witness -- a guarded rule (and its guard's own error on an unbound argument), a caller
# variable left unbound, commit then fail, and the no-match error -- cut against swipl -q in this run, variable names
# normalized, diffed in mode 3 and mode 4.  FAIL-ONCE, measured: on the parent (SCRIP 46e6f4cb7, where => is no operator)
# 12 of 12 lines missed in both modes; with pl_ssu_rewrite ablated (an SSU rule lowered as an ordinary clause) 12 of 12.
# rc=0 both modes agree with swipl · rc=1 a divergence · rc=2 REFUSAL (no swipl, no build).  ~3 s.
