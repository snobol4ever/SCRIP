# scripts/util_raku_parse_census.sh -- PARSE COVERAGE, MEASURED DIRECTLY, NEVER DERIVED (hq_raku 2026-09-16,
# cto's ask RE parse-coverage-taken-as-68-of-1464-and-the-census-must-be-a-script-on-origin).
#
# ⛔⭐⭐ WHY THIS SCRIPT EXISTS AND WHY IT IS A SCRIPT AND NOT A NUMBER IN A MESSAGE. Parse coverage was being
# DERIVED: take the roast inventory's buckets, subtract UNGRADED-PARSE from the shipped population, and call
# the remainder "files that parse". That is not a measurement and it read 143 when the truth was 66. THE
# REASON IS GENERAL AND IS THE CTO'S OWN RULING: a bucket named for a stage names WHAT IT COULD RECOGNISE,
# not what the program REACHED. UNGRADED-EMITTER, UNGRADED-CRASH and UNGRADED-NO-TAP are named for where the
# file died AFTER the parser had already been satisfied -- but UNGRADED-OTHER and UNGRADABLE-TIMEOUT are not,
# and a file can die before the parser for reasons that never print "parse error". So a number SUBTRACTED
# from buckets is never a measurement of the stage those buckets are not about.
# ⭐ THE CURE IS THE INSTRUMENT, NOT THE CORRECTION: a figure produced by hand can be produced wrongly by hand
# again next week, and the next reader cannot tell the two apart because both arrive as a number in a sentence.
# This walks the tree, asks the PARSER the parser's own question (--dump-ast, rc=0), prints the numerator over
# a PRINTED DENOMINATOR and NAMES EVERY FILE IT COUNTED -- so the next figure is reproducible and auditable
# by re-running one line, and a disagreement is a diff of two file lists rather than two opinions.
#
# ⛔ IT WRITES NOTHING: no SCORE row, no RAKU-COVERAGE.md, no board, no progress append. ONE RUNNER ONE BOARD
# (CEO-775) is untouched -- a board is what it GRADES AND PUBLISHES (CEO-547), and this publishes nothing --
# so it is admitted to any seat and carries no one_runner_guard.
# ⛔ IT REFUSES rc=2 rather than printing the success shape over a population it could not measure, and it
# asserts its own identity (parsed + parse_fail + other == total) rather than assuming it.
#
# Usage: bash scripts/util_raku_parse_census.sh [--summary] [--limit N] [--section S03] [--out FILE]
#   --summary   print the headline line only -- no file list (for a caller embedding the row in a board)
#   --limit N   census only the first N files (smoke the instrument; the headline says PARTIAL)
#   --section S only files whose roast-relative path starts with this prefix
#   --out FILE  ALSO write the per-file census (rel/verdict/err_line/construct) to FILE, tab separated.
#               ⛔ NOT PUBLISHING: FILE is a path the OPERATOR names, never a SCORE cell.
