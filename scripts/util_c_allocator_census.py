"""util_c_allocator_census.py -- THE CENSUS THAT PROVES ZERO, AND SAYS WHERE EACH SITE WENT (coo, CEO-842/843).

LON'S ACCEPTANCE TEST IS TEXTUAL AND IT IS HIS (2026-09-18, in-chat to ceo, verbatim: "Eradicate ALL usage of
malloc, calloc, free, and realloc.  At the end ensure 0 instances found in the SCRIP source base."), so half of
this tool is a count of four names that must reach 0 over the WHOLE tree -- src/parsers and the checked-in
generated flex/bison output included, because a generated file that is committed is source.

⛔⭐ THE OTHER HALF IS THE ceo's OWN WARNING AND IT IS WHY THIS IS NOT A grep (CEO-843, verbatim): "a census that
only counts the four names would read green on a tree where half the runtime quietly lives outside the
collector."  The rule names THREE destinations and only one of them is right for a given site:

  ROOTED-HEAP   rt_ws_alloc / rt_ws_alloc_descr / rt_ws_realloc -- anything the RUNNING PROGRAM can reach, walked like everything
                else, with a root.  If you are unsure, this is the answer (CEO-842).
  ARENA         ct_alloc / ct_zalloc / ct_grow / ct_strdup / ct_strndup / ct_drop -- anything only the COMPILER
                touches, dead before the emitted program runs.
  MMAP          the collector's OWN bookkeeping (page map, mark worklist, live-block array) reserves address
                space directly.  mmap is not one of the four names and a region whose lifetime rule is stated is
                the opposite of handing an object to an allocator the collector cannot see.

⛔ THE ANTI-EVASION CLAUSE IS THE POPULATION THIS TOOL EXISTS FOR: THE ARENA MAY NOT HOLD ANYTHING THE RUNTIME
CAN REACH -- that is the same evasion as malloc or a pin, one name further out, reverted on sight.  So an ARENA
call site under src/runtime/ is counted as a VIOLATION and named, with gc_heap.c's own bookkeeping the one place
MMAP is expected.  A tree can satisfy Lon's grep exactly while failing this, which is the whole point.

⛔ IT COUNTS CALLS, NOT WORDS.  Comments and string literals are stripped, a declaration or prototype is not a
call, and `ct_free` / `rt_ws_realloc` are not `free` / `realloc` -- the word-boundary does that, and an arm plants
it.  Evasions the rule names by hand are counted too: `#define X malloc`, a typedef'd pointer assigned one of the
four, and a wrapper whose body calls one.

⛔ IT REFUSES RATHER THAN PASSING VACUOUSLY.  No source tree, no readable file, or a tree where the four names
read 0 AND no destination symbol appears anywhere -- which would mean nothing in this compiler allocates at all
-- is rc=2, NOT GREEN.  A zero from a tool that read nothing is not a zero.

rc: 0 forbidden=0 and no arena-in-runtime violation; 1 either remains; 2 could not measure.

      CLASS 1 -- a site that was on the COLLECTED HEAP and is now in the ARENA.  That is moving an object out
        of the collector's sight to avoid rooting it: the cfo's f62a33aed shape under a new name.  HARD RED,

    collected heap into the arena and it is class 1 -- whatever the intervening edits were.  The rest of the
    arena growth is attributed to the forbidden calls the same file lost, which is class 2.  A file that both
    roots a new holder and arenas an old malloc in one landing is reported at its NET, and a class-1 site
