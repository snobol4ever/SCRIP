# test_demos_suite.sh <lang> [--no-write] -- THE DEMO SUITE ROW: every demo is a test AND a workhorse benchmark (Lon 2026-09-27, in-chat to
# the ceo, verbatim: "ALso remember that all demos are also benchmarks. They are work-horse benchmarks." and "So demos are test suites in
# that they have a small input (a sample of the larger work horse input) and a ref file. All demos are benchmarks since they can be run at
# wall clock and perf values extracted. They are not run in loops."; ceo CEO-1312/1313; coo COO-206).
# THE TEST ROLE, graded here: every program under corpus/demos/<lang> (the DONE-WHEN's own census: *.sno *.icn *.pl *.sc *.pas *.raku
# *.reb *.scrip, three levels deep) that its CONTAINERS.tsv does not declare a container or library block is run on its SAMPLE input --
# stdin from <stem>.in (else <stem>.input), arguments from its <stem>.cmdline run_args (or an Icon <stem>.argv), its heap, stack and
# compile_args from its sidecars (RULES.md clause 8 (f): the runner types none of its own) -- in mode 3 and in mode 4, in a scratch copy
# of its directory with SNO_LIB its own directory then corpus/include (the scorecard's SELFDIR:include), and its stdout is compared byte for byte with <stem>.ref, cut from the language's oracle. A program with no ref
# grades FAIL, counted and named, never skipped. The row is <lang>-demos: both_modes_pass over the programs, written through
# util_score_row.py --column demos by the language's LANES seat (CEO-1232), with a progress row per program and mode (class benchmark,
# suite <lang>-demos). THE BENCHMARK ROLE is the <stem>.workhorse sidecar (lib_declared_arena.sh declared_workhorse_beside): the full input,
# run once at wall clock by the timing instruments, never here and never in a loop; this runner only counts the declarations.
# EXIT: 0 every graded program passes both modes; 1 a red named; 2 could not measure.
