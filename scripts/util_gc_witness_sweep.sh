# util_gc_witness_sweep.sh -- THE SECONDS-SCALE DETECTOR for a safe-point conversion batch (ceo CEO-1109,
# row gc-a-fast-witness-detector-grades-a-safe-point-conversion-batch-in-seconds-proven-against-the-known-bad-insertion).
#
# ⛔ WHY THIS EXISTS, AND THE NUMBER IS THE REASON.  On 2026-09-22 the ceo inserted 77 safe-point polls chosen by
# the callee's DECLARED RETURN CLASS -- VOID or a narrow scalar means nothing wide enough to be a pointer comes
# back in rax -- and the census read 133 -> 210 of 253.  ALL EIGHT PER-LANGUAGE SMOKES PASSED on 26 of them, and
# those 26 still cost 57 Icon programs when the Icon master ran: 823/826 m3 on a clean tree against 766/826 with
# the batch, plus a new hang.  The return class says what the CALLEE RETURNS and NOTHING about what is ALREADY
# LIVE in a register at that point -- the scan templates hold the Σ pair in r13/r15d, bb_to/bb_to_by hold the
# generator's state -- so a register-preserving poll hands those back STALE once the block moves.
# ⛔ THE SMOKE ARM IS NOT A DETECTOR FOR A COLLECTOR CHANGE.  The master is, and it costs five minutes a pass,
# which is too slow to iterate a hundred-site conversion against.  This sweep is the instrument in between.
#
# HOW IT GETS ITS TEETH, and neither half is optional:
#   SCRIP_GC_RELOC=1  every live block relocates on EVERY collection, so a surviving reference to an old address
#                     is wrong IMMEDIATELY rather than eventually.  Measured at 3e1b04476: 84.7% of live-block
#                     forwardings normally leave the block exactly where it was, which is why a lost root so
#                     often prints a plausible answer -- stale in principle and, five times in six, valid in fact.
#   SCRIP_GC_TRAP     (default ON) PROT_NONEs the vacated ground, so reading a stale pointer FAULTS instead of
#                     quietly returning whatever the arena re-issued.
#   a tiny arena      SCRIP_HEAP_KB=128, the shipped default since CEO-1095 and the peak of exasperation.
#   SCRIP_GC_STRESS   a band, because one point is a configuration and not an exercise.
#
# ⛔ THIS SWEEP IS NOT A BOARD AND NEVER REWRITES A SCORE ROW.  It grades the GC witness set, not a denominator
# anyone ships.  A green here licenses the NEXT step of a conversion, never a landing: the landing verdict is
# still the row's DONE-WHEN plus the cure's own language MASTER with a clean-tree control arm (CEO-1107).
