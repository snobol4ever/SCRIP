#
# Invariant: the old shim-macro names — `g_registry`, `label_table`,
# `label_count`, `g_pl_pred_table`, `proc_table`, `proc_count` — must
# appear in source ONLY as qualified field references of stage2_t, never
# as bare/unqualified identifiers.
#
# ST2-1 introduced stage2_t with those six fields and a corresponding set
# of reader shim macros (`#define proc_table (g_stage2.proc_table)` etc.).
# ST2-1b deleted all six macros across four sub-steps (g_registry,
# label_table/label_count, g_pl_pred_table, proc_table/proc_count).  Today
# every reader of those tables resolves to either:
#
#     g_stage2.<field>     (deep-dispatch sites with no s2 in scope)
#     s2-><field>          (producer sites threading stage2_t *s2)
#
# A bare `proc_table[i]` or `proc_count++` in a future commit would mean
# someone reintroduced a shim macro (or relied on one that's been deleted).
# Both are regressions of the ST2-1b decision.  This gate catches that
# regression at grep time, before the slower compile/link/test cycle.
#
# Honest scope: this is a TOKEN firewall (same shape as the parse/runtime
# include firewalls — fast, lexical, false-positive-prone).  It does NOT
# prove that reads of g_stage2 fields are reachable only from the proper
# producer/reader sites.  A link-time isolation analogous to ISO-7 would
# close that gap; see ST2-2's followup in the goal file.
