# THEY TRIP, AND THE COUNTS ONLY FALL (coo 2026-09-17; row gc-instruments-the-safe-point-census-the-maps-census-and-

#
# WHAT THIS GATE IS FOR.  The five censuses are RED today and stay red until the design lands -- that is the point of
# them, and it is exactly why they cannot grade themselves.  A census that reports success while counting nothing is
# THE recurring failure (RULES.md THE INSTRUMENT LAWS), so this gate grades the INSTRUMENTS, not the collector:
#   (a) every census trips on a PLANTED violation and passes a clean fixture -- util_gc_census.py --selftest, 39 arms COUNTED as they run (the arm asserts >= 25; the tool itself refuses below its own floor)
#   (b) all six censuses run on THIS tree and each prints its population and a verdict; none is silent, none crashes
#   (c) THE RATCHET: every count is exactly its baseline (scripts/gc_census_baseline.tsv).  UP is a regression; DOWN
#       with the baseline unchanged is a win nobody recorded, and a loose ratchet lets the next regression back in --
#       the landing that earns the fall runs `util_gc_census.py all --write-baseline scripts/gc_census_baseline.tsv`
#   (d) the maps census reports its TWO HALVES separately (slot-kind over the languages' masters; the section 6.4 table
#       from three independent producers) -- a green slot-kind half folded over an absent table would read as if the
#       design existed -- and a partial language sweep NAMES itself as partial rather than reading as coverage
#   (e) hq_snocone's DECIDABLE TEST runs, and its verdict is consistent with the conservative census: "the collector
#       finds the roots" (rc=0) is admissible only when the word walker is gone (conservative count 0).  A green
#       decidable test beside a live word walker would mean the instrument is lying, and that is a RED here.
# FAIL_ONCE=1 blanks the selftest's proof line before arm (a) asserts, to prove the arm trips.
