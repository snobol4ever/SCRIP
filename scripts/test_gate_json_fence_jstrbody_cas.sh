# corpus/demos/snobol4/json/{json.sno,json-match-fence.sno}), graded on its own real DONE-WHEN target:
# the full 1.7MB corpus/demos/snobol4/json/citm_catalog.json, both files, both modes, byte-identical to the
# correctness oracle (sbl_correctness_bin, -bf per lib_oracle_flags.sh -- the s189 authority, never -b alone).
# Refs minted this session from a clean oracle run (rc=0, ~0.2s wall, match_ms=240 -- FENCE keeps this cheap;
# maxdepth=8 matches hq_P's independent citm measurement in FINDING-2026-08-23-hq_P-fence0-blob-floor-...).
# Item 2 (relocating jobject/jarray's FENCE from definition-site to use-site) is NOT exercised here and never
# will be by this gate: seat04 (FINDING-2026-08-22-seat04-json-alternate-af-spin-root-cause-flat-choice-record-
# rsp-drift.md §7b) proved it trades the af-spin hang for a SIGSEGV on recursive boxes via blob_choice_rbp_scan
# eligibility -- a receipted refusal, not an oversight; see FINDING-2026-08-29-seat10-fence-jstrbody-cas-citm-

# ⛔ EACH WORKLOAD RUNS AT THE STACK AND HEAP IT DECLARES (clause 8 (f); the coo 2026-10-01, the ceo's yes to the instrument row): the
# unit is a program ON AN INPUT, so its .heap/.stack sidecars sit beside its ref under the ref's stem and are read by the one reader,
# declared_switches_beside. MEASURED at SCRIP 4cfd7e0f4, two readings each: json-match-fence.sno on citm_catalog.json overflows (ERROR
# 246) at -s8192k, -s16384k and -s32768k and matches the ref at -s65536k; sbl -bf overflows at its default and matches from -s16384k.
# The gate ran every arm at the runtime's defaults until this, so the two match-fence arms read FAIL on a stack, not on FENCE.
# json.sno on the same input matches at the defaults and declares nothing.
