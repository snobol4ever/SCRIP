# lib_donewhen.sh -- THE ONE AUTHORITY for "what is the first COMMAND WORD of a DONE-WHEN".
# hq_T 2026-09-11, on hq_S's measured false positive. Sourced by test_gate_baton_donewhen_runnable.sh and by
# s4e_msg.sh (mint and done). ⛔ FOUR COPIES OF THE OLD ONE-LINER EXISTED -- gate:108, gate:139, s4e_msg:810,
# s4e_msg:1675 -- all with the same defect, so a row refused by one was refused by all and a fix in one was a
# fix in none.
#
# ⛔⭐⭐ THE DEFECT, hq_S's own words and their own two rows (2026-09-11): the old extractor was
#   awk '{for(i=1;i<=NF;i++){if($i !~ /^[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*=/){print $i; exit}}}'
# -- it SPLITS ON WHITESPACE and takes the first field that is not a NAME= prefix. Feed it the ordinary shape
#   D=$(mktemp -d) && bash scripts/test_x.sh
# and the fields are `D=$(mktemp` (skipped: it matches NAME=) and then `-d)`, which is not a command. The row
# is reported PERMANENTLY UNCLOSEABLE although it parses under bash -n and runs to rc=0. It bit
# snobol4-return-at-level-zero-crashes-instead-of-error-242 -- a row that had just been CURED -- and
# snobol4-error-243-non-name-nreturn-result-is-not-raised-where-sbl-halts.
# ⭐ THE SHAPE, which is the reusable half: THE ARM ASKED "IS THE FIRST WORD A COMMAND" AND ANSWERED IT BY
# SPLITTING ON SPACES -- a narrower question than the one it meant, the same family as $? after a pipeline and
# as `command -v icont` read as "does it exist". An instrument that answers a narrower question never says so.
# ⛔ AND THE COST LANDED ON THE ROW, NOT THE READER: hq_S worked around it by rewriting two DONE-WHENs to avoid
# a space inside a substitution. A gate that makes seats write worse criteria to please it has inverted its job.
#
# WHAT THIS DOES INSTEAD: a character scanner that respects the quoting and nesting bash respects -- '...',
# "...", `...`, $(...) to any depth, ${...} -- so an assignment prefix is consumed AS ONE WORD however many
# spaces live inside its substitution. It then skips shell operators and reserved words and returns the first
# real command word. ⛔ IT NEVER EXECUTES ANYTHING and never expands anything.
#
# ⛔⭐ AND IT REPORTS "NOT STATICALLY RESOLVABLE" RATHER THAN GUESSING. When the first command word is itself a
# substitution or a quoted string ($SCRIP, "$R/scrip", `which x`), NO static check can say whether it resolves,
# and the honest answer is neither PASS nor FAIL: donewhen_first_word prints nothing and the caller skips the
# resolution arm (bash -n has already proved the line parses). A checker that cannot measure says so -- it does
# not convict. That is the same rule the suites live under, applied to one word.
