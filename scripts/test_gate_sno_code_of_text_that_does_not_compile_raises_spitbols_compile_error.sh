# THE ROW (ceo CEO-1442, the cfo's report): snobol4-code-of-text-that-does-not-compile-fails-silently-where-spitbol-raises-the-
# compile-error. CODE(' X = (1') under SETEXIT is trapped as error 226 in sbl -bf; SCRIP's CODE failed with &ERRTYPE 0 and raised
# nothing, both modes. The CODE analogue of the EVAL cure e9213711a (test_gate_sno_eval_of_text_that_does_not_compile_raises_...).
#
# SPITBOL'S RULE (sbl.min cmpil cmp13-cmp31, scngf, scane, expan; measured on sbl -bf by the cfo 2026-10-02): CODE compiles its
# text statement by statement (';' ends one, column 1 is the label) and RAISES the first compile error with its number: the
# expression errors 220-233 in a field, and the statement's own -- 214 a bad first character, 218 a duplicated goto field, 219 a ':'
# with no field, 227/228 a goto's right paren or bracket missing, 234 a goto element that opens with neither ( nor <, 212 an empty
# goto -- and the compile-time pre-evaluation errors (X = -POS(0) is 10). Under SETEXIT it is trapped, and after CONTINUE the CODE
# still fails with &ERRTYPE kept; at &ERRLIMIT > 0 it is counted; at &ERRLIMIT 0 the CODE simply fails and the run goes on -- the
# same stage rule as EVAL's.
# THE CURE (runtime_eval.c): when SCRIP's own parser has rejected the text, code_sb_syntax splits it into statements and fields
# and names the error SPITBOL raises first (each field through eval_sb_syntax, the goto field by cmp13's loop), and code_at raises
# it in the EVAL stage at each of its three failure exits; a pre-evaluation error raises its own number. Text SCRIP's parser accepts
# is never classified, and text the classifier finds no error in fails silently as before, so no CODE call that works today changes.
# NOT COVERED, AND WHY: where SCRIP's parser and sbl's disagree about whether the text compiles -- '*comment' and ' X = 1 :S (L1)'
# compile in sbl and fail in SCRIP, ' X = 1 :' (219 in sbl) compiles in SCRIP -- the parser's acceptance is a class of its own. So
# is the order of a pre-evaluation error in an earlier statement against a syntax error in a later one (the syntax error is raised).
#
# Each arm grades the evaluator's lines for one text, both modes, against sbl -bf cut AT RUN TIME; the run stays under 32 trapped
# errors (a trap still nests). FAIL-ONCE, MEASURED: this gate on the parent (SCRIP ddf5c1a60, the cure stashed) reads all four arms
# RED, both modes -- no text trapped, 'failed 0' (the two pre-evaluation texts 'failed 10' and 'failed 2', still untrapped), and
# the &ERRLIMIT arms 'failed 0 limit 10'; on the cure 4/4. rc=0 clean · rc=1 a divergence · rc=2 REFUSAL.
