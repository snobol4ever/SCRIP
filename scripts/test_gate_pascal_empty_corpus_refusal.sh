# 2026-09-13, measured, row pascal-gates-report-a-one-runner-refusal-as-an-unpopulated-master). ⭐ THE PROOF, because
# asserting blindness is not measuring it: with the `MASTER_EXAMINED -eq 0` refusal -- the exact thing this file exists
# to guard -- DELETED OUTRIGHT from both gates on this tree, the old body printed "✅ GATE OK" and exited 0. It was
# satisfied by rc=1, an ORDINARY RED: the absent master booked one FAIL and the gate failed its own `[ $FAIL -eq 0 ]`,
# non-zero for a reason that has nothing to do with refusing. A gate that passes over the deletion of the thing it
# guards is not weak, it is blind. ⛔ A FIRST ATTEMPT AT THIS PROOF RAN THE STRIPPED COPIES OUT OF A SCRATCH DIRECTORY
# AND WAS CONTAMINATED -- they refused rc=2 on the stale-binary preflight ("artifact not built") before reaching any
# arm, so it demonstrated a real blindness by an accidental mechanism and would have been quoted for the wrong one.
# The measurement above is the in-tree one. ⭐ It is the cto's control_f shape from the same evening: a NAME asserting
# a role the measurement contradicts. ARM 1 now asserts WHICH refusal fired, by message; ARM 2 is the positive control
# that gives ARM 1 its power -- the same message must be ABSENT on the real, populated corpus, or ARM 1 is matching
# something that fires unconditionally, which is a way to be green about nothing.
