# THE ROW: prolog-a-module-qualified-goal-runs-its-goal-call-m-g-is-an-existence-error-on-colon-2 (hq_prolog, rank 1; the
# gateway of the tabling class: tabling_testlib's compare_real_expected_answers/3 runs findall(.., M:G2, ..)). SCRIP has
# one namespace, so Module:Goal runs Goal. Two arms, one per road: the LOWERER strips an atom-qualified body goal
# (lower_prolog.c goal_inner: lists:append(..) lowers as append(..), resolved statically), and the PRELUDE defines ':'/2..
# ':'/9 for the run-time road (call(user:G), call(M:G, X), a qualified goal held in a variable), with M unbound an
# instantiation_error as swipl raises it.
#
# THE ARM: 13 lines -- findall over user:p(X), call(user:G), call(M:G, X) through a closure, a qualified body goal,
# call/3 over a qualified closure, success and failure, a doubly qualified goal, an unbound module, \+ and forall/2
# over a qualified goal, a module held in a variable -- the ref cut from SWI-Prolog 9.0.4, in both modes.
# rc=0 clean · rc=1 a divergence · rc=2 REFUSAL.
