# gc-the-emitter-emits-the-poll-not-the-template, rung 1; the ceo's CEO-898 proposal).
#
# WHAT THIS GATE HOLDS. The poll is placed by hand, one judgement per call site, and that method has cost four
# broken batches. The cure is for THE EMITTER to emit it, because the emitter already routes every named runtime
# call through one function (x86_rtcc_call) whose first act is a symbol-keyed table lookup (x86_rtcc_clob).
# The one thing the emitter cannot do today is know WHICH callees allocate: that set is derived from the built
# libscrip_rt.so, and the emitter is compiled INTO that .so. So the set becomes a CHECKED-IN GENERATED TABLE,
# and this gate refuses a table that disagrees with the binary's own call graph.
#
# ⛔ WHY THE RETURN CLASS IS IN THE TABLE AND NOT INFERRED LATER. The poll's SHAPE depends on it: a VOID return
# needs the bare poll; a DESCR_t return may be spilled as a descriptor cell into the swept range and relocated
# (6.5b); anything else -- a long, an int, a pointer, a 16-byte struct that is NOT a DESCR -- must go BELOW the
# poll's floor, because gc_zeta_frame visits any word inside a heap block RAW and rewrites it when the block
# slides (6.5c). Getting that wrong in the DESCR direction is silent corruption, which is why arm 2's planted
# violation is exactly a class widened from OTHER to DESCR.
#
# ⛔⭐ AND THE FINDING THIS ROW TURNED UP ON ITS FIRST GENERATION, WHICH ARM 4 NOW HOLDS SO IT CANNOT COME BACK.
# The derivation recorded `call` edges only. The hand-written asm allocators in src/runtime/rtx/rtx_alloc.s --
# rt_str_alloc and rt_agg_alloc -- reach the carve by a TAIL JUMP and never execute `call rt_gcheap_alloc`, so
# they AND everything that reaches the heap only through them read NON-ALLOCATING: 99 functions, the SNOBOL4
# string builtins among them (DUPL_fn, REVERS_fn, SUBSTR_fn, TRIM_fn, BCHAR_fn, _CHAR_, _COLLECT_, _ITEM_).
# Downstream that put 27 emitter call sites OUTSIDE THE DENOMINATOR ENTIRELY -- neither polled nor counted
# unpolled -- in the very number the GC emergency is steered by: allocating_call_sites 210 -> 237, unpolled
# 97 -> 123. A tail jump IS an edge for the question this census asks, because control reaches the target, the
# target may allocate, and it returns past us to OUR caller with the caller's frame live.
#
# ⛔ AND THE QUESTION THIS GATE ASKS ABOUT ITSELF, carried from CTO-78 where a gate was found grading a class its
# population did not contain: DOES THIS INSTRUMENT'S POPULATION CONTAIN AN INSTANCE OF WHAT IT GRADES? Arm 3 reds
# unless every return class the table distinguishes actually occurs in it. A table that were all one class would
# make the column vacuous while reading green.
#
# ⭐ RUNG 1 LANDS THE TABLE AND ITS GATE, NOT YET A CONSUMER. The emitter reads it in rung 2 (the regime switch
# and the poll shapes) and rung 3 flips one family through the hook with NO template edit. Stated so the absent
# consumer is a declared rung and not an oversight; the freshness arm is what keeps the table from rotting until
# then.
