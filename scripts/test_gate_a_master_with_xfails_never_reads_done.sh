# (coo 2026-09-08, ceo CEO-416, on Lon's FACT RULE of 2026-09-03: "there is no such thing now as
#  XFAIL. We are shooting for 100%.")
#
# ⛔ AN XFAIL COUNTS AS A FAIL, SO A MASTER CARRYING ONE IS NOT DONE HOWEVER ITS FRACTION READS.
# THE DEFECT, and the coo walked into it before the ruling: the SNOBOL4 master row read 1894/1894
# FAIL=0 and the banner printed it ✅ done, while 27 known-red entries sat OUTSIDE BOTH SIDES of that
# fraction. Dropping a red from the numerator AND the denominator renders it as if it did not exist --
# wrong in the flattering direction, on the row Lon's 100% question gets answered from. Three seats
# rendered that row four different ways in one evening and every one of them printed "done".
#
# ⭐ THIS GATE IS DELIBERATELY INDEPENDENT OF WHICH FRACTION THE ROW CARRIES. The convention question
# (1871/1898 vs 1898/1898 vs 1894/1894) is the ceo's to settle and was still open when this landed;
# what is NOT open is that a suite with a live xfail must never render as finished. So the arms assert
# the DONE VERDICT, never the numbers -- a gate that pinned the fraction would have to be rewritten by
# whichever way the ruling went, and would have been wrong in the meantime.
#
# HERMETIC: scratch SUITES.tsv + corpus tree under mktemp, via S4E_SUITES_TSV. The real records are
# never opened for writing, asserted by arm 4.
