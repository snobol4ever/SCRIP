# bench_triangulate_snocone.sh -- Snocone benchmark board vs its SNOBOL4 twin (row
# readme-perf-grids-three-angles-all-seven, I26). Snocone compiles into the same engine as SNOBOL4
# (README § Snocone), so "the SNOBOL4 twin" -- the identical kernel hand-translated into SNOBOL4 syntax,
# both graded against the same output -- is the fair rival here, per this task's own GOAL text.
#
# METHOD: callgrind Ir per kernel (valgrind --tool=callgrind against SCRIP m4 and against the CLEAN
# SPITBOL benchmark oracle), NOT wall-clock -- per hq_P's live-load ruling this session (box at 20-30
# load, 16-seat fleet running; wall-clock is noise right now, callgrind is contention-immune). Multiple =
# SPITBOL_Ir / SCRIP_Ir (reference/ours, the FASTER axis -- RULES.md § THE TWO-NUMBER BENCHMARK BASIS's
# unit rule; above 1.00x SCRIP is faster). m3 Ir is reported separately, never folded into the m4-vs-SPITBOL
# multiple, because m3's total includes SCRIP's own in-process compile (same caveat as the Icon demo grid).
# ⛔ ORACLE: the CLEAN benchmark oracle only (lib_oracle_flags.sh:sbl_clean_bin(), -bf) -- never
# x64/bin/sbl, whose monitor-IPC bridge costs ~2.2-3.5x Ir and would misreport every number here.
#
# EXIT: 0 = every kernel measured on both engines. 2 = REFUSED -- missing scrip/valgrind/oracle/corpus.

# divided by it.  A crash that announces itself as a number is worse than one that announces itself as a
# hole; the lib is the ONE place that rule lives, for every Ir cell in the tree.  A caller that cannot load
# it REFUSES rather than re-deriving a private extraction (same law as lib_perf_fmt.sh / lib_oracle_flags.sh).
