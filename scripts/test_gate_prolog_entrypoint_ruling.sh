# test_gate_prolog_entrypoint_ruling.sh — the executable DONE-WHEN for postoffice row
# `prolog-scrip-auto-invokes-main-without-initialization-directive` (hq_C ruling, 2026-08-29).
#
# THE RULING IT ENFORCES, in one line: SCRIP's auto-invoke of `main/0` on a file carrying no
# `:- initialization(main).` is SANCTIONED (an entry-point convention, byte-faithful to the oracle
# once the oracle is invoked with the matching convention) — but "main/0 is the ONLY entry point"
# is a DEFECT with two faces, and those are the two cure rows this gate requires to exist.
#
# ⭐ WHY A GATE AND NOT A PROSE LINE: the ruling's REASON is a measurable claim ("scrip agrees with
# swipl once the goal is supplied on the command line"). RULES.md § TWO-PART PROOF requires a stated
# mechanism to bear weight, so arm C below RE-DERIVES the reason on every run instead of trusting it.
# A ruling whose reason silently stops being true is exactly the "correct procedure, false explanation"
# class this project has been bitten by repeatedly.
#
# ⛔ ARM D IS NOT DECORATION: it proves the cure hq_P proposed (`swipl -q -g main -t halt`) is UNSAFE
# to apply fleet-wide, because it DOUBLE-RUNS every file that does carry the directive. The invocation
# must be selected per-file. A gate that asserted only arm C would license exactly that mistake.
