#   and-changes-its-fingerprint-per-poll-set` (ceo CEO-979 GC-only, MODE TENET condition 1).
#
# WHAT IT GATES.  A SNOBOL4 pattern variable whose whole value is a BARE DEFERRED EXPRESSION (`lvl2 = *lvl1`)
# makes `SNO$MKEXPR` mint a `DT_X` name string with `rt_heap_strdup_c` IN THE COLLECTED HEAP, and the defer road
# reads it back after the allocating call's safe point.  If a collection lands between the mint and the read, the
# block is reclaimed IN PLACE (address identical at mint and at use in all seven readings) and `NV_GET_fn` answers
# the null string, so THE WHOLE MATCH FAILS SILENTLY WITH rc=0.  This gate walks a STRESS BAND at the tiny arena
# and grades every point against the ORACLE, because the failure is a plausible wrong answer and no rc can see it.
#
# ⛔ WHY THE REFS ARE CUT LIVE FROM THE ORACLE INSTEAD OF BEING COMMITTED BESIDE THE WITNESSES.  Two reasons, and
# the second is the one that decided it.  (1) A committed `.ref` is a snapshot of the oracle, and a gate that
# re-cuts cannot drift from it.  (2) ⭐ MEASURED 2026-09-20, BEFORE LANDING: putting these ten witnesses in
# `scripts/gc_witnesses/` would have moved `test_gate_gc_a_safe_point_stores_into_a_mapped_slot.sh`'s ratchet from
# members=162 undecidable=42 to members=192 undecidable=50, because that arm's population is a DIRECTORY GLOB
# (`scripts/gc_witnesses/*.sno` and friends) -- so it would have printed "THE CLASS GREW ... a new safe point
# stores outside its frame map" when nothing of the kind happened and nine test files had arrived.  A ratchet whose
# population is a glob cannot tell a compiler regression from a colleague's witness.  Reported to the `cto`, whose
# row owns that gate, with the measured delta; these witnesses stay self-contained until they rule.
#
# THE POPULATION, ten programs, all ten graded against `sbl -bf`'s own answer in this same run:
#   w         the witness -- the bare deferred expression.  ORACLE: match
#   nodefer   THE CONTROL -- the witness with the ONE load-bearing ingredient removed (`lvl2 = lvl1`).  A red here
#             is not this defect: it says the whole road is broken, and the gate says so by name.
#   a_dupl a_trim a_replace a_substr    the same four allocating builtins called PLAINLY (no defer road)
#   d_dupl d_trim d_substr d_replace    the same four called INSIDE `*(...)` on the defer road
# ⭐ The eight siblings are what make the witness's reds a WITNESS and not a class: they share the allocator, the
# unrooted `out` descriptor and a byte-identical emitted window, and they are green at every point of the band.
#
# ⛔ THE UNIT IS A RED NAME SET, NEVER A COUNT, AND THE TWO MODES DIVERGE IN *WHERE*.  On base at 2026-09-20 the
# reds are m3 {1,2,4,8} and m4 {1,2}: a band point is a property of WHERE THE COLLECTION LANDS, not of the defect
# (modes 3 and 4 may diverge as optimization choices, Lon 2026-08-28).  So this gate never asserts a count and
# never asserts a particular point -- it asserts that every witness answers its oracle at every point it walks.
#
# THE CURE THIS GATE IS WAITING ON IS NOT IN A SNOBOL4 FILE, SAID HERE SO THE NEXT READER IS NOT SENT AT THE WRONG
# ONE (hq_snobol4 2026-09-20, verified A/B/A by the `cto`, taken by the `cfo` as CFO-138): `gc_heap.c` spells
# "which descriptor kinds carry a heap payload" TWICE and the copies disagree by two kinds -- `gc_visit_one` (the
# heap visitor) has `DT_X`, `gc_cell_visit` (the EMITTED-STACK cell recognizer) does not, and `DT_X` occurs in the
# whole file exactly once.  Adding it to `gc_cell_visit`'s first arm took the 340-arm band from 6 red to 0 red with
# nothing traded.  ⛔ DO NOT ALSO ADD `DT_SNUL`: it is `0x00` with NO heap payload, `gc_cell_visit` is applied
# SPECULATIVELY at every 8-byte step of the spine walk, and admitting a zero tag would make any zero word pair
# whose second word lands in the arena look like a cell -- the collector GUESSING, which CEO-812 froze out.  That
# half is an ARGUMENT from the tag layout and NOT a measurement, and it is labelled as one wherever it appears.
#
# ⭐ IT IS ALREADY RUN, AND SAYING SO IS THE POINT -- `make test-arena` SWEEPS EVERY `scripts/test_gate_gc_*.sh`
# (Makefile:152), so this gate joins Lon's mandatory tiny-arena pass the moment it lands: NOT UNREACHED, JUST NOT
# IN THE BLOCKING SET.  That pass's own recipe line says every RED in it is a collector finding that owes a ROW,
# and this one owes exactly that -- the row is this seat's, the cure is the `cfo`'s CFO-138, and the receipt is in
# the finding named below.  ⭐ It also does not change that pass's verdict today: `test_gate_gc_a_safe_point_stores_
# into_a_mapped_slot.sh` arm (f) is ALREADY red on this tree for THIS SAME defect, 4 of 12 stress points, measured
# here before this gate was committed.  A second, wider reading of one live defect is not a second defect.
#
# ⭐ WIRED INTO `make test` -- THE BLOCKING SET -- ON 2026-09-20, AND THE HOLD-OUT BEFORE IT WAS THE POINT.  This
# gate landed UNWIRED and said so on the day it landed: the blocking set is essentially serial and shared by ten
# seats (MODE TENET condition 2), so a knowingly-red arm ahead of its cure charges every one of them and buys
# nothing.  It was wired the sitting `DT_X` reached origin in `gc_cell_visit` (the `cfo` at 83b8bc9d2, CFO-138,
# four spellings) and NOT ON THE ARGUMENT THAT IT WOULD NOW BE GREEN -- it was RE-WALKED ON THAT TREE FIRST, at
# `GC_BAND_FULL=1`: 340 arms, 6 red -> 0 red, and the 334 that were already green STAYED GREEN, nothing traded.
# ⛔ THE HOLD-OUT IS THE REUSABLE PART, NOT THE WIRING: a gate held out of the blocking set must say so in its own
# header, name the cure it waits on, and carry the one line that wires it -- otherwise it is the CEO-381 class, a
# gate that exists and grades nothing, and no reader can tell that from an oversight.  This block is what that
# declaration looks like after it is discharged; the wiring line now lives in `test-sequential` beside the other
# `test_gate_gc_*` arms, with its measured duration and this same history in its provenance comment.
#
# BAND: default 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 8 16 25.  `GC_BAND_FULL=1` walks the full 17 points to 50, for a base-vs-head
# reading rather than a per-landing arm.
# ⛔⭐ WHY 16 AND 25 ARE IN THE DEFAULT THOUGH NO RED ON THIS POPULATION HAS EVER BEEN ABOVE 8 (ceo CEO-1024,
# measured by hq_raku and paid for by reversing their own green): the fleet graded GC health at stress 1, 3 and
# 5; hq_raku went to 16 on the raku master at the tiny arena and lost 65 gradings over 36 DISTINCT PROGRAMS,
# every one exit 0 with a plausible wrong answer.  A BAND THAT ENDS WHERE THE KNOWN DEFECTS START MEASURES THE
# BAND AND NOT THE COMPILER.  The two extra points cost ten arms per witness pair and would have caught that
# class on this population; they are cheap exactly because this gate's witnesses are small.
