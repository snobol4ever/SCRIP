# test_gate_icn_an_external_value_answers_type_image_copy_identity_and_sort_as_iconx.sh -- AN ICON EXTERNAL VALUE (a block a loaded C
# function makes with alcexternal) ANSWERS type(), image(), copy(), === AND sort() AS ICONX DOES, IN BOTH MODES (hq_icon 2026-09-27,
# crawl work under CEO-1336: Arizona general/extlvals; Lon granted the one new counter, g_agg_external_ser, in-chat 19:1x).
#
# iconx's rexternal.r and ralc.r are the contract: alcexternal rounds the block to whole words and numbers it from ONE serial shared by
# every external; type() is the block's extlname or "external"; image() is its extlimage or <name>_<id>(<data words>); copy() is its
# extlcopy or the value itself; === is block identity; sort() collates externals after records (order 12), by the library's extlcmp
# when both share a function list and it has one, else by type name and then id. SCRIP had alcexternal as a stub that raised 216. The
# witness calls the distribution's own libcfunc.so (extxmin: a minimal external; extxstr: name and image callbacks; extxreal: name,
# image, cmp and copy callbacks) through loadfunc on an absolute path, so no FPATH and no linked io.icn is involved; expectations come
# from a live iconx run. On the tree before the cure the first call dies with error 216 (red).
