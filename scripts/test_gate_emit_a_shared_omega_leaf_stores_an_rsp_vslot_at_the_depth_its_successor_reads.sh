# THE DEFECT (row emit-an-rsp-relative-vslot-assigned-in-a-box-that-two-binop-test-omega-edges-reach-at-different-spine-depths-
# is-stored-at-the-wrong-depth, hq_pascal 2026-09-26, SCRIP aa3adedf8's message; met again by the coo 2026-10-02 as a cross-
# language red of the cto's f8acc813e): two tests in one zd run whose omega edges reach ONE shared leaf (a value context's
# false leaf: LIT 0 -> ASSIGN __tmp -> VAR __tmp) used to have that leaf's run seeded at the zout of the FIRST such test in
# node order. When the first test is the shallower one (a call before the test of its result), the leaf ran shallow, stored
# the rsp-relative temporary there, and only then pushed (add rsp, -N) to meet its successor's depth -- so the successor
# read the TRUE leaf's cell. Pascal's write(eoln(input)) after a read at end of line printed the previous iteration's
# true; fpc -Miso prints false. f8acc813e made IR_CALL an omega test, which turned eoln's call into that first test.
# THE CURE (emit.cpp zd_omega_seed): the shared omega head is seeded at the DEEPEST zout among the same-run tests that reach
# it, the depth the true arm starts at -- so any reconciliation is a push on an omega edge, before the leaf stores anything,
# and the leaf stores at the depth its successor reads.
#
# Two programs x two modes, their expected lines cut from fpc 3.2.2 -Miso on 2026-10-02 (hermetic: the oracle is never
# called). rc=0 clean · rc=1 a divergence · rc=2 REFUSAL.
