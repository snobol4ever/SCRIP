# test_gate_out_sweep_flaky.sh — NEGATIVE TEST for util_out_sweep.sh face (c), the intermittent-crash false mover.
#   bash scripts/test_gate_out_sweep_flaky.sh          (no args; ~10s; needs ./scrip built)
# ⛔ WHY BY INJECTION AND NOT BY THE LIVE WITNESS.  The natural witness is `141_pat_eval_double_fn_arbno` (seat1
# s170: m3 rc=0 serially, intermittent load-dependent rc=139 under a parallel sweep).  Measured s185 at SCRIP
# ffbc1425 on 16 cpus it is DORMANT — 14 full sweeps (8 sequential + 6 concurrent, 8162 rows) and 648 direct runs
# at up to 32-way parallelism produced ZERO instances.  A defence validated by a flake that only sometimes appears
# is a defence validated sometimes, so the flakiness is INJECTED here: an arm wrapper stands in for $SCRIP and
# alternates 141 between rc=139 and the real run on a shared counter.  The alternation is COUNTER-DRIVEN, never
# random — a nondeterministic gate for a nondeterminism defence would be the same mistake one level up.
# ⭐ THE INJECTION IS NOT MERELY THE SAME SHAPE, IT IS THE SAME TWO VALUES: seat1's s170 FINDING §7b records 141
# flipping `RUN_RC_139` ↔ md5 `027851e5…`, and that is exactly the pair this gate's assertion 1 prints.  The real
# run supplies the md5 (only the crash face is faked), so the reproduction stays anchored to the live compiler.
# THE THREE ASSERTIONS (all three must hold, and 3 is the one that keeps the cure from becoming a blindfold):
#   1 REPRODUCED  — at REPS=1 the false mover appears, in BOTH directions (crash→md5 and md5→crash), from ONE arm
#                   compared against ITSELF.  This is the s170 instrument gap, on demand.
#   2 CAUGHT      — at REPS=3 both arms label it RUN_FLAKY, the diff is EMPTY, and both `.flaky` sidecars name it.
#   3 NOT BLINDED — a program the injected arm STABLY changes still reads as a mover at REPS=3, and a genuinely
#                   stable program still reads as no-mover.  RUN_FLAKY suppresses the coin flip, not the signal.
#   4 PIN         — a pinned flake prints `pinned`, a pin whose program came back stable prints `stale pin`.  The
#                   pin file is REPORTING ONLY; assertion 3 is what proves it never becomes an exclusion list.
