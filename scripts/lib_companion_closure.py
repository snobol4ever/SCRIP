"""THE ONE COMPANION RESOLVER: which files does a master-suite entry name, and where do they live.
AUTHORS: Lon Jones Cherryholmes · Claude Opus 5   DATE: 2026-09-05
⛔⭐⭐ WHAT THE GRADER CAN ACTUALLY REACH, WHICH IS WIDER THAN _copy_companions AND NARROWER THAN THE CORPUS. A suite entry
is graded in a FRESH temp dir, so it sees only what is copied in -- but the driver's include search is not just the file's own
directory. `src/driver/scrip.c:963-995` builds it per input file: the source's own dir, then EVERY colon-separated dir in
$SNO_LIB, then an UPWARD WALK of the source's ancestors adding each `<anc>/include`, `<anc>/lib`, `<anc>/library`, then ".".
And corpus_suite_harness sets `SNO_LIB=<corpus>/include` on every m3 run and every m4 compile (run_m3/compile_m4), for every
language. So `-INCLUDE 'global.inc'` DOES resolve at grading time even though global.inc is nowhere near the master.
⛔⭐⭐ THAT IS THE TRAP THIS FILE IS REALLY ABOUT, AND IT COST THIS SEAT A WRONG FINDING BEFORE IT COST ANYONE ELSE ANYTHING.
The two halves of the resolution live in different places -- one in an env var the harness sets, one in an upward walk that
only fires INSIDE the corpus tree -- so the SAME entry resolves under the board and fails under a hand run from /tmp with a
hard "cannot open include", which reads as a compiler defect. Measured twice in one fleet: two ALL.xfail notes written
2026-09-04 say a witness is "unresolved from the flat master" -- true of a hand run, false of the board that greens it -- and
this seat reproduced the identical mistake on 2026-09-05 and filed it as a 26-entry class before grading through
run_suite_entry and finding 23 of those 25 entries PASS.
⭐ SO THE QUESTION THIS LIBRARY ANSWERS IS NARROW AND WORTH ASKING: which named companions can the grader reach AT ALL, and
which exist in this corpus somewhere it cannot? The second set is the real defect class -- an entry graded against a
dependency that is simply absent -- and materializing those beside the master (tests/<lang>/config/, Lon's flat end state)
both cures it and makes the entry SELF-CONTAINED, so a hand run and the board finally agree.
⛔ THE PATH IS DECLARED, NEVER A CORPUS-WIDE BASENAME SCAN, and that is not fastidiousness -- it is measured. `VBGinTASA.dat`
resolves to THREE files in this corpus, and benchmarks/snocone/demo/VBGinTASA.dat is a DIFFERENT file (md5 48c78061) from the
two identical snobol4 ones (98e80802). A basename index would have picked one by walk order and graded a snobol4 entry
against another language's data with nothing in any output saying so.
⛔ AMBIGUITY REFUSES. Two declared dirs holding the same basename with different content is unresolvable BY THE CALLER, and
picking the first is exactly the silent wrong answer above. Identical content is not ambiguity -- first wins, no complaint.

# whole entry as a filename is in its comments). A second copy here could disagree with the grader about what a companion IS,
# and then this tool would materialize files the grader never asks for while missing ones it does.

    (the defect class; --write copies these beside the master) · `unresolvable` = named, found nowhere either list can see.

    ⭐ CLOSURE, NOT ONE LEVEL, AND ACROSS THE TWO CLASSES BOTH WAYS: an entry names A, A is already reachable but names B,
    and B lives only on the declared path -- so a reachable file must still be SCANNED even though nothing needs copying.
    (The mirror case, a materializable A naming a reachable B, is the one a naive "scan only what I copied" gets right by
    accident.) `seen` dispositions each name at most once, so a self-including file or a two-file cycle terminates.
    ⛔ UNRESOLVABLE IS REPORTED, NEVER A FAILURE HERE. Most unresolvable names are not files at all: the INPUT/OUTPUT
    pattern legitimately captures association names (FIN, RD) and flag strings ([-f0 -r4194304]), and two entries name a
    deliberately-absent target (nonexistent_target.sno) because THAT IS THE TEST. Distinguishing those from a genuinely
    lost companion is a judgement about the corpus, not something this function can measure -- so it hands back the list
