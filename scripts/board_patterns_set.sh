# SET-BASED board for crosscheck/patterns.  Replaces test_board_wreg_byset.sh, whose two-arm
# ON/OFF compare became VACUOUS when 855a12a physically deleted the SCRIP_WREG killswitch
# (it now survives only in two comments: bb_match_defer.cpp:83, bb_glue_flat.cpp:150).
# That script would report REPAIRED 0 / BROKEN 0 -- indistinguishable from "neutral change",
# but actually meaning "both arms ran identical bytes".  A green board with no signal behind it.
#
# The s17 law is preserved by comparing SETS ACROSS BUILDS instead of across a dead env arm:
#   a net count cannot distinguish 10-repaired/0-broken from 15/5.
#
# SERIAL BY CONSTRUCTION.  Parallel execution is NOT safe for this board: CPU contention pushes
# slow-but-crashing programs past the timeout and misclassifies SEGV as HANG (measured: 178, 179
# flipped SIG11->HANG at -P 8 / 10s).  The failure-mode split is the whole point, so do not
# reintroduce xargs -P here.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/board_patterns_set.sh snap <tag>        # measure, write set file
#   bash scripts/board_patterns_set.sh diff <old> <new>  # REPAIRED / BROKEN by set membership
