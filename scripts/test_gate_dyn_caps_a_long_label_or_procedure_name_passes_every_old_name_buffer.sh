# no-more-whack-a-mole-every-fixed-table-a-program-can-fill-is-converted-in-one-pass-..., CEO-1496 (3); ARCH-DYNAMIC-STORAGE.md section 5 (4):

# MEASURED 2026-10-03 on SCRIP d50a3e1f0: an indirect goto :($N) to a label of 251 characters or more answered "error 38: goto undefined label"
# where sbl -bf reaches it, at every length from 251 (the old cap: "LBL__" plus the name in a 256-byte buffer) to 1000; a direct goto was fine.
# Two buffers truncated the same name on the two sides of one lookup -- lower_snobol4.c registered LBL__<first 250 characters> (two lname[256]
# locals) and runtime_eval.c's rt_goto_resolve_x / rt_entry_resolve looked up LBL__<first 250> (two more) -- and bb_define.cpp's
# bb_ab_seal_entry_cells cut an entry cell's name at 294 characters (cell[300]), runtime_eval.c's runtime-compile prefix proc_<name> at 294
# (_m3pfx[300]). Each is now a stack array sized to the name at the construct's entry (the Lifetime Rule; fmt_len where a format sizes it).
# Arms, each in m3 and m4, each stream byte-identical to sbl -bf: A an indirect goto to a 300-character and to a 1000-character label;
# B one CODE block defining two functions whose 300-character names differ only in their last character, each called by EVAL in both orders.
# FAIL_ONCE=1 corrupts arm A's expected stream to prove the comparison trips.
