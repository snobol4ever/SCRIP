# test_gate_gc_the_flip_plant_turns_a_stale_pointer_into_a_located_fault.sh -- THE INSTRUMENT THAT MAKES "AIR TIGHT" A
# MEASUREMENT: under SCRIP_GC_PLANT_FLIP=1 every collection COPIES every live block to ground disjoint from its old address
# and poisons and PROT_NONEs ALL of the old ground until the next collection, so a stale copy of any heap address -- a holder
# the collector never visited -- FAULTS at the instruction that uses it, with a [ZGC-STALE] report naming the block, where
# it lived, where it went and the collection that moved it (cto 2026-09-23, CTO-155; ARCH-GC-COMPILE-TIME-FRAME-MAPS.md
# section 9 rung 1 "poison must trap, not merely lie", made complete).
#
# WHY THE EXISTING TRAP WAS NOT ENOUGH, MEASURED THE SAME DAY: SCRIP_GC_TRAP quarantines only whole pages above the new top,
# and ordinary compaction and SCRIP_GC_RELOC=1 both refill most vacated ground with other live blocks, so a stale read
# returns a plausible wrong answer (hq_icon's unitgenr: green under RELOC=1, red without it; the scan-bank witness of CTO-154:
# DIFF with rc=0 under every existing knob).  Under the flip plant the old ground holds nothing live, so nothing can make a
# stale read look right.  A pointer loaded FROM poisoned ground is 0xDBDB..., non-canonical, and faults with si_addr 0; the
# handler now reads the registers and names the poison (rt_gc_poison_reg_report).  ONE PRECISION CHANGE RIDES WITH IT, in
# every mode: gc_mark_blk ignores HB_FILL, because free space is never live and marking it would copy dead ground.
#
# ARMS: (a) NO FALSE POSITIVE: four witnesses answer their oracle-cut refs under the plant at stress 1 in mode 3 and mode 4
# and the GC-EXERCISE line reads flips > 0 (the plant applied); (b) LOCATED, MOVED: the scan-bank plant of CTO-154
# (SCRIP_GC_PLANT_SCAN_BANK=1) faults under the flip plant and the report says the block was MOVED; (c) LOCATED, POISON: the
# key-collision plant of CTO-153 faults and the report names a register holding the poison; (d) THE CONTRAST: without the
# flip plant the scan-bank plant is a SILENT wrong answer (rc 0, stdout differs) -- the flip plant is what turns it loud.
# FAIL_ONCE=1 runs arm (b) without the flip plant and requires it to red.
