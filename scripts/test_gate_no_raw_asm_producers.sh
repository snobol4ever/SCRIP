# test_gate_no_raw_asm_producers.sh — RAW PRODUCER ERADICATION (Lon 2026-08-13, in-chat: "Remove all
# 'raw producers', those are INVALID!!!  ALL should be funneled through x86_*() FAMILY of functions.
# And a SMALL family at that.").
#
# RULES.md TEMPLATE-ONLY EMISSION already says it: every x86 instruction — BINARY and TEXT — is
# produced ONLY inside x86(...) encoder internals.  A call site that hands emit_textf/emit_text_n a
# hand-written assembly string is a RAW PRODUCER and is forbidden: it bypasses the encoders, so it
# cannot be re-targeted, cannot be counted, and (since the TAB rung) cannot carry field separators —
# it lands on the sink's legacy whitespace parse and re-introduces exactly the sniffing that rung
# deleted.  THE SINK'S LEGACY PARSE CANNOT BE DELETED UNTIL THIS COUNT REACHES ZERO.
#
# LEGITIMATE (not counted): handing the sink an ALREADY-BUILT string — emit_text_n(s.data(), s.size())
# — which is how every xa_*.cpp template already works, because that string was built by x86().
#
# Usage: bash scripts/test_gate_no_raw_asm_producers.sh [--list]
