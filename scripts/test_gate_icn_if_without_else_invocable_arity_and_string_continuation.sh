# icon-ipl-if-then-with-no-else-is-a-parse-error-in-expression-position,

#
# WHAT IT PINS -- three Icon surface-syntax classes the IPL package exposed, all three graded against the
# LIVE ORACLE rather than against a typed expectation, and all three in BOTH modes.
#
# 1. `if e1 then e2` WITH NO else. The cure touches BOTH if-sites -- parse_ctrl (expression position, where the bug bit) and parse_stmt (statement position, where the trailing match already absorbed the semicolon so behaviour is unchanged) -- so if_statement_position_control grades the second site rather than merely asserting it was safe. parse_ctrl() ate a TK_SEMICOL after the then-branch
#    so that `if a then b; else c` would work; with no else that semicolon WAS the statement terminator, and
#    the caller then reported `expected ; (got <next line's first token>)` -- a diagnostic pointing one line
#    PAST the construct it was complaining about, which is why it read as a mystery for so long. The cure
#    consumes the semicolon only when p->peek is TK_ELSE.
# 2. `invocable "op":n`. The entry loop broke at the colon, so the top-level loop restarted on `:` and said
#    `expected procedure, record, global, link, or invocable`.
# 3. A trailing `_` inside a "..." literal continues the string: the underscore, the newline, and the next
#    line's leading whitespace are all dropped.
#
# ⛔⭐ EVERY ARM CARRIES ITS CONTROL, AND THAT IS THE POINT. Each of the three cures makes a parser accept
# something it used to reject -- the cheap way for such a cure to be wrong is to ALSO change the construct it
# was already getting right. So `if/then/else` is graded beside `if/then`, `invocable a, b` beside
# `invocable "op":n`, and an interior `_` (which must stay a literal underscore) beside a trailing one. An
# arm with no control proves the new case works and says nothing about the 99 percent that already did.
#
# ⛔ THE ORACLE IS THE REFERENCE, NEVER A TYPED STRING. icont/iconx are reached through lib_oracle_flags.sh
# (never `command -v`, never a hardcoded path). If the oracle is unreachable this gate REFUSES rc=2 -- it
# never skips-as-success, because a gate that cannot measure must not print the success shape.
# ⛔⭐ MEASURED WHILE WRITING THIS GATE, AND IT INVERTS THE REASON THE BUG EXISTED. The semicolon-eating line
# was there to accept `if a then b; else c` -- and the ORACLE REJECTS THAT FORM outright ("else": invalid
# expression). So the swallow was serving a construct real Icon does not have, while breaking one it does.
# SCRIP still accepts it (the guard consumes the semicolon when the next token is `else`), which is a
# harmless over-acceptance and NOT a regression of this cure -- it is deliberately not pinned here, because
# a gate that pins an over-acceptance freezes it. Recorded so the next reader does not "restore" the swallow.
