# ⛔⭐ ARM 4 IS THE ONE THAT EARNS THIS GATE'S KEEP, and it is not about the ranker's output at all. The
# ranker's measurement is "files that MOVED into a graded bucket" -- a DIFFERENCE between two classifications.
# The day someone gives the ranker its own private copy of classify()/roast_bucket(), that difference starts
# measuring the two copies as much as it measures the cure, and it will do so SILENTLY and in the flattering
# direction: a ranker whose bucket rule is a shade more generous than the census's reports unlocks that the
# census will never confirm. No output check can catch that; only counting the definitions can.
# EXIT: 0 all arms pass · 1 an arm failed · 2 could not measure.

# three were innocent: board_demos_zeta.sh classifies SNOBOL4 demo outputs and test_icn_d2_suspend_witness.sh
# classifies Icon suspend witnesses. Neither has anything to do with roast. The arm asked "who defines a
# function NAMED classify" when the question was "who defines THE ROAST BUCKET RULE", and a generic name
# cannot tell those apart. \u2b50 THE LESSON, which outlives this gate: A UNIQUELY-NAMED FUNCTION IS ITS OWN
# RATCHET AND A GENERICALLY-NAMED ONE CANNOT BE COUNTED GLOBALLY. So roast_bucket() -- a name nothing else
# would pick -- is counted tree-wide, while classify() is policed where it actually matters: the two
# consumers must not define it, because a consumer that defines it has stopped sharing it.
