#!/usr/bin/env bash
# test_gate_emit_guard_sink_names_its_guard.sh -- the driver's two abort sinks are two DIFFERENT sentences,
# and the guard sink names the guard that fired.
#
# THE DEFECT (row emit-guard-sink-diagnostic-names-a-missing-template-when-a-live-cases-guard-fired): one
# function, drive_unowned, was both the default: case of emit_drive -- a genuinely missing template -- AND
# the guard sink inside 58 existing cases. For an op that plainly had a case it printed "has no template ...
# Implement op=N" and sent the reader to write something already there. Cured in 7d54b9354 by splitting it
# into drive_no_template (the default only) and drive_guard_refused(nd, __LINE__) (the other 58).
#
# ⛔⛔ WHY THIS GATE MANUFACTURES ITS TRIP INSTEAD OF FINDING ONE, which is the whole design and is a ceo
# ruling (CEO-554), not a convenience. The row originally asked for a gate that reaches a guard sink with a
# real program. MEASURED 2026-09-11: there is no such program. The witness the row itself cites,
# `x :=: (y := 5)`, is cured and prints 51 matching iconx; a compile-only sweep of 215 Icon package programs
# tripped the sink ZERO times; and the one live trip that did exist that day -- `create foo()` with foo
# undeclared -- was cured the same sitting (a4d95d5ff), which DESTROYED it. ⭐ THE GENERAL FORM, and the
# reason this is written on the gate rather than in a ledger nobody reads: A GATE ANCHORED ON A FOUND
# WITNESS, WHERE EVERY POSSIBLE WITNESS IS A DEFECT THE ORG IS ACTIVELY DELETING, GOES FROM GREEN TO
# REFUSING ON THE DAY SOMEONE DOES GOOD WORK. Anchoring here was not an option; the trip has to be made.
#
# ⛔ THE SEAM IS TEST-ONLY AND ARM 3 PROVES IT INERT. emit.cpp carries drive_plant_guard_sink(), a cached
# getenv on SCRIP_TEST_PLANT_GUARD_SINK in the same form as the sanctioned SCRIP_VARARG_TAIL and
# SCRIP_PROC_OPEN_P. Unset, it must change NOTHING -- arm 3 compiles a witness with the variable unset and
# requires byte-identical output to the same compile, and at landing 30 programs' .s were byte-identical to
# a build WITHOUT the seam at all. A test hook that alters the default path is a new global in disguise.
#
# ⭐ AND THE GREP VERSION IS REFUSED, by this seat and by the ceo: a gate that greps emit.cpp for two
# distinct message strings asserts that we still PRINT something, never that the guard still FIRES, and it
# would have read green through the entire window in which this sink was untrippable.
