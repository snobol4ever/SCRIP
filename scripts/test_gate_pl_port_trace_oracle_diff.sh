# test_gate_pl_port_trace_oracle_diff.sh -- THE PROLOG PORT-TRACE ORACLE DIFF, against SWI-Prolog's trace/0.
# (seat20 2026-09-05, row fuzz-crash-class-and-port-trace-refs-over-the-three-open-languages, hq_U task.)
#
# test_gate_pl_port_trace.sh is a SELF-CONSISTENCY PIN, by its own header's admission: "trace/0 emits goal
# events in its own format, not a Byrd four-port sequence over our box graph, so no line-for-line oracle
# diff exists to take." That line is the premise this gate falsifies: Prolog's own textbook 4-port tracer
# uses the EXACT SAME PORT NAMES this codebase's Byrd-box vocabulary was named after -- Call/Redo/Exit/Fail
# IS the Byrd box model, not an analogy to it -- so the "normalisation" is far thinner than Icon's or
# SNOBOL4's: mostly filtering, barely any renaming.
#
# WHY SWI, NOT GNU PROLOG (both are accessible via lib_oracle_flags.sh's swipl_bin/gprolog_bin): MEASURED
# 2026-09-05 on matched scratch witnesses -- swipl's trace/0, with `leash(-all)` to stop it waiting on a
# tty that is not there, writes Call:/Exit:/Redo:/Fail: lines to STDERR and leaves STDOUT carrying only the
# program's real output, cleanly separable exactly like SCRIP's own SCRIP_PL_TRACE convention. gprolog's
# `--consult-file` driver was measured to interleave its banner, compilation messages, trace lines AND
# program output all on ONE stream (stdout) with no separation -- unusable as a "does tracing perturb the
# answer stream" instrument without first solving a harder problem (silencing gprolog's own banner/compile
# noise) that is out of scope for this rung.
#
# ⛔⭐ POPULATION IS ONE HAND-WRITTEN CANARY WITNESS, NOT DRAWN FROM THE MASTER SUITE -- A DELIBERATE,
# NAMED DEPARTURE FROM EVERY OTHER GATE IN THIS FAMILY, explained in full because a silent one would read
# as an oversight. MEASURED 2026-09-05 on corpus/tests/prolog's own `rung05_backtrack_backtrack` family
# (list_directive_2.pl, a recursive member/2): SCRIP logs ONE Redo event PER ACTIVE STACK FRAME when
# backtracking unwinds through several live recursive calls of the SAME static box at once, where swipl's
# tracer logs a single Redo at the frame where a new alternative is actually tried -- a genuine
# instrumentation-granularity difference (20 SCRIP events vs 17 swipl events on that witness), not a bug in
# either engine, and NOT something a normalisation rule (drop-a-trailing-pair) can safely paper over without
# risking silently swallowing a REAL extra/missing event elsewhere in a multi-frame sequence. Recursive/
# multi-frame backtracking is therefore an EXPLICIT FOLLOW-UP GAP for hq_U, not silently assumed covered --
# the same shape as Icon's gate leaving plain (non-suspend) calls uncovered and saying so.
# The canary below (`color/1`, three facts, driven by an explicit `fail`-loop) isolates the one case that
# IS clean: non-recursive, single-frame, multi-clause backtracking. Even there, ONE named, ONE-DIRECTION
# normalisation is required and applied ONLY to SCRIP's side (see drop_trailing_choicepoint_pair below) --
# unlike Icon's SYMMETRIC trailing-pair drop, because the artifact here is asymmetric by measurement: SCRIP
# always leaves a choice point until a predicate's clauses are truly exhausted (one extra Redo+Fail pair);
# swipl's first-argument/last-clause indexing detects "blue" was the last matching fact and exits `color/1`
# deterministically, so it never emits that pair at all. WITNESSES ONLY, NEVER COMPILER FIXES: this gate
# does not attempt to make SCRIP perform the same choice-point elision -- that would be a compiler change,
# and squarely hq_U's to consider, not this rung's.
#
# NORMALISATION: SCRIP's `n<K>_call_proc_staged NAME/ARITY` box family (MEASURED: user-predicate calls
# only -- built-ins and internal dispatch fire through a DIFFERENT box family, `n<K>_call $unify` /
# `$findall_new` / `$write` / etc., which this filter already excludes just by grepping call_proc_staged
# specifically) maps Call/Redo/Exit/Fail -> alpha/beta/gamma/omega, arity dropped (`color/1` -> `color`) to
# match swipl's own bare-functor trace text once its argument list is dropped too, and the entry predicate
# (`main`, whose own Call/Exit swipl reports as a redo-driven interpreted loop where SCRIP reports a single
# compiled-box in/out -- an architectural difference, not a bug, see the m3/m4 "wiring IS the execution"
# design note in CLAUDE.md) is excluded from BOTH sides by name.
#
# REF: corpus/tests/prolog/ALL.trace.oracle -- deliberately NOT ALL.trace, which the self-pin sibling above
# already owns.
# EXIT: 0 the canary's alpha/beta/gamma sequence matches the oracle in both modes; 1 a mismatch or a
# perturbation/killswitch failure; 2 REFUSED (cannot measure).
