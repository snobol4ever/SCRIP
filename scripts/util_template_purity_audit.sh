# util_template_purity_audit.sh — IFT (IO-FREE-TEMPLATES) purity gate. [ADVISORY]
#
# STATUS: ADVISORY / OVER-APPROXIMATING (not yet a hard gate). The arm-scope
# tracking is line-based and does NOT track brace depth, so side-effect calls
# inside a MEDIUM_BINARY block that is NESTED within other conditionals (e.g.
# bb_capture's fnc-name sub-branch) can be mis-counted as non-binary. Treat the
# output as a candidate worklist, not a verdict. TODO (IFT-AUDIT-2): make the
# arm tracker brace-aware (push/pop MEDIUM_* scope on { }) before wiring into the
# session gate. Until then, run manually; cross-check flagged lines by hand.
#
# Invariant (Lon, 2026-05-27): every top-level BB/SM/XA emitter TEMPLATE function
# is a pure `state -> std::string`. NON-binary arms (MEDIUM_TEXT, MEDIUM_MACRO_DEF,
# PLATFORM_JVM/JS/NET/WASM) MUST contain no emission side effects — they build a
# std::string and RETURN it. The CALLER (the thin `extern "C"` dispatch wrapper at
# the bottom of each template file) is the ONLY place that touches a sink.
#
# THE ONE SANCTIONED EXCEPTION: the `MEDIUM_BINARY` arm. x86 binary emission of
# rel32 jumps/calls (`emit_jmp`/`emit_call_label`/`emit_label_define`) needs the
# patch list writing into `bb_emit_buf`, so those arms are imperative and return
# an empty std::string by design (see HQ THREE-MEDIUM + the rel32 fork). Raw-byte
# `bb_sink_str(bytes(...)+...)` is likewise the sanctioned binary sink. This audit
# therefore IGNORES side-effect calls that occur inside a MEDIUM_BINARY block.
#
# A FAIL means a non-binary arm emits via side effect instead of returning a string.
#
# Usage: bash scripts/util_template_purity_audit.sh
# Exit 0 = GREEN (no non-binary violations), 1 = violations found.
