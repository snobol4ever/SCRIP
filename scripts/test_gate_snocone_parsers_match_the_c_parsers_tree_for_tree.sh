# test_gate_snocone_parsers_match_the_c_parsers_tree_for_tree.sh -- THE SELF-HOSTED PARSERS PRINT THE SAME TREE AS SCRIP'S OWN
# PARSERS, FILE BY FILE (Lon 2026-09-27, in-chat to hq_snocone, verbatim: "Write a C function to dump the AST. Write an
# equivalent Snocone function to dump the tree. ... Get the trees to match 100%."; and 2026-09-28: "So change from concat one big
# file to run each parser seperatly."; ceo CEO-1340, the row's DONE-WHEN).
#
# THE INSTRUMENT: out/parser_<lang> (src/tools/parser_main.c, one frontend per build, printing through ir_dump_tree in
# src/ir/ast_print.c) and the .sc chain + bootstrap/parser_<lang>.sc printing through TreeDump in bootstrap/tdump.sc -- ONE
# FORMAT, byte for byte: one node per line, two spaces per depth, "(TT_KIND value" then the children then ")"; strings quoted with
# the CQize escapes, integers decimal, reals as %g; the five bookkeeping attributes :line :lline :file :stno :src are printed by
# NEITHER side (the one named exclusion, the same list in both dumpers). Each .sc parser reads its whole input in ONE read (Lon
# 2026-09-28: INPUT(.INPUT, 9, '[-f0 -r16777215]') then Src = INPUT) and matches it with ONE POS(0) ... RPOS(0) pattern.
#
# POPULATION, EACH FILE ALONE: per landing the files of corpus/benchmarks/<lang>; with GATE_POPULATION=corpus or under the bus's
# closure run (S4E_DONE_WHEN_RUN=1) every corpus program of the language (every *.<ext> outside .git and corpus/library, not
# ALL.*) -- the whole-corpus run is a closure run, one at a time (CEO-1341). Each file goes to the C parser and to the .sc parser
# compiled ONCE per language to a mode-4 binary (Lon 2026-09-28: "forget mode 3 runs."), run at the largest arena on the file's own
# stdin; the two dumps are compared for THAT file. Raku is not graded yet: parser_raku.sc is the 2026-09-29 conversion of
# rk_syntax.c + rk_tree.c, not yet byte-identical on every corpus file, and its direct .sc compile hits a Snocone-frontend defect
# (a second statement hangs; its own transpile runs) -- it joins this gate the landing it matches 100%.
# THE TREE HASH (Lon 2026-09-29 18:5x CDT, in-chat to the ceo, verbatim: "You might consider creating a hash calculated of the
# trees to compare quickly success and delay the details." and "hashing the output tree is what I meant. In memory. Then output
# the one number per-test for comparison. It shows only how many do not match, not in what ay do they not match."): each side runs
# under PARSER_TREE_HASH=1 and prints ONE NUMBER per file instead of its tree -- h = (h * 256 + byte) mod (2^55 - 55) over every
# byte its dump would print (C: ir_dump_tree into a hashing stream, src/tools/parser_main.c; .sc: TreeDumpPut/TreeDumpEnd,
# bootstrap/tdump.sc) -- and the gate compares the numbers. THE CANARY: the first compared file of each language is also dumped in full on
# both sides and each number is re-derived from its dump here, so a hash that stopped folding cannot read as MATCH (rc 2).
# GATE_DETAIL=1 dumps the first DIFF file of each language in full and prints its first differing line pair. GATE_LANGS="snobol4 icon"
# grades those languages alone (a landing's own arm; the closure run grades all six).
# THE C SIDE DUMPS WHAT ITS PARSER BUILT (the ceo's row, CEO-1364: "the C side dumps the parse tree the .sc reproduces"): Icon
# before link resolution, Pascal before its semantic check, Rebus before rebus_lower, Prolog each clause's tree before
# prolog_lower (a clause list with a parse error is refused), Snocone code_to_ast of the statements its parser builds, SNOBOL4
# its parse -- never a FINISH step.
# VERDICT per language: files, hashes compared, MATCH, DIFF, REFUSED (by C, by .sc, by both), CRASH (by C: a signal; by .sc: a
# nonzero exit without Parse Error), COULD-NOT-MEASURE (a timeout), and the first red file. A C refusal is "Parse Error" or a
# nonzero exit below 128 (icon_compile_parse exits 1 on a syntax error). rc 0 = every file of every graded language MATCHes;
# rc 1 = a DIFF, a one-sided refusal or a crash on either side; rc 2 = could not measure. A file BOTH parsers refuse counts as
# agreement (neither built a tree), printed apart; a crash is never agreement.
# RED BY MEASUREMENT on 2026-09-28: the .sc and C trees differ in five shape classes (GOAL-SNOCONE-100.md cursor 2026-09-28b)
# until Lon's canonical forms land in the .sc parsers.
