# ⭐ RUNG 2 STEP 1 of frame-slot-reuse-a-live-range-in-a-byrd-graph-extends-to-every-point-reachable-by-recession
# (cto, CEO-684 slice 2): THE DET-LEAF FACT TRAVELS ON THE IR NODE.  A CALL is beta-capable until proven otherwise;
# the proof for a $-leaf is per callee: the emitter's registry (dop_direct_fp, bb_call.cpp) names the C functions a
# call reaches directly, every such box returns once and its beta is a jump to omega (bb_call_fn.cpp, both arms),
# and its argv block is read only by that one call.  The LOWERER asks the registry at graph finish (pl_graph_stamp)
# and seals the node (IR_t.seal = IR_SEAL_CALL_DET_LEAF, the call's existing lowerer-fact field, language-blind
# name in IR.h); the EMITTER refuses (x86_bomb) any sealed call its registry does not know; the reuse relation
# reads only the seal and stops calling a sealed call a choice point (PINNED det leaf <name>: no beta, argv dead
# at gamma), so a straight temp that merely spans a det leaf is no longer PINNED guard.  Result and argv slots
# do not move in this step (the argv rung is next); this step lands the CLAIM, printed, and the check that holds it.
# THE CLAIM SPANS TWO SITES (the lowerer's seal, the emitter's registry), so util_frame_det_leaf_bit_vs_registry.py
# grades every graph of the Prolog witness: sealed calls in --dump-zeta == IR_CALL boxes whose first call
# instruction targets a registry symbol rather than rt_call_arr_bl (by-name dispatch), both directions.
# PINS: (1) every graph graded and every graph agrees; (2) r/1 seals exactly its five $-leaves and its guard pin
# is gone (guard=0 in the summary; rung 1 read guard=1 across $ax_sub); (3) the Icon silent-failure witness
# (every write(1, 1 to 3)) still reads PINNED guard naming IR_TO -- a generator is not a det leaf; (4) the
# MEASURES line.  RED-BEFORE (5538c5a5e): no det-leaf line anywhere (sealed=0 on 161 graphs against 486 direct
# boxes), r/1 guard=1.
