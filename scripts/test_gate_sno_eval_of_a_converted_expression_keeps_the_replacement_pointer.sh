#
# THE CLASS, and it is a register-plane invariant, not a pattern bug. r12 is THE CAS POINTER -- the pending-
# replacement stack that bb_match_end stores the replacement length through. Generated code treats it as a
# MACHINE-WIDE INVARIANT established exactly once, in the program's own prologue (mode 4 emits
# `mov r12, qword ptr [0x70000000]` into main; mode 3 does the same two instructions in icn_zf_main_call).
# ⛔ BUT INSIDE THE C RUNTIME r12 IS AN ORDINARY CALLEE-SAVED REGISTER, so any C function may keep its own
# value there. The two trampolines that enter a compiled chain FROM C -- rt_chain_enter and rt_chain_enter_v
# in src/runtime/runtime_eval.c -- push and pop r12 correctly for their own caller, and used to jump into
# generated code WITHOUT re-establishing it. So the chain ran with C's r12 (measured: 0x68, a 104) and the
# first `subject pattern = replacement` inside it stored through it and SIGSEGV'd.
#
# ⭐ WHY THIS WITNESS AND NOT A PATTERN ONE. The corrupt pointer is carried by EVERY chain entered from C;
# only a statement that performs a REPLACEMENT ever dereferences it. Everything else runs correctly over the
# same corruption, which is why the class hid inside one vendor program for so long: the two aisnobol entries
# that crashed were the only ones whose loaded library body reached a successful replacement.
#
# THE ARMS. Arm 1 is the witness: EVAL of a CONVERT'd EXPRESSION reaching a function that performs a
# replacement. Arms 2 and 3 are the CONTROL PAIR, and they are not decoration -- each is one ingredient
# removed from arm 1 (EVAL of a plain STRING; the same function called directly), each PASSED before the cure,
# and a "cure" that seeded r12 wrongly or unconditionally would red them while arm 1 went green. One arm alone
# is passed by over-correcting.
#
# Every arm compares against the ORACLE's own output, in BOTH modes, with refs cut from it on this run -- and
# the oracle is run TWICE and diffed against ITSELF first, refusing rc=2 if it differs
# (FINDING-2026-09-13-hq_S-a-done-when-that-byte-compares-a-program-printing-a-clock-reading-is-unsatisfiable).
