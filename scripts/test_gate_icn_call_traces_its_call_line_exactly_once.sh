#!/usr/bin/env bash
# test_gate_icn_call_traces_its_call_line_exactly_once.sh -- one call, one TRK_CALL event, one bar depth.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (hq_B found it 2026-09-10 while curing the Icon trace value renderer; hq_U cured it):
# a procedure call of arity FIVE OR MORE printed its trace call line TWICE and left the bar depth one too
# high for the rest of the call -- every later line, including "f returned", inherited the extra bar.
# THE BODY RAN ONCE: it was a duplicated EVENT, not a duplicated call.
#
# THE INVARIANT THIS PINS is ownership of the call event, and it is one predicate at the SHARED call spine
# rt_proc_call_prologue_lex (src/runtime/rt/rt.c): the spine computed `own` as "the callee has a registered
# direct-call fn and is not a generator", opened a level with it, and emitted the TRK_CALL itself when NOT
# own -- i.e. it assumed an UNREGISTERED callee has no tap of its own. The callee's compiled prologue tap
# (xa_icn_trace_tap kind==1 -> rt_trace_call_hook_f) emits UNCONDITIONALLY, so any callee routing through
# the spine with no dc_fn registered fired both taps and opened both levels. The cure makes a NON-GENERATOR
# callee always own its own call event, which is what the arity 1-4 route already did by never reaching the
# spine at all. THE GENERATOR ARM IS UNCHANGED ON PURPOSE and is not incidental: forcing own=1 for
# generators too was measured and took test_gate_icn_generator_exhaustion_traces_failed from 10/10 to 2
# FAILs, because a generator's events are owned by the spine, not by its prologue.
#
# ⛔ THE ARITY BOUNDARY IS THE WHOLE POINT, so this gate walks 1..8 rather than sampling. Arities 1-4 were
# ALREADY GREEN before the cure and are kept as ORACLE-AGREEMENT arms, not detectors: they would catch a
# future cure that overshoots into suppressing the event on the direct route. MEASURED on the pre-cure
# binary, 5/6/7/8 go RED in both modes and 1/2/3/4 do not -- so 8 of the 16 arms discriminate and the gate
# says so rather than printing a denominator that reads as if all 16 did.
#
# ⛔ &trace WRITES ONLY TO stderr, so every run below captures 2>&1; a version that dropped stderr would
# score a green board over an empty file.
