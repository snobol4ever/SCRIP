# ⛔ NEW RED BISECTED TO THE SLOT-REUSE ROW'S RUNG 1 (hq_prolog, 2026-09-16, two fresh builds: e83244874 good,
# d21da7354 red): the SWI package board lost nine m3 cases in core/test_hash.pl -- the whole plunit unit yielded
# NO verdict under m3 while m4 answered.  MEASURED: m3 aborts inside the unit with FATAL drive_value_slot on an
# IR_VAR_FRAME of the run-time-defined predicate $mc:variant_sha1/2 (nodes=14) -- and the layout's record for
# that graph POINTER already existed from a DEAD graph (37 slots, 23 results, region 640, gdb-read), so
# zls_build() returned early ("already built") right after zls_forget_graph_nodes() had dropped the nodes'
# entries: no node had a grant.  The defect predates rung 1 (a graph record keyed by pointer survived the
# graph's death); rung 1's malloc/free of the reuse plan changed the allocation pattern that recycles the address.
# CURE: zls_forget_graph_nodes() retires the graph's record as well as its nodes (frame_layout.c), and the
# runtime-eval define path forgets before it drives, exactly as lower_prolog's does (runtime_eval.c).
# ⛔ THE WITNESS IS ONE CORPUS PROGRAM RUN AS A WITNESS, NOT A BOARD: the shape needs the file's exact
# allocation history (the variant_sha1 unit alone does not recycle the address), so this gate runs
# swi_tests/core/test_hash.pl under the SWI runner's exact m3 invocation and grades it with the runner's own
# matcher against the file's swipl ref; it writes no row.  PINS: (1) no FATAL on stderr; (2) the m3 verdict
# count equals the m4 verdict count on the same binary (20 and 20 today: 9 agree, 11 disagree, both modes);
# (3) under SCRIP_PL_RTASM=1 no run-time fragment reports max_granted_cell=-1 with nodes>0.
# RED-BEFORE (888f9a767): m3 rc=134, FATAL drive_value_slot op=133, m3 verdicts 0 of 20, RTASM
# "$mc:variant_sha1/2: nodes=14 ... max_granted_cell=-1".
