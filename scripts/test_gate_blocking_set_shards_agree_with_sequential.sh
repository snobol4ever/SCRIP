# test_gate_blocking_set_shards_agree_with_sequential.sh -- A SHARDED RUN REDS THE SAME NAME SET AS A SEQUENTIAL ONE
# (coo 2026-09-17, ceo CEO-829, from the cfo's economy measurement; row instrument-the-blocking-set-shards-and-a-
# sharded-run-reds-the-same-name-set-as-a-sequential-one).
#
# WHY THE ACCEPTANCE IS NOT A SPEEDUP.  The 338-arm set costs about 35 minutes while origin/main took 22 landings
# today -- and the gaps between the last twelve ran 0,2,2,9,4,0,3,3,322,1,3,49 minutes, so the average hides the
# shape: landings arrive in BURSTS and a 35-minute set cannot fit inside one at all.  Sharding is the obvious
# answer and the obvious answer is where the lie gets in: a fan-out changes the box's load, the working directory
# two arms share, and whether two boards run at once.  So the gate does not ask "was it faster".  It asks whether
# the RED NAME SET and the REFUSED NAME SET are the same ones (CEO-825 clause 1: two readings can agree on a count
# and disagree on membership).  An arm whose verdict changes with HOW it was run is THE FINDING.
#
#   (a) PARTITION, over the REAL 337-arm declaration and without running one of them: every shard's arms plus the
#       declared serial arms reconstruct the declaration EXACTLY ONCE -- nothing doubled, nothing dropped
#   (b) NAME-SET IDENTITY, on a fixture set that really runs: sequential vs --shards 3, same red names, same
#       refused names, same green count, same total
#   (c) A DECLARED SERIAL ARM IS IN NO SHARD and is still RUN by the fan-out -- excluded from the slice, not from
#       the set, which is the difference between a hazard and a hole
#   (d) REPORTED arms (leading -) do not change a sharded verdict, exactly as they do not change a sequential one
#   (e) a shard that would hold ZERO arms REFUSES rc=2 rather than printing the success shape
#   (f) the fan-out REFUSES rc=2 if its merged arm count does not equal the declared one -- a set that cannot
#       account for its own arms is not a measurement
# FAIL_ONCE=1 corrupts the fixture's sequential reading before (b) asserts, to prove the arm trips.
