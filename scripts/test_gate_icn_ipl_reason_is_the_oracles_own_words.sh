# THE DEFECT THIS PINS. util_cut_icon_ipl_refs.sh wrote ONE composed sentence onto every row its rc!=0
# arm produced -- "needs argv/stdin this driver does not supply, or genuine rejection" -- and that
# sentence reached 212 rows of corpus/packages/icon/ipl/UNGRADED.tsv, the file that says WHAT IS OWED.
# Measured against the oracle, those 212 are four different answers: 102 programs whose link closure
# never resolved an identifier (this oracle is built WITHOUT graphics, so gprogs/ reaches WOpen,
# WAttrib, DrawLine, DrawPoint, Fg ... unresolved) and which then died calling one; 6 that want a tty;
# 34 that print their own usage banner; and the remainder, which are none of those. ⭐ A COMPOUND
# REASON CANNOT BE FALSIFIED BY ANY SINGLE OBSERVATION, so it is never corrected: "argv OR stdin OR a
# genuine rejection" is true of almost any failing program, which is exactly why it survived 212 rows.
# It is the untestable form of "I did not look".
#
# ⛔ AND THE ROWS ARE NOT COSMETIC. UNGRADED.tsv is work OWED and claimable; UNGRADABLE.tsv is a ruling
# nobody owes work on (lib_inventory.sh's own split). Filing a program that cannot run on this oracle at
# all as "needs argv" mints a row NO LANE CAN EVER CLOSE, and buries the genuinely curable argv rows
# among them -- the identical harm DISPLAY_REFUSED was split out of ORACLE_FAIL to prevent, recurring
# one arm lower down the same if-chain.
#
# NINE ARMS. 3 and 4 run the real cutter end to end against a scratch package (S4E_HOME redirection),
# never a re-implementation of its predicate -- a copied classifier is a classifier that drifts.
