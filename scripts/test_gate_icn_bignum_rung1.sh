# Icon large integers, RUNG 1: the shapes rung 0 deliberately did not cover. Row
# icon-bignum-rung-1-division-remainder-literals-conversion-and-negation.
#
# Measured 2026-09-06 against iconx, on the tree where rung 0 is already green:
#   2^100 / 2^90   iconx 1024                                   SCRIP 1
#   2^100 % 7      iconx 2                                      SCRIP 0
#   2^100 / 3      iconx 422550200076076467165567735125         SCRIP 3074457345618258602
#   12345678901234567890 + 1                                    ⛔ THE LEXER, NOT THE RUNTIME: iconx
#                  prints 12345678901234567891, SCRIP prints 9.223372037e+18 -- an integer literal too
#                  wide for int64 becomes a REAL at parse time, so NO runtime cure can reach it and a
#                  witness built on a large literal tests the lexer rather than the arithmetic.
#   integer("1267650600228229401496703205376")  iconx echoes it; SCRIP clamps to INT64_MAX
#   -(2^100)       iconx -1267650600228229401496703205376; SCRIP -9223372036854775807 (unary minus has
#                  no large-integer arm)
#
# ⭐ TWO ARMS ARE ALREADY GREEN AND ARE KEPT AS CONTROLS, not removed: real(2^100) and 2^100 - 2^100.
# An arm that is green before the cure proves nothing about the cure DIRECTION, which is exactly why
# they are labelled controls here rather than counted as witnesses -- they exist to catch a rung-1 cure
# that breaks what rung 0 already got right.
# ⛔ REFUSES rc=2 unless all 16 runs (8 witnesses x 2 modes) are graded, and rc=2 if the oracle is absent.
