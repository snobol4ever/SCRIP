# test_gate_raku_the_test_module_exits_as_rakudos_does_when_the_plan_is_not_met_or_a_test_fails.sh -- A TAP FILE THAT RAN FEWER TESTS THAN IT PLANNED IS NOT A PASS
# (row raku-every-suite-to-100-under-nonet-ceo-1266; ceo CEO-1479). FOUND by the sanctioned Roast inventory plus a per-file TAP count: of the 199 files the
# scoreboard classified PASS, only 41 had run every planned test. The Test emulation (by_name_dispatch.c __rk_test_*) printed the plan and left the exit status 0
# however few tests ran, so a file whose assertions were lost (a failing match as an argument killed the whole call, an unimplemented function ended the run)
# read as a green file; classify() in lib_raku_roast_bucket.sh grades PASS on no not-ok line and rc 0 with a plan. Rakudo's Test sets the status in its END phase:
# the number of failed tests when any failed (capped at 254), else 255 when the planned count differs from the run count, else 0, and prints
# "# You planned N tests, but ran M" and "# You failed K tests of M" on stderr. rk_tap_exit (by_name_dispatch.c, registered at the plan and the first test, run at exit
# with the stack re-aligned because the emitted program's exit call enters libc at 8 mod 16) does the same.
# NINE PROGRAMS, each run in m3 and m4, stdout and the exit status compared with Rakudo's (cut by Rakudo at generation):
# under-run, over-run, an over-run with a failure, all green, a failure within the plan, done-testing without a plan, done-testing with a failure, an over-run with no
# failure, an under-run with a failure.
# EXPECTED to move: the Roast SUITE TABLE reading falls to the true count when the coo's next pass runs (the 158 files that never ran their tests leave PASS).
# EXIT: 0 all nine agree in both modes; 1 a stdout or status mismatch; 2 REFUSED (stale binary, no gcc).
# Usage: bash scripts/test_gate_raku_the_test_module_exits_as_rakudos_does_when_the_plan_is_not_met_or_a_test_fails.sh   (~5s)
