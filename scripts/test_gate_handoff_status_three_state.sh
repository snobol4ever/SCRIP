# (handoff_status.sh three-state verdict + BEHIND/UNPUSHED/DIVERGED split).
#
# Builds real scratch git repos (bare "remote" + local clone) on disk under a tmpdir for EACH
# state and calls handoff_status.sh with EXPLICIT repo args pointing at them — never adds a repo
# under a seat root (tasks/handoff-status-three-state-push-check.task.md NEXT §5: "a stray clone
# becomes a permanent handoff blocker the moment it takes a local commit"). Also exercises the
# auto-discovery "nothing to examine" path by invoking a throwaway copy of the script from an
# empty scratch workspace. Nothing here touches the real workspace, postoffice, or any seat root.
