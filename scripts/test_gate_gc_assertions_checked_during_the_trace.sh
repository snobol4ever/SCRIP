# test_gate_gc_assertions_checked_during_the_trace.sh -- GC ASSERTIONS ARE CHECKED DURING THE TRACE THE COLLECTOR ALREADY DOES
# (row gc-assertions-are-checked-during-the-trace-piggybacked-on-work-the-collector-already-does, the cfo, 2026-09-28; Aftandilian
# and Guyer, GC Assertions, PLDI 2009; Reichenbach et al. 2010 for which assertions are cheap in one traversal; hq_pascal read both
# papers and classified the candidates on 2026-09-21; the cto's ruling of 2026-09-22: an assertion REPORTS, it never aborts by
# default, because an aborting assertion turns every wrong-answer red in nine lanes into a crash and voids their evidence).
#
# THE MECHANISM (src/runtime/rt/gc_heap.c, gc_heap.h): an assertion is not checked when it is made; it conveys intent to the
# collector, which checks it right after its mark phase, when every live block carries HBF_MARK.  No new static: the intent rides
# the heap itself.
#   rt_gc_assert_dead(payload)          sets HBF_ASSERT_DEAD in the block's own header; a marked block carrying it is reported
#                                       "[ZGC-ASSERT] DEAD-ASSERTED ... is REACHABLE" at every collection that finds it live.
#   rt_gc_assert_instances(kind, n)     returns a two-DESCR vector {kind, n} flagged HBF_ASSERT_INST; the caller keeps it reachable,
#                                       and at each collection that marks it the collector counts the marked blocks of that kind
#                                       and reports "[ZGC-ASSERT] INSTANCES kind=... expected n live, the trace found m" on a mismatch.
# The check is one pass over the block index per collection (a flag test per block), a second pass only when an assertion is live.
# SCRIP_GC_ASSERT_FATAL=1 aborts after reporting; unset, the program runs on.  Root-set completeness is NOT here: it is not a
# one-traversal property (Reichenbach section 4) and stays with the conservative auditor.
#
# THE FIXTURE is a C program linked on libscrip_rt.so.  It roots blocks through the one C-reachable root form the collector walks,
# rt_gc_root_range_add_topword: a buffer whose word at +0 is its top, +8 is the Prolog trail's ball slot (kept zero), and each
# 32-byte entry from +32 holds a raw cell the collector visits and a DESCR it visits.
#
# ARMS: (1) DEAD, VIOLATED: a rooted block asserted dead is reported by kind at the next collection and the program exits 0;
# (2) DEAD, HONOURED: an unrooted block asserted dead draws no report; (3) INSTANCES, HOLDING: three rooted blocks of one kind and
# an assertion of three draw no report; (4) INSTANCES, VIOLATED: the same blocks and an assertion of four are reported with the
# count the trace found; (5) FATAL: arm (1) under SCRIP_GC_ASSERT_FATAL=1 reports and then aborts (rc 134).  Arms (1) and (2)
# together prove the fixture's root form works: the only difference between them is the root.
