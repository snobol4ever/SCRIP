# test_gate_progress_records_the_configuration_it_exercised.sh -- THE PROGRESS DATABASE RECORDS WHAT THE BOARD
# EXERCISED, AND ITS HEADER NAMES EVERY COLUMN IT WRITES (coo 2026-09-21; ceo rank 0 at CEO-1047 and CEO-1050:
# "every clause of the batch I just landed requires a board to say what it EXERCISED, and the database is where
# that is supposed to survive the sitting ... the DB has no column for ARENA or STRESS, so three runs of one
# suite on one tree are distinguishable only by timestamp").
#
# ⛔⭐ THE MEASUREMENT THAT MINTED THIS GATE, live table, 2026-09-21: 2934 duplicate (tree, corpus, suite,
# program, mode) keys in one day; SEVEN byte-identical rows for snocone break_any_pos_replace_1 m3 inside five
# minutes, appended by a gate arm whose own name ends "under_forced_collection"; and 139 keys since 09-20 where
# ONE tree and ONE corpus carry CONTRADICTORY outcomes -- raku-master token_say_4 m3 reads both PASS and FAIL at
# the CLEAN tree 5418432bb. Under a byte-for-byte oracle diff that is impossible unless something unrecorded
# changed, and the unrecorded thing is the configuration. util_progress_flips.py keys on (suite, program, mode)
# and so resolves every one of those collisions BY ARRIVAL ORDER: the divergence the whole fleet is hunting is
# invisible to the measure by construction.
#
# ⛔⭐ AND THE HALF THAT EXPLAINS WHY NOBODY SAW IT, WHICH IS A DEFECT IN A SIBLING GATE'S SHAPE RATHER THAN IN
# ITS ARMS: test_gate_progress_append_writes_a_row.sh asserts the writer emits 13 fields and is GREEN -- against
# a table it creates fresh under mktemp, where the header is written complete on first touch. The LIVE table has
# existed since 2026-09-06 and its header is the ORIGINAL TWELVE. So `fingerprint`, added as column 13, has been
# written into every row since and is UNREACHABLE BY NAME to every csv.DictReader in the fleet -- it lands in
# csv's unnamed restkey and is silently dropped. A hermetic gate that constructs its subject fresh cannot see a
# defect that exists only in the long-lived artefact. EVERY ARM BELOW THEREFORE RUNS AGAINST A PRE-EXISTING
# TABLE CARRYING AN OLDER HEADER, which is the shape the live table actually has.
#
#   1  a column the writer writes is NAMED by the header of a table that already existed (no unnamed restkey)
#   2  the writer REFUSES rc=2 to record a row that declares no configuration while a GC axis is set in its env
#   3  a declared configuration reaches the column and reads back BY NAME through csv.DictReader
#   4  the reader keys on the configuration: two configurations of one program do not overwrite one another
#   5  the reader NAMES a same-tree same-configuration contradiction instead of resolving it by arrival order
#   7  THE RUNNER DECLARES: corpus_suite_harness.py states the axis it ran under, at BOTH ends of the axis
#   6  SEAM/CONTROL: with no axis set and nothing declared the append is ACCEPTED and reads `undeclared` --
#      the writer guesses `shipped` for nobody (CEO-812's principle applied to the record instead of the heap)
#
# Hermetic: S4E_PROGRESS_DB points every arm at a scratch table under mktemp and the live table is never touched.
# No binary is run and no corpus is read, so this gate is cheap; it is wired BLOCKING in `make test` and NOT in
# `make preflight` (CEO-1046: a hermetic gate that reads a live external tree is not hermetic).
# Cost: ~4 s (arm 7 runs a real one-entry suite, so this gate needs the built binary and refuses rc=2 without it).
#
# PROVEN RED BEFORE THE CURE (CEO-1049), on 27630286a, 2026-09-21: arms 1,2,3,4,5 RED, arm 6 red on the value
# (`` rather than `undeclared`). Receipt in the row's baton and in GOAL-COO.md COO-130.
