# test_gate_gate_wiring_ratchet.sh — the invariant gate over scripts/util_gate_wiring.py, THE RATCHET that
# keeps a gate from landing on disk and being run by nothing (row requested by hq_S 2026-09-06, routed by the
# ceo as CEO-326; built by hq_T).
#
# WHAT IT PROTECTS. hq_S's measured case: test_gate_sno_fence_body_dynamic_operand.sh landed IN THE SAME PUSH
# as the cure it grades and was never added to the recipe, so for a day the one instrument that could grade
# that cure was run by nothing. ⛔ AND NOTHING COULD HAVE NOTICED — the gate was green by hand, ls found it,
# the commit looked complete, and every board was byte-identical with and without the cure BY CONSTRUCTION, so
# no suite could miss it either. An unwired gate is indistinguishable from a wired one by every check except
# reading the recipe. util_gate_wiring.py is that check; this gate is what keeps IT honest.
#
# ⛔ IT GRADES THE INSTRUMENT ON FIXTURES, NOT THE LIVE TREE, AND THAT IS THE POINT. The live check belongs in
# handoff_status.sh (hq_S's placement argument, and it is the half that would not have been got right alone:
# handoff is the moment a seat asks "is there anything I owe", whereas a recipe check fires every seat's
# `make test` for everybody else's debt). What belongs HERE is the proof that the instrument's REFUSALS still
# fire — because the failure this whole family is about is an instrument that looks like it is measuring.
#
# ⭐ EVERY ARM IS A FAIL-ONCE PROOF. Each fixture is built so that exactly one refusal can fire, and the arm
# asserts the refusal NAMES the gate it is about. A ratchet that says "the floor moved" sends its reader to
# diff two files by hand, and the reader who has to do that is the reader who mutes the check (hq_S). The two
# arms that carry the design are:
#   · the COUNT-UNCHANGED REGRESSION — one WIRED name leaves and another arrives in the same edit, so the
#     count is identical and a count-only floor is GREEN OVER A REAL REGRESSION. The name set still refuses.
#   · REACHABILITY IS EXECUTION, NOT MENTION — a gate named only in a comment, only in an echo, or only inside
#     a glob-census that READS the files is NOT reachable, and counting it would be the instrument lying in
#     the comfortable direction (under-reporting debt is exactly the direction nobody would notice).
#
# ⛔ AND IT ASSERTS THE LIVE FILE IS SANE without grading it: the population must cover scripts/test_gate_*.sh
# exactly once, or `check`'s SUM arm is asserting over a file that cannot be right. That is a shape check on
# the record, not a verdict on the debt — the debt is handoff_status.sh's to report and nobody's to be blocked
# by here.
