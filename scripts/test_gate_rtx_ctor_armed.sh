# test_gate_rtx_ctor_armed.sh — RTX_GATE family armed-state IS observable, and a build that
# drops rtx_gates_init() (the static-archive constructor trap, FINDING-2026-08-22-seat01-
# kill-the-plt-measured-real-but-tiny-and-a-static-archive-constructor-trap.md §5) FAILS this
# gate instead of silently shipping ~14 disarmed fast-path families at 2.05x cost, correct
# output, zero error. Queue row `rung-static-archive-ctor-drop`.
#
# THREE ARMS, not two — a negative test that cannot demonstrate its own negative is worthless
# (same philosophy as test_gate_rtx_killswitch_sets.sh's QUARANTINE verdict: report the fact,
# never assume it). NOTE ON ARM A: the gate bytes are DELIBERATELY `.hidden` (rtx_abi.inc:71-76
# — "scrip links dynamically against libscrip_rt.so, so hidden visibility makes [rip+sym]
# direct and interposition-proof"), which means they are NOT in the .so's dynamic symbol table
# and an externally-linked probe cannot `extern`+dynamically-link against out/libscrip_rt.so to
# read them (verified: that link fails with "undefined reference", not a runtime answer). A
# PLAIN multi-object static link (object files listed directly, never through an archive) is
# not blocked by hidden visibility (that only suppresses DYNAMIC/shared-library export) and
# is not subject to the archive-pull hazard either (every listed .o is unconditionally
# included, unlike archive members) — so it is the correct, meaningful control for "nothing is
# artificially excluding rtx_init.o", verified separately from the shipped .so.
#   A — CONTROL: probe linked against out/rt_pic/*.o directly, as a plain object list (no
#       archive). Every listed .o, including rtx_init.o, is unconditionally pulled in exactly
#       like it is inside out/libscrip_rt.so's own link line (Makefile:353) — this is the
#       object-inclusion half of what makes today's actual .so safe, checked the one way this
#       probe can check it. (The .so's OWN safety additionally rests on ELF shared-object
#       constructors running unconditionally at load time regardless of symbol references —
#       basic dynamic-loader behavior, not specific to this codebase, not re-verified here.)
#       MUST read ARMED (rc=0).
#   B — the trap, reproduced for real: probe linked against a NAIVE `ar rcs` static archive
#       of the exact same objects. Archive members are pulled only to satisfy undefined
#       symbol references; nothing references anything inside rtx_init.o (the constructor is
#       registered via .init_array, not called by name), so it is silently dropped and every
#       gate byte stays at its `.byte 0` link-time default. MUST read DISARMED (rc=1) — if
#       this arm reads ARMED instead, the gate FAILS LOUDLY: it would mean the probe cannot
#       actually detect the hazard it exists to catch, which is worse than not having it.
#   C — the known-good fix (seat01 arm C2): the same static archive, linked with
#       `-Wl,--whole-archive` so every member (rtx_init.o included) is forced in. MUST read
#       ARMED (rc=0) — documents, verified, the one thing that fixes arm B if static linking
#       is ever actually adopted.
#
# GATE PASSES iff A=ARMED and B=DISARMED and C=ARMED. Any other combination is a FAIL with the
# offending arm named — never a silent partial pass.
