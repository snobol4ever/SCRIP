# test_gate_sno_repl_lvalue_subject.sh -- SN4-REPL slice 2: a pattern-replacement SUBJECT may be a
# subscript or an indirect lvalue, not only a plain variable. Until SCRIP d5d63c9d3 the lowerer
# REFUSED these at compile time ("replacement subject must be a plain variable"), so a program using
# the form did not run at all; eliza-duquet-original and eliza-modernized both ride it.
#
# THE THREE SHAPE ARMS are the obvious half:
#   (1) array element   A<1> 'WORLD' = 'THERE'
#   (2) indirect        $N   'WORLD' = 'THERE'
#   (3) table element   T<'k'> 'WORLD' = 'THERE'
#
# ⭐ THE TWO ARMS THAT ACTUALLY EARN THIS GATE ARE (4) AND (5), because NO FIXTURE IN THE SNOFLAKE
# SUITE WOULD CATCH EITHER -- the eliza pair passes whether or not they hold, so without this gate the
# desugaring could regress into a plausible-looking cure and every board would stay green:
#   (4) A FAILED MATCH MUST NOT WRITE. The write-back sits on the success path; move it and
#       `A<1> 'ZZZ' = 'THERE' :F(...)` starts clobbering A<1> with the replacement on a match that
#       never happened.
#   (5) THE SUBJECT LVALUE IS EVALUATED EXACTLY ONCE. The cure saves the lvalue into a hidden name
#       ahead of the match; the obvious alternative -- re-lowering the subject for the write-back --
#       evaluates the subscript TWICE, which is invisible until the index has a side effect. The arm
#       counts calls to a counting function used as the index.
#
# EVERY ARM IS GRADED AGAINST sbl -bf IN THE SAME RUN rather than a recorded .ref, in both modes,
# because the claim is oracle agreement and not a remembered stream. The oracle comes from
# lib_oracle_flags.sh, never a hand-built path.
