# CEO-1002, on Lon's rule that when a seat fails to do a thing the system never asked them to do, the row is
# against the SYSTEM -- a ruling that converts a structural gap into an instruction is obeyed for a week).
# THE ASYMMETRY BEING CURED: the bus VERIFIED THE EXIT and TRUSTED THE ENTRY. SIX WHEEL-SPINS IN ONE DAY,
# 2026-09-20, every one a premise that was cheap to check and that nothing made anyone check: a 51-entry
# taxonomy withdrawn because the allocator never collects; a trail mark banked against an empty trail; a cure
# announced for a raw push a watchpoint then proved dead; effort inferred from `ps`; a row opened on a premise
# red in every SnoM run; an eight-program bisect with three claims false on this tree.
# ⛔ A RED PREMISE IS NOT A DEFECT. It is the row needing REWRITING before an hour goes into it -- so the
# refusal must not lock, must not serve, must name the premise, and must say which of those two things it is.
# TEN ARMS against a THROWAWAY postoffice under mktemp -- never the live one:
#   (1) STALE-REFUSES   a red PREMISE-WHEN refuses `claim`: NO claim file, column still FREE, nonzero rc.
#   (2) NAMES-IT        that refusal PRINTS the failing premise text and what the premise itself said. A
#                       refusal that does not name the premise sends the seat to debug their own tree.
#   (3) LIVE-ADMITS     a green PREMISE-WHEN locks exactly as before -- the gate must not cost a good row.
#   (4) ABSENT-ADMITS   a baton with NO PREMISE-WHEN still locks (⛔ 1100+ live batons predate the field; a
#                       gate that blocked them would stop the fleet) -- and says so, so nothing reads an
#                       unasked question as a verified answer.
#   (5) NOOP-NOT-VERIFIED  `PREMISE-WHEN: true` locks but must NOT report a verified premise. The vacuous
#                       criterion is the entry-side form of the false green this fleet keeps paying for.
#   (6) ASSIGNED-GATED  ⛔ THE PATH THAT MATTERS MOST. An ASSIGNED row never passes through `claim` (the HQ
#                       wrote the lock), so a cure wired only into `claim` leaves the fleet's COMMONEST
#                       dispatch unchecked. `next` must refuse to flip ASSIGNED->RUNNING on a red premise.
#   (7) NEXT-NOT-SILENT `next` over a FREE red-premise row prints the refusal and leaves the row FREE. The
#                       picker captures the inner claim's streams, so a refusal raised there can die unseen.
#   (8) OVERRIDE-LOUD   S4E_PREMISE_OVERRIDE takes the lock, says so, and writes the reason into the baton.
#                       An escape hatch that leaves no receipt is indistinguishable from the hole it replaces.
#   (9) WHOLE-FIELD     a multi-line PREMISE-WHEN is read WHOLE. The truncation class that ate DONE-WHENs
#                       (a heredoc opener alone exits 0 having run nothing) must not be re-imported here.
#  (10) NOT-SWALLOWED   a multi-line DONE-WHEN followed by PREMISE-WHEN must NOT absorb it -- otherwise the
#                       premise runs as part of the completion test and the two contracts merge silently.
# FAIL-ONCE: five mutants -- M1 unwires claim's gate (arm 1 red), M2 unwires the ASSIGNED path only (arm 6
# red, the half-wired shape), M3 blinds the gate to always-admit (arms 1/6/7 red), M4 drops PREMISE-WHEN from
# the extractor's terminator set (arm 10 red), M5 truncates the premise to one line (arm 9 red).
# EXIT 0 all arms hold and all five mutants go red; 1 otherwise; 2 REFUSED (fixture unbuildable).
