# bench_icon_kernels.sh -- THE TEN ICON KERNELS, re-measured on the TWO-NUMBER BASIS against BOTH
# rivals: Arizona iconx (the reference implementation) and JCON jcont (Proebsting & Townsend's
# Icon-to-JVM compiler).  Written hq_P 2026-09-10 for ceo CEO-490, on Lon's question of 2026-09-10
# 09:1x, verbatim: "How does the speed of SCRIP compare to Arizona and JCON?"
#
# ⛔⭐⭐ WHAT THIS REPLACES, AND WHY THE OLD GRID COULD NOT SIMPLY BE RE-RUN.  README.md § Icon
# carried a ten-kernel `x vs iconx` grid (int_loop 5.64x ... concat_intvar 0.72x) dated 2026-08-27,
# measured on WHOLE-PROGRAM WALL CLOCK with no overhead term and no rival but Arizona.  Every one of
# those three properties is now a defect: the kernels run in 20-500 ms, /usr/bin/time resolves 10 ms,
# and process start is 1-4 ms for a native engine and ~70 ms for a JVM -- so a bare wall total on this
# set is a small number of ticks with a start-up constant baked into it, and the constant is 5% of one
# engine's reading and 50% of another's.  ⛔ A SINGLE-INSTRUMENT WALL GRID CANNOT BE FIXED BY RUNNING
# IT AGAIN; it has to be replaced by an instrument with no floor plus a basis that names the constant.
#
# ⭐⭐ TWO INSTRUMENTS, AND NO MULTIPLE EVER CROSSES THEM (RULES.md § FACT RULES, APPLES TO APPLES).
#   [A] callgrind Ir -- for iconx, m3 and m4.  DETERMINISTIC, and MEASURED HERE 2026-09-10 rather than
#       assumed, because the first draft of this header overclaimed it and the board caught the draft:
#         - SAME binary, SAME argv, SAME cwd, SAME environment, three runs -> 1,500,319,412 EXACTLY,
#           three times.  Byte-identical.  So ONE rep is the whole measurement, there is no spread to
#           report, and there is no tick floor to quantize against.
#         - CHANGE the path length or add an environment variable and it moves by ~1,000 Ir out of
#           1.5e9 (0.00009%): +1,305 for a longer .icx name, +1,007 for one extra env var, because the
#           process copies argv and environ at start-up.  ⛔ SO "byte-identical ACROSS RUNS" IS TOO
#           STRONG A CLAIM and this file no longer makes it -- the honest one is "byte-identical for a
#           FIXED argv and environment, and stable to five decimal places otherwise".  Every engine in
#           one board run shares one working directory, so that residue is common to the whole board
#           and is some six orders of magnitude below any multiple printed on it.
#       ⭐ Set that 0.00009% beside the JVM's 35% and the choice of instrument makes itself.
#       This is the instrument the README itself queued this re-measurement for.
#   [B] WALL and CPU ms -- for ALL FOUR engines, because it is the ONLY instrument the JVM arm can be
#       graded on at all.  ⛔ callgrind Ir REFUSES for jcont (ceo CEO-494): the same kernel measured
#       1,069,787,424 then 1,443,104,013 Ir, a 35% spread from JIT decisions alone.
#   ⛔ So `m4 x vs iconx` is an Ir multiple, `m4 x vs jcont` is a WALL multiple, each column says which,
#   and the two are never combined into a ranking.
#
# ⭐ THE THREE ANGLES on instrument [B] (ARCH-BENCH-CAMPAIGN-README-TABLES.md § THREE-ANGLE
# TRIANGULATION), which is how a 20 ms program is timed honestly with a 10 ms tick:
#   Angle 1 -- TIME-mode    : fixed wall budget, COUNT completed runs -> runs/s.
#   Angle 2 -- ITER-mode    : fixed run count, total external CPU     -> runs/s.
#   Angle 3 -- WRAPPER      : /usr/bin/time per run, MEDIAN of REPS after WARMUP discarded -> ms.
#   ⭐ Angles 1 and 2 AGGREGATE MANY PROCESS RUNS, so the 10 ms tick is divided away by the run count
#   instead of being carried into the answer -- that is their whole purpose on a set this fast.
#   ⛔ CROSS-PROVE OR VOID: angle 1 and angle 2 runs/s must agree within TOL_PCT for an (engine,kernel)
#   or the cell is printed VOID.  Two angles that disagree are not averaged; they are refused.
#
# ⭐ THE TWO-NUMBER BASIS: OVERHEAD is the EMPTY ICON PROGRAM measured per engine on the SAME
# instrument; WORK = total - OVERHEAD.  ⛔ THE JVM's WARM-UP IS OVERHEAD AND IS NEVER COUNTED AS WORK
# (CEO-490).  ⛔ CEO-173: where OVERHEAD reaches 50% of an arm's reading the WORK multiple is REFUSED
# and the labelled TOTAL-basis multiple prints in its place -- never both, never a quiet asterisk.
# Measured here: empty-program wall is iconx 1 ms, m4 2 ms, m3 4 ms, jcont ~70 ms, so the refusal is
# not hypothetical on this set -- it fires on the JVM arm of every short kernel.
#
# ⛔⭐ THE 790x TRAP (carried from bench_icon_classic_set.sh because it is the one that bites here).
# callgrind does NOT follow exec into a child unless --trace-children=yes.  A jcon program is a
# /bin/sh wrapper that execs java, so an untraced reading of an empty Icon program is 367,008 Ir where
# the truth is 291,132,178.  ⭐ The number is not malformed or suspicious -- it is a small, plausible,
# correctly measured count OF THE WRONG PROCESS, and on a board asking "who does less work" it reads
# as the rival winning by three orders of magnitude.
#
# ⛔⭐⭐ AND HERE IS THE GUARD THAT DOES **NOT** WORK, MEASURED ON THIS BOARD 2026-09-10 -- A MAGNITUDE
# FLOOR.  The first cut of this script refused any empty-program Ir under 1,000,000 as "too small to be
# real".  It fired IMMEDIATELY, on Arizona iconx, whose empty program reads 316,437 Ir -- and iconx is
# a stripped ELF binary that forks NOTHING.  ⭐ The reading was correct and the guard was wrong: Arizona's
# interpreter start-up is genuinely ~10x leaner than our runtime's (m4 empty = 2,932,358 Ir), which is a
# real and interesting fact about the rival, not an instrument fault.  ⛔ A MAGNITUDE FLOOR CANNOT TELL A
# LEAN ENGINE FROM A MISREAD ENGINE, because the wrapper's wrong number (367,008) and the lean engine's
# right number (316,437) are THE SAME SIZE.  Had the floor been set below iconx it would have passed
# jcont's misread too -- there is no threshold that separates them, so the whole shape is unfixable.
# ✅ THE DISCRIMINATOR THAT WORKS IS A DIRECT TEST OF THE CAUSE, NOT A PROXY FOR IT: run the empty
# program under callgrind twice, once plain and once --trace-children=yes, and count the `refs:` lines.
# A process that forks reports MORE THAN ONE refs line, or a different total when children are traced.
# MEASURED: iconx 316,437 == 316,437 and one line; m4 2,932,358 == 2,932,358 and one line; jcont prints
# TWO refs lines (298,665 and 366,447).  ⛔ An engine that fails this probe has its Ir arm REFUSED
# outright -- never silently corrected by adding --trace-children, because for a JVM the traced number
# is not a fixed reading, it is a different wrong reading (the JIT spread of CEO-494 is still there).
#
# CORRECTNESS GATES THE NUMBER: every kernel's stdout is byte-compared against an iconx cut taken AT
# RUN TIME.  An engine that answers differently gets NO multiple.  A wrong answer is never a fast one.
#
# EXIT: 0 = board printed, 1 = a kernel was RED, 2 = REFUSED (nothing measurable).  ⛔ It never prints
# an empty or partial grid as though it were a result.

# ---------- instrument A: callgrind Ir (deterministic, one rep) ----------
# ⛔⭐⭐ AN Ir READING FROM A RUN THAT DIED IS REFUSED, AND THE REFUSAL PRINTS WITH ITS REASON --
# "not measured" and "measured and thrown away" must never look the same on a board.  MEASURED HERE
# 2026-09-10 on concat_table: the m4 binary runs CLEAN and CORRECT natively (answer 40000, rc=0) and
# SIGSEGVs under valgrind inside gc_zeta_frame (gc_heap.c:557), which our own handler then reclassifies
# as a stack overflow (rt_stack_overflow.c:21) and re-raises.  ⭐ callgrind STILL PRINTS AN Ir TOTAL for
# that run -- 330,078,095 one time and 330,079,909 the next -- so the trap is a number that LOOKS like
# every other cell on the board and is (a) from a crashed process and (b) NOT EVEN DETERMINISTIC, which
# is the one property the whole Ir instrument rests on.  ⛔ So a non-zero exit voids the reading: the
# cell prints REFUSED(rc=N), never a bare NA and never the number.  IR_RC carries the status out.
# ⛔ THE STATUS COMES OUT THROUGH STDOUT, NOT THROUGH A VARIABLE.  The first cut set a global IR_RC here
# and read it in the caller -- but the caller invokes this as v="$(ir_one ...)", and a COMMAND
# SUBSTITUTION IS A SUBSHELL: the assignment happened in a child and the parent never saw it, so every
# crashed arm read back as rc=0 with an empty value and printed a bare NA -- exactly the "not measured"
# vs "measured and refused" confusion this function exists to prevent.  It printed no warning either,
# because the warning was gated on the variable that could not survive.  ⭐ A status that has to cross a
# subshell boundary travels as OUTPUT or as the function's own EXIT CODE; a global does not travel.
