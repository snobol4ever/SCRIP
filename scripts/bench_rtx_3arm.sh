# scripts/bench_rtx_3arm.sh -- RTX-0e: THE THREE-ARM INTERLEAVED HARNESS.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (s209, and it retro-qualifies numbers already in the ladder)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Every RTX rung before this one graded itself with a TWO-arm A/B: SCRIP_RTX_<FAM>=1
# against SCRIP_RTX_<FAM>=0.  That control is NOT pristine C.  With the gate off,
# every call to a ported symbol still executes:
#
#       endbr64 ; cmp byte ptr [rip+rtx_gate_<fam>],0 ; je c_<sym>@plt ; jmp <C body>
#
# i.e. a gate compare, a TAKEN branch, and a PLT stub indirection -- on EVERY call --
# which a pristine-C build never pays.  Measured s209 on two programs: the OFF arm is
# 5.8% (func_call) and 7.8% (fibonacci) SLOWER than pristine C.  That bias is
#   (a) ONE-DIRECTIONAL: it always flatters the asm, never the C; and
#   (b) LARGER than the +/-3% null floor the ladder grades against.
# A rung reporting "1.07x" from a two-arm A/B may have measured nothing but its own
# kill-switch.  s209's RTX-4 slice 3 did exactly that: 1.066x two-arm, 1.007x vs pristine.
#
# WHAT THIS DOES DIFFERENTLY
#   Three arms, INTERLEAVED WITHIN EACH ROUND so they share the same thermal/scheduler
#   moment, round 1 discarded (hugepage + page-cache warmup), medians reported:
#     PRISTINE  a .so built with the port absent entirely   (the HONEST baseline)
#     OFF       the ported .so, gate 0                      (kill-switch fallback path)
#     ON        the ported .so, gate 1                      (the asm)
#   Arms are selected by LD_LIBRARY_PATH, so ONE scrip binary runs all three and the
#   only thing that varies is the runtime .so -- no recompile, no relink between arms.
#
# WHAT IT REPORTS AND WHY BOTH RATIOS MATTER
#   ON/PRISTINE  <- THE REAL ANSWER. This is what the rung actually bought.
#   ON/OFF       <- the LEGACY two-arm number, printed ONLY so a rung can see how much
#                   of its historical claim was the artifact.
#   OFF/PRISTINE <- the kill-switch tax itself. If this is ~1.00 the family's gate is
#                   cheap (cold symbol); if it is well under 1.00 the family is hot and
#                   any two-arm number for it is suspect.
#
# USAGE
#   scripts/bench_rtx_3arm.sh --fam CALL --pristine <dir> --rtx <dir> [-r N] prog.sno ...
#   Both dirs must contain a libscrip_rt.so.  Build them by stashing the port for the
#   pristine one; keep the source tree on the PORTED state afterwards.
#
# CAVEATS THAT MUST TRAVEL WITH ANY NUMBER THIS PRINTS
#   - Label every result with RT_OPT (default -O0; -O2 only if Lon directed it).
#   - Programs must be SELF-TIMED (they must print "ms: <n>"); process startup is
#     excluded on purpose, so these are window ratios, not wall-clock ratios.
#   - This box is noisy (s200 recorded a 1.340/2.497/2.606/0.510 spread on table_access).
#     Medians can separate cleanly while per-run RANGES still overlap -- the script
#     prints every raw sample so that overlap is visible rather than hidden.
#   - A ~1.00 ON/PRISTINE is THE ANSWER, not a failed measurement (s187/s204 rule).
#     State the expected band BEFORE running this.
