# audit_pascal_pat_owed_error_checks.sh -- the seat-side census of the PAT error checks still owed
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS AND WHY IT IS NOT A BOARD. test_pascal_pat_suite.sh grades all 427 vendored programs, so it is a
# board and refuses every seat but THE ONE RUNNER. This grades only a NAMED, fixed list of witnesses -- a gate
# population, not a board (CEO-547: what makes a run a board is the population it grades, not the entry point) -- so
# the owning HQ can measure its own cures between the coo's passes without standing in for the coo.
#
# THE LIST is the coo's 2026-09-13 full PAT accounting (baton pascal-pat-suite-427-to-100-percent-by-class): the named
# error-detection checks standing between PAT 271 and PAT 296, in the two classes that accounting identified, plus the
# seven file-state witnesses it found were the same class as the fifteen but had not been listed with them.
#
# THE CRITERION is the PAT suite's own for a REJECTION test: PASS means scrip exits NON-ZERO **with a diagnostic**, in
# BOTH modes. ⛔ A non-zero exit with an EMPTY diagnostic is NOT a rejection and is not scored as one -- 1710 and 1715
# exit 1 in m3 while printing nothing, and a runner that graded on rc alone would call them cured.
#
# ⛔⭐ THE m4 ARM LINKS AND RUNS, AND THIS AUDIT GOT IT WRONG ONCE. Its first version graded m4 with --compile -o
# /dev/null, which only COMPILES -- so a witness whose ISO condition is detected at RUN time could never fail that
# arm, and the audit reported 21 owed while the cure for eight of them was already landed and working in both modes.
# MEASURED 2026-09-16: 1710 compiled rc=0 under the old arm and, linked and run, exits 1 with its diagnostic. A
# compile-only arm cannot see a runtime check, and a rejection suite is mostly runtime checks. So m4 now compiles,
# LINKS against out/libscrip_rt.so and RUNS, and a witness passes that arm if EITHER the compile refuses or the
# resulting program does. ⭐ The general form, worth more than this row: an instrument that can observe only one half
# of a cure reports the other half as absent forever, and it does not get louder as the cure lands.
#
# This AUDITS; it does not gate. It exits 0 whenever it could measure, and REFUSES rc=2 when it could not (no binary,
# no vendored suite, or a witness missing) -- the number is the product, so a run that cannot produce one must not
# print the success shape. The board line is the last thing it prints and it is the only verdict here.
