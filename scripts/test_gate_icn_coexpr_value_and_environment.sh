# Measured 2026-09-06, before the cure:
#   type(create ...)                     SCRIP "string"  -- bb_create wrote the raw scrip_coctx_t* into
#                                        the DESCRIPTOR'S TAG WORD, so type() read the pointer's low byte
#                                        as a tag and every slot the value passed through handed the next
#                                        reader something it would mis-dispatch on.
#   global g inside a co-expression      SCRIP printed NOTHING where iconx prints 42 -- a global is read
#                                        as [r9 + off] and r9, the GVA base, was NOT among the six
#                                        registers the create packaged for the body's own thread.
#   c1 := create @c2 (c2 a global)       SIGSEGV, rc=139, in sem_post inside scrip_coswitch: the target
#                                        read out of that global was garbage, so the crash was the
#                                        SECOND symptom of the first two defects, not a third defect.
#
# ⛔ WHAT THIS GATE DOES NOT COVER, so a green is not read as co-expressions-complete: a captured LOCAL
# still reads empty inside the body (the frame snapshot is taken but not consulted), and EXHAUSTION does
# not hand control back to the activator -- the ping-pong witness runs all six activations and then loses
# main's continuation. Both are named on the row with their own witnesses.
# ⭐ THE MUTUAL-CYCLE ARM IS THE ONE THAT COST THE MOST AND IT IS WHY THIS GATE HAS SIX WITNESSES: c1
# activates c2 activates c1, so the activator chain is a CYCLE. A finished co-expression must return to a
# LIVE activator, and the walk that finds one must be BOUNDED -- an unbounded walk over a cycle of dead
# contexts HANGS, which is how the first version of that cure presented (the program stopped producing
# output and never exited, where the defect it replaced merely lost the last line).
# ⛔ REFUSES rc=2 unless all 12 runs (6 witnesses x 2 modes) are graded, and rc=2 if the oracle is absent.
