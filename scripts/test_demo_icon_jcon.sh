# test_demo_icon_jcon.sh -- THE JCON DEMO GATE. Grades the JCON compiler (Icon-in-Icon) as a SCRIP demo.
#
# WHAT JCON IS: Proebsting & Townsend's Icon-to-JVM compiler, written in Icon (corpus/packages/icon/
# jcon-compiler, 9953 lines + 2 generated modules). It is the largest real-world Icon program in the
# corpus, so it is the demo that answers "does SCRIP's Icon front end carry a whole compiler".
#
# ⭐ THE DEMO ENTRIES LINK, THEY DO NOT CONCATENATE. Each corpus/demos/icon/jcon/<name>.icn is a thin
# entry file of `link "<relpath>"` lines, resolved by SCRIP's own icn_resolve_links (src/parsers/icon/
# icon_driver.c:26, 64-file ceiling). This is deliberate: the previous way to build jtran was to hand
# all 18 package files to one command line, which silently merged FOUR `procedure main`s (jtran_main,
# linker, oplexgen, interfacegen) into one program. The link entries name exactly the modules each
# real JCON program is built from, per JCON's own tran/Makefile.
#
# ⛔ THE ORACLE IS BUILT HERE, FROM THE SAME SOURCES, EVERY RUN -- never a checked-in .ref. icont
# links the same module list from the same package dir, so an oracle/SCRIP difference is a SCRIP
# difference and cannot be a source-drift artifact.
#
# ⛔ REFUSES (rc=2) RATHER THAN SKIPPING. A missing icont, an unbuilt scrip, a missing package module
# or a demo entry that will not compile is UNPROVEN, never a pass: a gate that cannot measure must not
# report green (RULES.md; and the `make test` false-green trap this suite exists downstream of).
#
# ⛔ KNOWN-DIFF IS DECLARED IN THE TREE, NOT IN THIS SCRIPT. A demo whose output legitimately does not
# yet match carries <name>.knowndiff beside it, whose first line names the class. Such a row is
# reported KNOWN-DIFF and does not fail the gate -- but a KNOWN-DIFF row that starts MATCHING is
# reported XPASS and DOES fail, so a cure can never land silently and leave a stale marker behind.
#
# EXIT: 0 = every demo matched (or is a declared KNOWN-DIFF still differing).
#       1 = a regression: a demo that should match did not, or a KNOWN-DIFF started passing (XPASS).
#       2 = REFUSED/UNPROVEN: could not build or could not measure.
# USAGE: bash scripts/test_demo_icon_jcon.sh [name ...]      (default: every entry in the demo dir)
