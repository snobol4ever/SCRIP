#
# WHAT DRIFTED, AND WHY NO INSTRUMENT NOTICED.  ARCH-SNOBOL4-RTX.md section 2, which ARCH-ICON-RTX.md names as THE single
# source for the blob pins, reads rbx = arena heap top, DESCR mint pointer, under a heading requiring RTX to preserve
# every pin across every entry and exit.  The frontier lived in the HEAP arm of the ZC_PORT_* selector; FORTH was the
# live protocol and HEAP was kept granted-but-broken; when the no-modes law deleted the ZC_* arms the HEAP arm's register
# plane went with them, and rbx -- preserved by SysV and therefore free-looking -- was picked up as scratch by four
# emitted sites.  Nobody decided that.  NOTHING COULD FAIL, because a register plane written in a table and enforced
# nowhere has no failure mode.  r9 held the same years without drifting, and the only mechanical difference is the
# RTCC_GVA_REG _Static_assert in x86_asm.h.  This gate is that difference, for the six pins.
#
# ⛔ WHAT THIS GATE DOES NOT YET GRADE, DECLARED RATHER THAN MISSING.  The row's steps 2 and 3 flip rbx to a CACHE of
# g_hp_fr.top -- written back before a call that can allocate, reloaded after, never restored from a save -- and the two
# arms that grade THAT design are not here: the emitted .s advancing rbx with no per-allocation GOT load, and the round
# trip (allocate, collect inside a C-to-BB entry, allocate again) with a planted RESTORE-instead-of-RELOAD seam proven
# red.  THE REASON IS A MEASUREMENT, not an omission: emitted code never calls the allocator.  Zero mentions of
# rt_gcheap_alloc, rt_ws_alloc, rt_heap_alloc, rt_pm_struct_alloc or rt_agg_alloc in src/templates or src/emitter; the
# safe-point census reads 244 allocating call sites in emitted code and every one is a call into a runtime entry that
# allocates internally (1655 of 8645 runtime functions reach rt_gcheap_alloc), and the GOT load the row wants gone lives
# in rtx_alloc.s 7/46/60 and rtx_str.s 100 -- inside the runtime.  So there is no emitted instruction that reads or
# writes the frontier, and a cache with no consumer cannot be graded by reading the emitted .s.  The flip needs a new
# emitted allocation shape, which is a codegen design; it is rowed separately and those two arms land with it.
#
# THE ARMS.  (1) THE SCRATCH CENSUS, which is what step 1 earned and what this gate keeps: every spelling of rbx in
# src/templates and src/emitter is in the DECLARED set below, each entry named with its reason.  A sixth occurrence --
# the exact shape of the drift -- reds.  (2) THE PLANE IS DECLARED IN CODE: one _Static_assert per pin in x86_asm.h,
# in the RTCC_GVA_REG shape, naming the register the encoders use.  (3) the aligned-call saver uses no callee-saved
# register at all: the shared helpers park the caller's rsp on the aligned stack, and no template spells the old
# push-rbx form.  (4) FAIL_ONCE=1 plants a sixth rbx spelling into arm 1's population and requires this gate to red.
