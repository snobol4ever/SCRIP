# test_gate_mint_op_is_one_numbering.sh -- THE DESCRIPTOR'S PROVENANCE BYTE IS ONE NUMBERING, IT IS CALLED
# mint_op, AND THE ONLY THING THAT CAN OVERFLOW IT IS ASSERTED AT COMPILE TIME
# (row mint-op-is-one-numbering-from-1-the-123-rt-ids-go-and-the-field-is-renamed, hq_R 2026-09-13,
# CEO-719 as twice corrected on Lon's word; the cto is HQ).
#
# WHAT WENT WRONG, BECAUSE EVERY ARM HERE IS ONE CLAUSE OF IT. `mod_op` is a uint8_t recording WHICH BB MINTED
# a descriptor. Its name reads as MODIFIED, so a numbering that answers WHO MINTED looked like it needed a
# second population: 123 `MOD_OP_RT_*` ids, one per hand-written rtx/*.s minting routine, based at 130 with a
# comment saying that was "one past IR_OP_COUNT (129)". ⛔ THREE THINGS WERE WRONG AT ONCE. (1) IR_OP_COUNT was
# 136, not 129 -- measured by COMPILING it, not by reading the comment -- so seven IR ops stamped straight onto
# RT_FAILDESCR..RT_PROC_VALUE and a stamp reader could not tell a compiler mint from a runtime one, which is
# the exact property the 130 base existed to provide. (2) 1 + 136 + 123 = 260 IN A 256-WIDE FIELD: the space
# was not running out, IT WAS ALREADY OVER. (3) The rt ids were never a numbering of this at all -- they were a
# SECOND, ORTHOGONAL DIMENSION (which rt function a BB called, "Like BB_CALL, which call?"), and 118 of the 123
# have no IR-op counterpart by name because they name runtime HELPERS a BB calls, not BBs.
#
# ⭐ SO THE CURE IS A DELETION, A RENAME AND ONE ASSERT, AND THIS GATE HOLDS ALL THREE. The dimension is gone
# and its loss is DELIBERATE, TEMPORARY AND NAMED IN descr_tags.inc (Lon: "We can do without that granularity
# for now until we figure something else") -- ⛔ and the one thing a future reader must not do is put it back
# HERE: N values for "which rt" in this byte re-creates the overflow. ARM 1 is what stops it coming back one
# `#define` at a time.
#
# ⛔ ARM 3b IS THE ARM THAT MAKES ARM 3a MEAN ANYTHING: a static assert is invisible when it holds, so this
# gate also compiles a VIOLATING one through the same macro and REQUIRES the compiler to reject it. Without
# that, a DESCR_SASSERT accidentally defined empty would pass arm 3a forever while guarding nothing -- the
# green-when-measuring-nothing shape this tree refuses everywhere else.
# rc 0 green · 1 red · 2 could not measure.

# 255 would have stamped as a DIFFERENT op with nothing saying so. Lon REMOVED mint_op on 2026-09-18, in-chat,
# on the ground that the op is DERIVABLE from the node id (SCRIP 0a6f75394, CFO-100): the byte went to
# src_node, which is now 24 bits, and NOTHING CONSTRAINS IR_OP_COUNT TO A BYTE ANY MORE. An arm demanding that
# assert back demands a guard over a field that no longer exists — which is why this one arm has been RED for
# every seat since 09-18 while the other seven passed, and a red arm in the blocking set costs every seat its
# landing gate. So the arm now grades the guard the byte BECAME, in two places that must agree: IR.h keeps the
# RETIREMENT where the old assert stood, so the next reader cannot re-add a byte constraint by reading only the
# enum; and descr.h asserts the 24-bit field's two sentinels, because an id past that field must SATURATE — a
# wrapped id aliases two nodes and attributes CONFIDENTLY WRONGLY, which is strictly worse for a debugging tool
