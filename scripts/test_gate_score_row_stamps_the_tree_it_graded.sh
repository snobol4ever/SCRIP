# ⛔⭐ THE HAZARD, MEASURED THREE TIMES IN ONE SITTING AND TWICE WHILE DOING THE DISCIPLINED THING. A board takes
# ten to forty minutes; its SCORE.md write happens at the END. A seat who commits and pushes mid-run moves HEAD
# under a measurement that already happened, and the row then names a tree carrying commits it never ran.
# ⭐ AND THE GUARD PUSHES YOU INTO IT. CEO-174 skips the write on a dirty tree, so the way to make your row land is
# to commit before the board finishes -- which is exactly the act that moves HEAD. The safeguard and the hazard
# are the same gesture, which is why care does not protect against this one and a mechanism has to.
# ⛔ IT ASSERTS BEHAVIOUR, NOT WIRING: unset, the stamp must be byte-identical to what it always was, because
# every runner that has not been taught the variable still has to publish exactly as before.
