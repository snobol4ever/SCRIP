# test_gate_sno_proc_own_name_byname_mid_return.sh -- a DEFINE'd proc's own name reads BLANK through an
# external by-name ($NAME) lookup while that proc is in the middle of returning.
#
# Row: defined-proc-own-name-blank-via-byname-lookup-mid-return (hq_U). Witness minted and oracle-verified by
# seat11 2026-09-05; this gate is the runnable criterion for it (the row carried the placeholder DONE-WHEN and
# was therefore UNPICKABLE -- ceo census 19:02).
#
# ⛔ WHAT THIS IS NOT (seat11 ruled these out; do not re-derive them):
#   - NOT the retval threaded through rt_trace_return_hook: rt_trace_event's registered-callback branch never
#     reads its own value parameter, so that plumbing is correct but INERT here.
#   - NOT an RTCC_GLOBAL_R9_GVA vs absolute-addressing split: an ordinary global's own by-name read through the
#     identical NAMEVAL path, in the identical callback, resolves correctly.
#   F differs only in being the name of the procedure CURRENTLY ACTIVE/returning at the instant of the lookup.
#
# TRACE is the INSTRUMENT here, not the subject: it is currently the only way to run code at the exact instant
# of a return before it completes. A cure is a symbol-resolution fix, not a TRACE fix.
#
# Graded in BOTH modes against /home/resources/x64/bin/sbl -bf. rc=0 both match, rc=1 either diverges,
# rc=2 could not measure (no oracle, no binary, build/link failure, zero programs graded).

# ⛔ THE SECOND WITNESS IS THE DISCRIMINATOR, AND IT IS THE REASON THIS GATE EXISTS IN THIS SHAPE.
# The first witness grades the TARGET (the by-name mid-return read). It is satisfiable by a cure that
# moves the return-value staging earlier and clobbers the ordinary return path on the way -- which is
# exactly what d067ceae4 did: this gate read PASS while every DEFINE'd function returned blank, and the
# landing was reverted fleet-wide (CEO-333). A DONE-WHEN that names one output line cannot notice what
# the cure spent to get it. So the plain return value is graded here too, in both modes, against the
# same oracle: a cure that buys the tagR line by breaking ordinary returns now reds its own gate.
