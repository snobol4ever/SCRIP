# EXTENDS NO-NEW-GLOBALS (RULES.md line 169) TO FUNCTION-SCOPE MUTABLE STATICS -- SCOPED TO src/runtime/ ONLY.
# The existing enforcement ("diffs checked for new file-scope definitions", GOAL-*.md's ENFORCEMENT lines,
# test_gate_pl_no_new_global.sh) names only FILE-SCOPE declarations and the Prolog g_* naming convention.
# Neither catches `static int x = -1;` sitting inside a function body -- and static storage duration, not the
# scope keyword, is the property the law guards (ceo ruling 2026-09-01, RULES.md line 169, receipt: hq_P's
# self-raised question on two getenv killswitch statics in emit.cpp's zd_plan). This gate is the missing half.
#
# ⛔⛔ SCOPE RE-CUT 2026-09-02 (ceo, routed hq_B, on Lon in-chat verbatim: "You can always add as many g_emit
# values as you want. Those were never part of the no global rule."): the clarification that minted this row
# was itself an overshoot -- COMPILE-TIME working state (emitter/lower/ir/driver/optimizer/templates/parsers,
# which runs once per COMPILATION, not once per program execution) was NEVER the target; ordinary long-
# standing practice there needs no grant. Scope is now src/runtime/ ONLY -- the tree that becomes
# libscrip_rt.so and is executed by every COMPILED program at ITS OWN runtime, which is where a new,
# ungranted mutable static is genuinely new PROGRAM state and genuinely load-bearing on the SCOPE GUARD's
# own terms (a per-match/per-dispatch hot path). A compile-time-scoped conversion was built, verified, and
# then DISCARDED under this re-cut before landing -- salvage patch:
# /home/resources/postoffice/salvage/seat07-census-function-scope-mutable-statics-under-src-compile-time-DISCARDED-2026-09-02.patch
# (worth reading before anyone reopens compile-time scope: the discarded conversion, though behaviorally a
# pure deletion in every single site, measurably broke corpus witness pos_rpos_alt_branch_5 with a
# deterministic runtime ERROR 246 stack overflow -- root cause not fully traced, plausibly one of
# bb_match_defer.cpp's getenv-cache flags selecting an inconsistent code-generation strategy across the
# function's two compile-time invocations for a self-referential deferred pattern. Bisected cleanly:
# pre-conversion tree passes the witness 2/2 runs, converted tree fails 3/3 runs, deterministic either way.)
#
# MECHANISM: a PER-FILE RATCHET, not a single scalar and not a symbol-name allowlist (unlike
# test_gate_pl_no_new_global.sh's g_* SANCTIONED list) -- function-scope statics are overwhelmingly named
# with short, non-unique locals (`v`, `on`, `m`, `p`...), so a name-based allowlist would be ambiguous by
# construction; a name in one function tells you nothing about a same-named local in another. Per-file
# COUNTS are stable under line-number churn elsewhere in the file and, combined with the GRANT-comment
# carve-out below, are precise enough to catch a genuinely NEW site while a pure global scalar total (the
# INSTRUMENT LAWS' "count-only criteria" warning) could hide one new site behind an unrelated conversion
# landing in the same commit. A file with NO baseline row has an implicit ceiling of ZERO. Paths in the
# baseline and in this gate's own file-keys are relative to CENSUS_ROOT (src/runtime/ by default, override
# with FSS_ROOT), NOT to src/ -- e.g. "core/core.c", not "runtime/core/core.c".
#
# GRANT CARVE-OUT: per the row's brief -- "needs a cited grant, and if none exists say so LOUDLY rather
# than minting one retroactively" -- a static whose declaration LINE contains the literal marker `GRANT:`
# is excluded from the ratchet count entirely (it is documented, sanctioned state, the function-scope
# sibling of test_gate_pl_no_new_global.sh's SANCTIONED list comment blocks). Landing a GRANT: comment
# without an actual cited Lon ruling is exactly the "quiet ask does not count as asking" violation RULES.md
# already forbids -- this gate does not (yet) verify the citation's substance, only that the marker exists;
# review is still required, same as any other law-citing comment.
#
# ⛔ RATCHET LOWERING IS MANUAL, NEVER AUTO (same law as test_gate_icn_rbp_census_ratchet.sh): when a
# session converts or grants sites in a file, it lowers that file's row in func_scope_static_baseline.tsv
# in the SAME commit. This script never rewrites the baseline itself.
