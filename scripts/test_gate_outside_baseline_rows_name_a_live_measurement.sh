# scripts/test_gate_outside_baseline_rows_name_a_live_measurement.sh -- EVERY OUTSIDE-BASELINE EXCLUSION NAMES
# THE MEASUREMENT THAT PUT IT THERE, AND THE ORACLE STILL AGREES TODAY.
# AUTHORS: Lon Jones Cherryholmes · Claude Opus 5   DATE: 2026-09-11
#
# ⛔⭐⭐ AN EXCLUSION IS A SUBTRACTION FROM THE DENOMINATOR, SO ITS REASON IS A NUMBER, NOT PROSE. Every row in
# a package's OUTSIDE_SPITBOL_BASELINE.tsv removes one program from the score anyone quotes. The record is
# hand-maintained -- nothing generates it, unlike a container's ALL.excluded.txt -- which is exactly why it
# needs an instrument: a reason written by a hand and re-read by a hand only ever re-confirms itself.
#
# ⛔⭐ THE CLASS THIS WAS BUILT AGAINST, measured 2026-09-11 by hq_R across all six SNOBOL4 packages (149 rows):
# FIVE csnobol4 rows read `sbl -bf rc=1: ` -- the diagnostic they promise to quote is the EMPTY STRING. The
# oracle is not silent on any of them; it prints ERROR 230, ERROR 214 and ERROR 014 x3. Whoever composed those
# reasons took the oracle's FIRST line, and sbl -bf opens with three blank lines and a banner. So five programs
# left the denominator on the strength of a quotation of nothing, and nothing has re-asked since 2026-09-07.
# ⭐ THE SAME SHAPE, THIRD SUITE DEEP: the IPL container's 65 ORACLE_FAIL reasons were hand-composed the same
# way (SCRIP bbcaff43a), and the cure there was the same -- re-ask the oracle, never re-spell the reason.
#
# ⛔ A REF DIAGNOSTIC IS A DEATH CERTIFICATE, NOT A CAUSE OF DEATH, and this gate is why that matters here.
# `No END statement found in source file(s).` is what SPITBOL prints after it has ALREADY aborted on a fatal
# error and therefore never reached the END -- so it is the last line for a whole family of unrelated causes.
# Measured on the 14 csnobol4 rows that quote it: THIRTEEN are honest (the oracle emits no ERROR NNN at all,
# so the certificate is the only diagnostic there is), and ONE -- crlf.sno -- is really ERROR 230 illegal
# character. ⭐ That is why ARM 3 keys on the quoted ERROR NNN rather than on the whole line: a row that names
# a number makes a falsifiable claim, and a row that names only the certificate makes none.
#
# ⛔⭐⭐ AN rc=124 IS NOT A REFUSAL AND IS NEVER STALE -- THE THIRD NARROWING OF ARM 2, found by hq_P 2026-09-12 by
# landing CEO-591 against this gate. ARM 2 decided a ruling was stale by asking whether the oracle's output holds
# an ERROR NNN or the no-END certificate. A program the oracle NEVER FINISHES prints NEITHER, so the arm rendered
# rc=0-with-no-diagnostic and rc=124-with-no-diagnostic IN THE SAME SENTENCE -- 'refuses this program with no
# diagnostic today; it belongs back in the denominator' -- when they are opposite facts. It told hq_P to readmit
# gimpel's PHRASE_driver and QUEST_driver, measured rc=124 with ZERO output at 25s AND at 90s, fed from their own
# .input fixture and unfed alike: following it would have put TWO PERMANENT TIMEOUTS into a graded denominator.
# ⭐ THE CURE IS A BRANCH BEFORE THE DIAGNOSTIC TEST, AND IT IS SHARPER THAN 'EXEMPT THE TIMEOUTS'. 'The oracle
# never finishes' IS ITSELF A FALSIFIABLE CLAIM, so this gate grades it the same way it grades a quoted ERROR NNN:
#   · rc=124 + the row claims non-termination  -> CONFIRMED LIVE, with the elapsed time and the budget. Not a defect.
#   · rc=124 + the row quotes a diagnostic     -> WRONG CAUSE: the oracle never reached any refusal it could print,
#                                                 so the row promises a quotation the oracle cannot make.
# ⛔ AND THE VERDICT NAMES THE BUDGET, NEVER 'DOES NOT TERMINATE': this instrument can only ever witness 'did not
# finish within Ns'. --timeout raises N for a package owner who wants a stronger witness without editing the gate.
# ⭐ WHY THIS ONE IS WORTH A PARAGRAPH RATHER THAN A LINE: the gate was not careless, it was CAREFUL AND STILL
# NARROW -- its own header already documents two earlier versions of this exact error (keying ARM 2 on rc, and $?
# after a pipeline reading tr's status, which called 78 sound rulings stale), and the warning it needed was already
# written one file away, unprompted, in test_gate_package_runners_print_the_inventory: 'an rc=124 is a TIMEOUT
# FIRING ... it cannot distinguish needs-8.1s from never-finishes. If a verdict turns on duration, record the
# duration.' A correct warning in a neighbouring file is not wired into anything. THAT is why the duration is
# printed here and why the classes must close over the population below.
#
# ⛔ THIS IS NOT A BOARD AND MUST NEVER BECOME ONE (ONE RUNNER, ONE BOARD -- only the coo runs a package board).
# It runs the ORACLE ALONE over the recorded rows only, never scrip, never the shipped set, and prints no
# pass/total for any suite. Its denominator is the RECORD's size, which is the only population it grades.
#
# Usage: bash scripts/test_gate_outside_baseline_rows_name_a_live_measurement.sh [--package <name>] [--strict] [--timeout <s>]
# rc=0 every recorded row names a live measurement · rc=1 a row does not · rc=2 cannot measure.
