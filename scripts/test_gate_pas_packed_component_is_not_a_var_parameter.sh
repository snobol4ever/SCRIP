# test_gate_pas_packed_component_is_not_a_var_parameter.sh -- ISO 7185 6.6.3.3: a component of a PACKED structure shall not be an
# actual variable parameter. The oracle is `fpc -Miso`, which rejects all three shapes at COMPILE time ("The address cannot be taken
# of bit packed array elements and record fields"); before this gate SCRIP accepted two of them and bombed at run time on the third.
# ⛔ PAT IS A REJECTION SUITE, so the graded question is NOT "what did it print" but "did it refuse, with a diagnostic, WITHOUT
# crashing". A SIGNAL (rc >= 128) is a CRASH and is NEVER a pass -- under a bare `rc != 0` test a SIGSEGV would score as a correct
# rejection and the suite would reward the compiler for behaving worse. Same rule as test_pascal_pat_suite.sh, stated once per gate.
# ⛔ THE NEGATIVE ARMS ARE THE HALF THAT MATTERS. A rule that rejects programs is only as good as what it leaves alone: an
# over-broad packed test would silently start refusing legal Pascal, and the PAT board would go UP while the language got smaller.
# So every ACCEPT arm below is a program fpc -Miso compiles, and the gate is red if any of them is refused.
# ⛔ ONE ARM IS GRADED `NOWIDEN` AND THAT IS NOT AN XFAIL WEARING A NEW NAME -- READ WHAT IT ASSERTS. unpacked_nested_field_is_legal
# passes a nested UNPACKED field as a variable parameter: fpc -Miso compiles and runs it, and SCRIP kills it in the EMITTER
# (`FATAL emit_drive: IR op=5 HAS a template and its own case REFUSED AT A GUARD`) both before and after this cure -- measured on
# both sides of the change, so it is a standing defect of nested record var-parameters and belongs to its own row, not to this one.
# Grading it ACCEPT would make THIS gate red for a defect it does not own; deleting it would drop the only arm at the depth where an
# over-broad packed test is most likely to misfire. So it asserts the question this gate actually owns: THE 6.6.3.3 DIAGNOSTIC MUST
# NOT APPEAR. It is red the moment the rule widens onto an unpacked nested field, and it goes green-by-accident for nobody: when the
# emitter defect is cured this arm keeps grading exactly what it grades today, and should then be promoted to ACCEPT.
