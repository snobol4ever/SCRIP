# with CSNOBOL4 specifically, and silently substituting a different oracle would change WHAT IS ASSERTED while
# leaving the name intact — the same class of defect this file is being repaired for. Needs a ruling on which
# oracle beauty grades against; until then it refuses honestly rather than quietly measuring something else.
