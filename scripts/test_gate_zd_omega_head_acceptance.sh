#
# hq_B root-caused: zd_omega_head (emit.cpp:2498) is a PER-OP FILTER admitting only IR_CMP_TEST while
# Pascal's relop lowers to its sibling IR_BINOP_TEST (RULES.md NO-PER-OP-FILTER). One cause, four tracked
# failures: boolptr, boolidx (same defect via an array lvalue), and the bubble/quick mode-4 spine leaks
# (their own row's one-line description, "zd_plan misses IR_BINOP_TEST merge points", was right all along).
# This row was minted with NO runnable DONE-WHEN; this script IS that DONE-WHEN, per the row's own NEXT.
#
# Checks, in order, REFUSING rc=2 on any missing prerequisite (a missing binary or corpus file is a
# refusal to grade, never a silent pass -- RULES.md "A MISSING PREREQUISITE IS A REFUSAL"):
#   1. STRUCTURAL   -- the exact known-bad single-op admission string named in the FINDING is gone from
#                      zd_omega_head. A regression witness, not a proof the replacement is correct.
#   2. NAMED WITNESSES -- boolptr + boolidx byte-match their .ref in BOTH m3 and m4 (surgical: this row is
#                      about these two names, not the whole Pascal board -- deep5/pb34 are separate,
#                      already-tracked defects and must not gate this row either way). Since corpus efb71c7a9
#                      (2026-09-06) both live in corpus/tests/pascal/ALL.pas; the arm extracts them by origin
#                      through corpus_suite_harness.py, the one reader, byte-identical to the files they were.
#   2b. REGRESSION DETECTOR -- a_plainvar + f_const_then_relop (hq_B's FINDING, inline, not corpus fixtures):
#                      the naive 2-line candidate cure passes boolptr/boolidx while silently regressing
#                      a_plainvar, so checking only the two named failures would wave a wrong fix through.
#   3. SPINE LEAK   -- bubble + quick, mode 4, 5/5 runs each under `setarch -R` (fixed address layout):
#                      rc=0 and output byte-matches the checked-in .ref every time. A real per-iteration
#                      $rsp leak crashes before a full-size sort completes, so 5/5 clean full-size runs is
#                      sufficient behavioural evidence without re-deriving seat12/seat02's instruction trace.
#   4. RETIRED 2026-10-01 (the coo): the shared-node control battery ran five boards as a fixture -- the
#                      SNOBOL4 master, the Icon rungs (floor 232), the Raku smoke, the Prolog crosscheck (a
#                      fail-set pinned 09-02) and the polyglot demos. Under ONE TESTING OFFICER (CEO-1342)
#                      the coo's SUITE TABLE is that verdict and a fixture may not grade the shared corpus,
#                      so the arm could only refuse once arm 2 read again.
#
# ⛔ THIS GATE DOES NOT BUILD. Run `make pristine` yourself first for a real verdict (HQ-27) -- running a
# board and a build in the same tree is independently forbidden (RULES.md s268), and this row's own history
# (a live claim on pascal-restore-prezeta touching this exact code) is the direct witness of why that
# matters: do not run this gate concurrently with a build in the same working tree.
#
# Exit: 0 all green · 1 measured and something failed · 2 refused to grade (prerequisite missing).
