"""util_board_field_matcher_census.py -- EVERY MATCHER THAT READS A BOARD LINE BY POSITION (coo, CEO-839, row
instruments-rc2-gate-arm9-anchors-on-board-line-position-and-has-been-red-since-shipped-entered-the-line).

THE DISEASE, stated once: a check that matches a SUITE_BOARD line by ADJACENCY breaks the day a correct field is
inserted, and it breaks SILENTLY -- it reports the board as absent, which reads like "the run graded nothing"
rather than "my pattern is stale".  test_gate_harness_refusal_is_rc2.sh arm 9 greps
'^SUITE_BOARD family=ALL total=2 m3_n=2 ' and has been RED since SCRIP 3ade619f2 put `shipped=` and `outside=`
between total= and m3_n= (CEO-749/772).  The board it rejects is correct.  That is the instrument law
EXTRACTION ANCHORS ON IDENTITY, NEVER POSITION failing inside a gate whose whole job is guarding a refusal code.

WHAT THIS COUNTS, and what it deliberately does not:
  MATCHER  a string literal used as a PATTERN -- grep/grep -q/egrep/case, or re.compile/search/match/findall/
           fullmatch/sub, or bash =~.  Only a matcher can go stale against a board it did not write.
  PRINTER  a literal that is EMITTED (echo/printf/print/ck label).  A runner printing its own board line is the
           board's author, not its reader: inserting a field there is the landing, not the breakage.  Counted
           and NAMED on its own line so the next reader does not re-walk the same path, never in the population.
  FIXTURE  a literal ASSIGNED to a variable and written into a scratch file -- sample board text a matcher reads.
           Same reasoning as PRINTER.
  ADJACENT two board fields separated by nothing but literal whitespace: `total=2 m3_n=2`.  ANY insertion between
           them breaks it.  THIS IS THE POPULATION, and its want is 0.
  ORDERED  two board fields separated by a wildcard: `family=\\S+ .*m3_n=(\\d+)`.  Survives an insertion, breaks
           only on a REORDER.  NAMED beside the population with its count, never folded into it -- it is a weaker
           form of the same anchoring and a reader deciding what to cure next needs both numbers.

THE FIELD VOCABULARY IS DERIVED FROM THE PRINTER, NEVER HAND-WRITTEN: this tool reads the f-string fields of
corpus_suite_harness.py's own SUITE_BOARD assembly, so a field added there is a field here on the next run, and
REFUSES rc=2 when it cannot find that printer -- a census whose vocabulary no longer describes the tree reports
zeros that mean nothing.  Per-mode fields are matched by SUFFIX (`_pass`, `_fail`, `_n`, ...) so a regex that
builds the name with a backreference -- `(m[34])_pass=(\\d+) \\1_fail=` -- is still read as two board fields.

rc: 0 no ADJACENT matcher remains; 1 at least one does; 2 the vocabulary could not be derived.
