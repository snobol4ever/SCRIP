# rt_goto_transfer()'s resolve failure is now EXPRESSIBLE, not silently absorbed as success (row
# rt-goto-transfer-is-failure-blind, hq_U 2026-09-05). Before this cure, rt_goto_transfer() returned
# void; core_runtime_error()'s SETEXIT trap arm read "returned at all" as "the handler ran" and fell
# into an unconditional exit(0). A SETEXIT(.LABEL) whose LABEL never resolves therefore ended the
# program mid-stream with ZERO output and rc=0, in BOTH modes, where SPITBOL survives the error (the
# trap attempt still consumes one &ERRLIMIT unit, but no handler runs, and the interrupted statement's
# own :S()/:F() takes over) and continues.
# MEASURED against the shared correctness oracle (/home/resources/x64/bin/sbl -bf, s189/s261): a
# program that SETEXIT(.NOSUCH)s (NOSUCH is never a label anywhere in the source) and then divides by
# zero prints "FAILEXIT\nAFTER" at rc=0 -- no HANDLER line, no error text, no crash. Proven non-vacuous
# by stash-and-rebuild (this row, 2026-09-05): the pre-cure tree prints NOTHING at rc=0 for this exact
# witness, in both modes; the identical demo-set control arm sweep (test_demo_descent_sweep.sh, RULES.md
# the DEMO-SET CONTROL ARM) was run stashed and unstashed and produced BYTE-IDENTICAL 14 DIFF/1
# COMPILE_FAIL/11 PASS buckets both times, proving those reds predate this row and are not this cure's.
# The cure: rt_goto_transfer() (src/runtime/runtime_eval.c) keeps its ORIGINAL error-reporting behaviour
# for its other two callers (the GOTO_DEFERRED codegen fallback arm, sno_setexit_fire_on_end) -- it still
# calls the reporting rt_goto_resolve() and now returns 1/0 for transferred/not. A NEW sibling,
# rt_goto_transfer_checked(), is the only caller of a new rt_goto_resolve_x(name,&undef) internal that can
# ask "would this resolve" WITHOUT recursing into core_runtime_error() -- core_runtime_error()'s own
# SETEXIT trap arm (src/runtime/core/core.c) is the only caller of THAT, because it is the one call site
# that cannot safely re-enter itself (the recursive call landed with _setexit_label already cleared,
# which made the original bug's silent double-absorption invisible instead of loud).
