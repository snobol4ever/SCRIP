# test_gate_sno_byname_goto_zeta_unwind_in_a_loop.sh -- A BY-NAME GOTO OUT OF A MATCH STATEMENT UNWINDS TO THE MATCH WATERMARK, NOT TO ZERO.
#
# WHAT THIS IS: in SNOBOL4 a transfer `:(X)` whose target is computed (`$X`) lowers to a FOUR-node
# IR_GOTO_DEFERRED chain -- the ^R/^F/^N special-transfer tests, then a resolve that calls rt_goto_resolve and
# jumps to the returned address. When that transfer leaves a statement that CONTAINS A PATTERN MATCH, the node
# that leaves the statement is the chain head, an IR_GOTO_DEFERRED -- not the IR_STATEMENT_END that a plain
# `:(L)` would exit through.
#
# THE DEFECT THIS PINS: zd_plan (src/emitter/emit.cpp) computes the exit pop for a node leaving a statement as
# the MATCH-BEGIN WATERMARK (zdh_match + emit_match_begin_stfh_k()) rather than the statement's full zeta depth,
# because a match's own epilogue has already released the bytes above that watermark. That rule was gated on
# `op == IR_STATEMENT_END || op == IR_STATEMENT`. IR_GOTO_DEFERRED was not in the set, so it fell through to the
# full depth and emitted `add rsp, <full>` -- OVER-popping by exactly the watermark on every traversal. The pop
# is emitted at BOTH ports of the chain head (gamma = the special-transfer landing, omega = the hop to the next
# test), and the omega port is the one the ordinary case takes, so both arms of the fallback needed the rule.
#
# ⭐ IT IS AN OVER-POP, NOT A LEAK, AND THAT IS WHY IT LOOKED LIKE ONE. rsp CLIMBS 16 bytes per traversal
# (measured at the loop head: e070 -> e080 -> e090 -> e0a0 on the pre-cure build, flat at e060 after). Nothing
# is lost; the stack pointer walks UP through its own frame until it passes the frame base, after which the
# program is executing with rsp above live data and dies at whatever it jumps through next. On an 8MB stack the
# witness died at ~4200 iterations -- not because 8MB was exhausted, but because only ~73KB of headroom
# separated the loop's rsp from the frame base. A stack-exhaustion reading of the crash predicts a threshold
# ~100x larger than the measured one, which is how the over-pop reading was chosen over the leak reading.
#
# ⛔ THE b-ARM IS THE ONLY ARM THE CURE FLIPS AND IT WAS PROVEN RED ON A BUILD WITHOUT THE CURE (clean HEAD
# 03402a0fc, built into a separate tree so the objdir could not be shared): b1 m4 rc=139, everything else rc=0.
# The three c-arms were GREEN BEFORE AND AFTER and are not decoration -- each one pins a boundary of the change:
#   c1  the same loop with a PLAIN LABEL target. Exits through IR_STATEMENT_END, which always had the rule.
#       If a future change makes the deferred chain stop being the exit node, b1 and c1 stop differing.
#   c2  a by-name goto out of a statement with NO MATCH IN IT. There is no watermark (zdh_match < 0), so the
#       rule must NOT fire and the full depth remains correct. This is the arm that would catch the cure being
#       written as an unconditional "deferred gotos pop less".
#   b2  the same match statement with a match that FAILS, so the transfer leaves through the statement's omega
#       exits and the SECOND deferred chain. Green on both builds; it is here because the failure path reaches
#       a different chain and nothing else in the suite grades it.
#
# ⛔ ITERATION COUNT IS LOAD-BEARING, NOT ARBITRARY. 20000 iterations is ~4.3x the measured pre-cure crash
# threshold on this host's 8MB stack. A drift of 16 bytes per traversal needs roughly 4600 traversals to reach
# the frame base; grading at, say, 1000 would print a green board for a fully live defect. If this gate is ever
# green on a build you believe is broken, raise N before concluding anything.
#
# EXIT: 0 all arms match SPITBOL. 1 an arm regressed. 2 UNPROVEN (no built scrip, no oracle, or nothing graded).
