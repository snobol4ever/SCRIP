#
# A FOSSIL PATH is a default path VALUE, hardcoded into a scripts/*.sh variable assignment, that
# points at a corpus directory which no longer exists on disk. Motivation, all measured 2026-08-24:
# the demo/corpus tree was repointed five times in one day; `INC` still defaults to
# `$CORPUS/demos/inc` in at least six scripts, and `corpus/demos/inc` does not exist (the includes
# live at `corpus/include`); `CORPUS-LOCATIONS.md` described a layout the s271-s272 reorg dissolved.
# A script that silently resolves its corpus dir to a smaller-or-empty set (or fails a `[ -d ]`
# check nobody is watching) does not FAIL loudly — it just quietly grades less than it claims to,
# the same "board could not say NO" class as SCRIP 9873fe6e (test_corpus_snobol4.sh's own rc=2).
#
# SCOPE, deliberately narrow (task's own words): "default path values in scripts/*.sh — a path that
# is merely mentioned in a COMMENT is not a defect." This gate parses ASSIGNMENTS only, quoted or
# not (both are common in this tree), two shapes:
#   VAR="${ENVVAR:-literal/with/$OTHERVAR/refs}"   VAR=${ENVVAR:-literal/with/$OTHERVAR/refs}
#   VAR="literal/with/$OTHERVAR/refs"              VAR=literal/with/$OTHERVAR/refs
# and resolves $OTHERVAR/${OTHERVAR} references using ONLY the same file's own simple assignments
# (collected in file order, so a later default can build on an earlier one exactly as the shell
# itself would) plus $S4E (always known — this gate's own resolved sibling root) and a seeded
# $CORPUS = $S4E/corpus (the convention observed in the majority of scripts; a file that defines
# CORPUS via one of these shapes overrides the seed with its own value before resolution runs).
# A resolved value that still contains a $VAR, or a glob, is SKIPPED rather than guessed at — this
# gate reports what it can PROVE false, not what it suspects. A resolved value may be a
# whitespace-separated LIST of paths (e.g. `CORPUS_DIRS="$A $B"`) — each token is checked on its own.
#
# Further scoped to tokens that resolve under a `corpus` path segment (the task's own "corpus/
# source path" wording, and every named motivating example) and that look like a DIRECTORY
# reference (the last path segment has no dot-extension) — a file path meant to be CREATED as
# output almost always carries an extension or lives outside corpus/, so this keeps the false-
# positive rate low without hand-listing today's known-bad paths (which would be the "editing a
# test to return 0" trap the task explicitly forbids: this gate is satisfiable ONLY by making the
# path resolve for real, or by removing the fossil default, never by weakening what it checks).
#
# ⛔ NOT A FULL BASH PARSER. This is a best-effort static heuristic, not a shell interpreter: command
# substitutions (`$(...)`), arithmetic, and multi-hop chains through a var this gate could not
# resolve are SKIPPED, not guessed. A script whose only corpus default is built that way is invisible
# to this gate — narrower coverage on purpose, in exchange for zero false positives from a wrong guess.
