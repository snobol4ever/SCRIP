# test_gate_raku_paren_call_passes_its_arguments.sh -- a parenthesized Raku call must pass its ARGUMENTS,
# never one concatenated list (hq_T 2026-09-06, CEO-332 / Lon: "let's not see stuck ever again ... go fix ONE
# program in each and let's begin the climb").
#
# ⛔ THE DEFECT, measured on roast S04-statements/until.t. `is($i, 5, 'desc')` built
#     (TT_FNC __rk_test_is (TT_VAR __rk_test_is) (TT_FNC __rk_arr (TT_VAR __rk_arr) (TT_VAR i) (TT_ILIT 5) ...))
# -- ONE argument, a list -- while `is $i, 5, 'desc'` built the correct three. The grammar HAS a
# `TESTOP '(' arg_list ')'` rule; it is unreachable for a comma list, because `TESTOP arg_list` also matches
# with arg_list being a single parenthesized list expression, and bison resolves it that way. The .y author's
# intent was right and the rule is dead.
#
# ⛔⭐ WHY IT NEEDED A GATE RATHER THAN A BOARD. THE TEST STILL EMITTED VALID TAP. It printed its plan, it
# printed four `not ok` lines with a diagnostic, it exited 0 -- everything a harness looks at was well formed,
# and the only evidence was inside the message text ("got: '55until $i >= 5 {} works'", three arguments
# concatenated). A whole-file board can only ever say 986 to 985. Nothing anywhere would have named the CALL
# FORM. And it is a construct so basic that a reader scanning for it does not see it: every roast file calls
# testops both ways on adjacent lines, so the working form sits beside the broken one on every page.
#
# ⭐ THE ARMS ARE DIFFERENTIAL, AND THAT IS WHAT MAKES THEM CHEAP AND ORACLE-FREE. The property is not "is()
# prints X" -- which would need a hand-authored expectation that can rot -- it is THE TWO CALL FORMS OF THE
# SAME CALL MUST AGREE. f(a, b, c) and f a, b, c are the same program in Raku, so any divergence is a defect
# without anyone having to say which side is right. A hand-written expected value could have been written to
# match the buggy output; this cannot.
#
# ⛔ AND ONE ABSOLUTE ARM, because a differential gate alone is satisfiable by breaking BOTH forms: the arity
# actually reaching the callee is asserted directly, so "they agree" cannot become "they agree at 1 argument".
#
# FAILED ONCE: every arm below was run against the pre-cure binary and arms 1-4 FAILED there (m3 and m4 both:
# got '55paren form' where the listop form printed 'ok 1 - paren form'); arm 5 passed before and after, which
# is the control that says the cure did not simply delete the listop path.

# run_both <file> -> prints "m3<TAB>m4" md5s; a mode that will not build prints BUILDFAIL, never an empty

#
# ⛔⭐⭐ A CRASH IS NOT A VERDICT, AND THIS GATE USED TO TURN ONE INTO A DIVERGE (hq_T 2026-09-06, ceo CEO-365).
# `scrip --compile` on these witnesses SIGSEGVs INTERMITTENTLY and the failure was folded into the same
# BUILDFAIL string a genuine build error produces -- then COMPARED as a value, so one arm crashing and the
# other succeeding printed "m4 DIVERGE: listop BUILDFAIL vs paren <md5>". That names the wrong defect
# entirely: the two call forms did not disagree, one of them never ran. And this gate is ARM 2 OF 60 in
# `make test`, so that false red stopped the other 58 arms -- including the SNOBOL4 board -- fleet-wide.
# ⭐ MEASURED, not inferred, and the mechanism is NOT the load-race it looked like: 3/20 SEGV on --compile
# and 5/20 on --run with ASLR ON, and 0/20 under `setarch -R`. It is an ASLR-DEPENDENT crash in the Raku
# front end -- the same signature as the SNOBOL4 fuzz family -- and it is a REAL defect that belongs in its
# own row, NOT something this gate should hide. So: crashes are detected as crashes, retried a bounded
# number of times, and if they persist the gate REFUSES rc=2 NAMING them, rather than reporting a
# disagreement that did not happen. A gate that cannot measure says so (RULES.md: refuse, never skip-as-
# success -- and never fail-as-verdict either, which is the same lie wearing the other hat).
CRASHED=0
# ⭐⭐ THE MEASUREMENT RUNS UNDER `setarch -R` (ASLR OFF) AND THAT IS A NARROWING, NOT A COVER-UP.
# This gate's subject is ONE property -- a parenthesized call passes its arguments -- and that property is
# deterministic. The intermittent SIGSEGV it kept tripping over is ASLR-dependent (3/20 and 5/20 with ASLR
# on, 0/20 with it off) and is a DIFFERENT defect in the Raku front end, which gets its own row rather than
# being laundered through this gate's verdict either way. Grading the deterministic property
# deterministically is what a gate is for; the crash detection below stays as the safety net, so if the
# crash ever appears WITHOUT ASLR this gate refuses instead of quietly reporting a disagreement.
