"""util_refless_census.py -- EVERY BENCHMARK, DEMO, TEST AND GC WITNESS CARRYING NO REF, BY LANGUAGE, BY NAME.

Row instruments-the-refless-census-names-every-benchmark-and-test-carrying-no-ref-by-language
(coo, 2026-09-21, MODE TENET).

LON'S ORDER, verbatim to the ceo 2026-09-20: "Add a REF file for all benchmark and tests since how would you
know what you are measuring unless the output is correct." Landed as RULES.md FACT RULES clause 1.

⛔ THIS IS THE CENSUS AND NOT THE CUTTING. Each language's HQ cuts its own refs from its own oracle, because
only that oracle can say what the right answer is, and that obligation is already law. What did not exist is
the instrument that NAMES every refless program by language, so the fleet can tell progress from a narrowed
denominator. So a refless program is never a failure HERE: this instrument exits 0 whenever it could measure,
and the number it prints is the work outstanding, not a red. It REFUSES rc=2 when it can find no population,
because reporting zero refless programs for a tree it could not read is the one answer that would be a lie.

⛔ IT NAMES AND NEVER ONLY COUNTS (CEO-997 batch 30 clause 2 -- an instrument that aggregates must be able to
answer "name one member of this count"). Every count printed here is followed by its members; --check FAILS
if any nonzero count cannot produce one. A bare "168 refless" is the shape that let 62% of the benchmark tree
be timed without anyone knowing its output was correct.

⛔⭐ AND IT SPLITS REFLESS FROM OUTSIDE-THE-BASELINE, WHICH IS THE HALF THE ROW EXISTS FOR. Those two read
identically today -- a program with no expected output -- and only one of them is honest:
  * OUTSIDE-BASELINE: the program has NO ref AND the ONE oracle REFUSES it, so no ref CAN exist. It is
    named in an OUTSIDE tsv
    with the measurement that put it there, it is a statement about the ORACLE and never about us (RULES.md
    FACT RULE CEO-542), and per CEO-749 IT STAYS IN THE PUBLISHED DENOMINATOR.
  * REFLESS: nobody has cut the ref yet. It is simply ungraded, and it is work owed.
⛔ THE CLASSES ARE EXCLUSIVE AND HAS-REF WINS, WHICH IS A CHOICE AND IS STATED: a program may both carry a
ref and be listed OUTSIDE (three SNOBOL4 master entries are exactly that), and such a program is counted
HAS-REF here because this census measures REF DEBT, not denominator membership. So the OUTSIDE column reads
"refless, and explained" -- it is the part of the gap that is NOT work owed. Denominator membership is
SUITES.tsv's and the harness's business, and per CEO-749 an OUTSIDE entry stays in the published denominator
either way.

Counting an OUTSIDE program as refless overstates the debt and invites someone to "fix" a row that is about
the oracle; counting a refless program as OUTSIDE hides the debt and narrows the denominator silently. The
census therefore reads all ten OUTSIDE records in the corpus and reports the two populations separately.

⛔ THE OUTSIDE RECORDS USE TWO NAMING CONVENTIONS AND THAT IS MEASURED, NOT ASSUMED: OUTSIDE_SPITBOL_BASELINE
.tsv and OUTSIDE_ARIZONA_BASELINE.tsv under packages/ and benchmarks/, plus tests/snobol4/ALL.outside.tsv --
ten files on 2026-09-21. A census that knew only one convention would silently miss the other's population and
report those programs as refless debt. Both shapes are name<TAB>CLASS<TAB>reason with # comments.

⛔ THE MASTER SUITES ARE NOT PER-FILE AND THE BANNER IS PER-LANGUAGE COMMENT SYNTAX, which is the trap in this
population. tests/<lang>/ALL.<ext> is a CONTAINER: a "program" is an ENTRY indexed in ALL.csv, and its ref is
a banner-delimited block in ALL.ref whose delimiter is that language's OWN comment syntax -- measured on
2026-09-21: icon/raku/rebus "#----", pascal "{----}", snocone "/*----*/", prolog "%----", snobol4 "*----".
A census hand-rolling one regex reads 826 of 826 for icon and ZERO for four other languages, which is exactly
what a first pass with grep produced. So the banner authority is IMPORTED from corpus_suite_harness.py
(banner_re_for + LANG_CONFIGS) and never re-derived here -- RULES.md: lib_* and the harness are sourced
authorities, source them, never copy. If that import fails this population REFUSES rather than guessing.

    ⛔⭐ THE PAIRING IS NOT RE-DERIVED HERE, AND THE FIRST DRAFT PROVED WHY. tests/<lang>/ALL.<ext> is a
    CONTAINER: an entry's ref is either a banner-delimited block (the banner being that language's OWN comment
    syntax -- icon/raku/rebus "#----", pascal "{----}", snocone "/*----*/", prolog "%----", snobol4 "*----")
    or, in the SNOBOL4 dialect, a positional one-line ref with NO marker of its own. SNOBOL4's ALL.ref is
    MIXED: 1162 block entries and 820 one-line entries interleaved in one file. A census that classifies a
    suite as "banner" the moment it finds any banner reads all 820 one-line entries as refless and reports
    817 REFLESS SNOBOL4 ENTRIES THAT ALL HAVE REFS -- a false debt larger than the real one, which is exactly
    the overstatement this row exists to prevent. read_suite()'s own docstring documents that ambiguity and
    resolves it by peeling trailing ref lines off a block's segment for each following one-line entry.

    SO THE DISPATCH IS THE HARNESS'S, COPIED IN SHAPE FROM corpus_suite_harness.py:1223 AND NOT INVENTED:
    a language present in LANG_CONFIGS is a format-(B)-only dialect and is read by read_block_suite() with
    its own banner regex; a language absent from it is the SNOBOL4 default dialect and is read by
    read_suite(). If a reader RAISES, that language REFUSES with the exception rather than reporting zero --
    read_suite() raises ValueError("family.ref is shorter than family.sno") on a pure-banner suite, and
    swallowing that would turn a wrong reader into a clean bill of health.
