# test_gate_gc_emitted_safe_point_matches_its_contract.sh -- THE EMITTED BYTES READ AGAINST WHAT ARCH-GC SECTION 3
# DECLARES (cto 2026-09-21; row gc-the-emitted-safe-point-sequence-is-checked-against-its-declared-contract, ceo
# CEO-1029; from Hawblitzel and Petrank, AUTOMATED VERIFICATION OF PRACTICAL GARBAGE COLLECTORS, POPL 2009).
#
# WHY THIS GATE EXISTS, IN ONE SENTENCE.  ARCH-GC section 3 has read, since the page was written, that a safe point
# is "the return point of an emitted call into a runtime entry that can allocate, placed AFTER the call's result has
# been stored to its mapped slot", and section 3b (CEO-996) is the finding that NOTHING HAS EVER CHECKED THE EMITTED
# BYTES AGAINST IT.  A design sentence stating a property the emitter is never checked against is indistinguishable,
# to every reader and every instrument, from a property the emitter has.  This gate is that check.
#
# ⛔ WHAT A GREEN HERE DOES NOT SAY, WRITTEN FIRST SO NO READER TAKES IT FOR MORE.  It does not say the collector
# VISITS the mapped slot -- that is gc_heap.c and the cfo's file.  It does not say a mapped value is SAFE: a slot the
# map covers is still lost if the tag the recognizer meets is one it refuses.  It cannot see class 3 of section 3c, a
# raw heap pointer returned in a REGISTER PAIR, because a frame map describes memory and there is no store target to
# classify.  It says exactly one thing: at every safe point this reader can place, the emitted side of the section 3
# contract is CHECKED, and the sites it cannot place are NAMED and ratcheted rather than counted green.
#
# ⛔ THE POPULATION IS A DECLARED NAME SET AND NOT THE DIRECTORY GLOB, and that is the coo's rule of 2026-09-21 in
# their words: A GATE WHOSE POPULATION IS A DIRECTORY GLOB CANNOT CARRY A BLOCKING VERDICT WHEN THE DIRECTORY IS
# SHARED -- either the population is a declared name set or the verdict is REPORTED.  scripts/gc_witnesses/ is
# written by five seats, so a witness ARRIVING is a file addition and is REPORTED here, never blocking; a NAMED
# witness's own numbers MOVING is the whole thing this gate is for.

# ⛔ THE FRESHNESS GUARD, AND IT IS HERE BECAUSE THIS GATE'S OWN CLASS OF DEFECT REACHED THE GATES BUILT TO CHASE

# set at 15:03:52 without rebuilding, and 260 arms refused one at a time for that one reason -- while the DARK
# run finished in HALF the wall clock of the honest one, so a seat optimising for a quick gate was being
# rewarded for measuring nothing.  A gate that grades ./scrip with no guard will one day grade a binary older
# than the cure it is testing and call it green.  One line, and the staleness rule itself lives in exactly one
# place (gate_require_fresh in lib_gate.sh) -- this is its calling convention, never a second copy of it.
